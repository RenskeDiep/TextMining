 Congratulations! (Rachel looks devastated),Joey,Ross,Chandler,Monica,Phoebe,
 Ross!,Joey,Ross,Chandler,Monica,Phoebe,
 Not for me. Chip and I broke up!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over…",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, Monica, can you just call it s*x?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! (Walks into the living room and greets Monica's parents.) Hi!",,,,,,Rachel
 Happy Thanksgiving!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! No, not really.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!,,,,,,Rachel
" Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. (Ross is overhearing this.) Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!",,,,,,Rachel
 Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!,,,,,,Rachel
 I know!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!",,,,,,Rachel
 No!,Joey,Ross,Chandler,,,
 So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?,,,Chandler,,,
 Sounds like a date to me.,,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realise I am totally naked.",,,Chandler,,,
" Then I look down, and I realise there's a phone... there.",,,Chandler,,,
 That's right.,,,Chandler,,,
" All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. And it turns out it's my mother, which is very weird, because- she never calls me!",,,Chandler,,,
 Cookie?,,,Chandler,,,
 Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (THE OTHERS STARE AT HIM) Did I say that out loud?,,,Chandler,,,
 And I just want a million dollars! (EXTENDS HIS HAND HOPEFULLY),,,Chandler,,,
" (RE TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.",,,Chandler,,,
" Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?",,,Chandler,,,
" (DEADPAN) Yes, and we're very excited about it. ",,,Chandler,,,
 I have no idea.,,,Chandler,,,
 All finished!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, man.",,,Chandler,,,
 Stay out of my freezer!,,,Chandler,,,
 That is amazing.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hi, Paul, is it?",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... ",,,Chandler,,,
" 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'",,,Chandler,,,
" You're right, I'm sorry. (BURSTS INTO SONG AND DANCES OUT OF THE DOOR) 'Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..'",,,Chandler,,,
 And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, how well you know me...",,,Chandler,,,
" Did you make it, or are you just serving it?",,,Chandler,,,
" Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. I'm Liza Minelli-",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.",,,Chandler,,,
" The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (OFF MONICA'S LOOK) ...now I wish I was dead.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.",,,Chandler,,,
" (AT WINDOW) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!",,,Chandler,,,
 Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!,,,Chandler,,,
 You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...,,,Chandler,,,
 ...Dinah?,,,Chandler,,,
" Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...",,,Chandler,,,
 Boys? We're going in.,,,Chandler,,,
" Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?",,,Chandler,,,
" I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.",,,Chandler,,,
 What does she do?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.",,,Chandler,,,
" I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.",,,Chandler,,,
 Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. ,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.",,,Chandler,,,
" ""So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?""",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, that was really good! ",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay. ""So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?""",,,Chandler,,,
" ""Smoke away.""",,,Chandler,,,
 I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.,,,Chandler,,,
 Relax your hand!,,,Chandler,,,
 Not so much!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, now try taking a puff.",,,Chandler,,,
 Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.,,,Chandler,,,
" It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.",,,Chandler,,,
" Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.",,,Chandler,,,
" Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (TAKES A PUFF) Oh.. my.. God. (CONTINUES TO SMOKE)",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, Satan's minions at work again...",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.",,,Chandler,,,
 And this- is my reward!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, so this time I won't quit!",,,Chandler,,,
" All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (HE DROPS IT IN PHOEBE'S COFFEE)",,,Chandler,,,
 What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (DOES IT)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..",,,Chandler,,,
 I personally could have a gallon of Alan.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, this is so unfair!",,,Chandler,,,
" So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.",,,Chandler,,,
" Really? He does? (TAKES PHONE) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (HANDS BACK THE PHONE AND STUBS OUT HIS CIGARETTE) ",,,Chandler,,,
" Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.",,,Chandler,,,
" Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?",,,Chandler,,,
" (DEADPAN) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.",,,Chandler,,,
" (SARCASTIC) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!",,,Chandler,,,
 ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.,,,Chandler,,,
" (LEAVING) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!",,,Chandler,,,
" (REENTERING) Yeah, alright.",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.",,,Chandler,,,
 You got waaaay too much free time.,,,Chandler,,,
" Happy birthday, pal!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is half empty"".",,,Chandler,,,
 Eleven days before Hallowe'en.. all the good costumes are gone?,,,Chandler,,,
" (TRYING TO STOP ROSS LEAVING) C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (PRETENDING TO PUNCH HIM IN THE STOMACH) huh? huh? huh?",,,Chandler,,,
 (STOPS) I have no idea.,,,Chandler,,,
 You got it.,,,Chandler,,,
" (LOOKING) Oh, this is not that bad.",,,Chandler,,,
 ...Poulet passes it up to Leech! (PASSES TO JOEY),,,Chandler,,,
 We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, Bunny?",,,Chandler,,,
 (TO JOEY) Could've been a peach.,,,Chandler,,,
 What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?,,,Chandler,,,
" (TO ROSS) See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.",,,Chandler,,,
 He's open! ,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!",,,Chandler,,,
 (TO RECEPTIONIST)'Scuse me.,,,Chandler,,,
" Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.",,,Chandler,,,
" Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (TO THE E.R.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (SHE SLIDES THE PANEL BACK. HE TURNS AND IT TAKES HIM BY SURPRISE) Ba-!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?",,,Chandler,,,
 Then what?,,,Chandler,,,
" So in your whole life, you've only been with one- (HE GETS A LOOK TOO) -oh.",,,Chandler,,,
" I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic..",,,Chandler,,,
" No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. ",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.",,,Chandler,,,
" You gotta do it, man.",,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks. (THE GUY NODS AND LEAVES),,,Chandler,,,
" Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.",,,Chandler,,,
" Alright. (TO PHONE) Yes, this is Rachel.",,,Chandler,,,
" To the left, to the left- aww! (THEY COLLAPSE)",,,Chandler,,,
" You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...",,,Chandler,,,
" (STARING AT A WOMAN ACROSS THE ROOM) Ross, ten o'clock.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, ten o'clock.",,,Chandler,,,
" (SIGHS AND GESTURES TO EXPLAIN) There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!",,,Chandler,,,
" She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.",,,Chandler,,,
" Thank you, buddy.",,,Chandler,,,
 Y'think?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...",,,Chandler,,,
 Here goes. (HE WALKS OVER TO HER BUT JUST STANDS THERE),,,Chandler,,,
" Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... (CLEARS HIS THROAT NOISILY)...hi.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. (WALKS BACK TO THE OTHERS BUT SHE CALLS HIM BACK) ",,,Chandler,,,
" (RUNNING BACK) She said yes!! She said yes!! (TO JOEY) Awful play, man. Whoah. (TO ALL) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (TO JOEY) Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. (FISHES A CARD OUT OF HIS POCKET)",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, kids. ",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.",,,Chandler,,,
 It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...,,,Chandler,,,
" Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.",,,Chandler,,,
 We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?",,,Chandler,,,
 Who's Rick?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, so you're divorced?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?",,,Chandler,,,
" So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?",,,Chandler,,,
" Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?",,,Chandler,,,
" So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?",,,Chandler,,,
 ...Hm.,,,Chandler,,,
 What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the s*x; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!",,,Chandler,,,
 Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.,,,Chandler,,,
" Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.",,,Chandler,,,
" Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.",,,Chandler,,,
 Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.,,,Chandler,,,
" C'mon, we're roommates! (HE GOES INTO THE BATHROOM, SCREAMS AND RUNS OUT) My eyes!! My eyes!!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (HE STARTS TO RAID THE FRIDGE)",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? (HE HAS ARMLOADS OF STUFF)",,,Chandler,,,
" God, I love these fingers...",,,Chandler,,,
" No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (KISSES HER AND PULLS HER BACK DOWN)",,,Chandler,,,
 Don't go.,,,Chandler,,,
" (TO HIMSELF) Too bad, she's leaving.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.",,,Chandler,,,
" What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!",,,Chandler,,,
" I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.",,,Chandler,,,
 You.,,,Chandler,,,
" Nono, just you.",,,Chandler,,,
 Lose the other guys.,,,Chandler,,,
" C'mon, we're great together, why not?",,,Chandler,,,
" ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'",,,Chandler,,,
" I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...",,,Chandler,,,
 ...The second guy.,,,Chandler,,,
" Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.",,,Chandler,,,
 (TO ROSS) 'Big guy'?,,,Chandler,,,
 Something so sweet and... disturbing about that.,,,Chandler,,,
 Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?,,,Chandler,,,
" Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes please.,,,Chandler,,,
 He's a he?,,,Chandler,,,
" ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?",,,Chandler,,,
 You did?,,,Chandler,,,
" Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?",,,Chandler,,,
 You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?",,,Chandler,,,
" Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?",,,Chandler,,,
 WHAT IS IT?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.",,,Chandler,,,
" I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, gorgeous.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.",,,Chandler,,,
" So, uh... what do you think it is about me?",,,Chandler,,,
" ...Quality, right, great.",,,Chandler,,,
" Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.",,,Chandler,,,
" No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.",,,Chandler,,,
 Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?",,,Chandler,,,
" Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.",,,Chandler,,,
 You're watching a football game at a funeral?,,,Chandler,,,
" You are a frightening, frightening man.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, no-",,,Chandler,,,
" Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Who are those people?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, Lowell.",,,Chandler,,,
 So how's it going there in Financial Services?,,,Chandler,,,
" Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.",,,Chandler,,,
 Really.,,,Chandler,,,
 So- you can tell?,,,Chandler,,,
" So you don't think I have a, a quality?",,,Chandler,,,
 He is?,,,Chandler,,,
" Out of my league. I could get a Brian. [Brian enters behind him] If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. [Sees him] Hey, Brian.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?,,,Chandler,,,
" That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.",,,Chandler,,,
 Do you know which one you're gonna be?,,,Chandler,,,
" Good luck, man. I hope you get it.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, every single one of them.",,,Chandler,,,
 I thought it was $98.50.,,,Chandler,,,
" I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, I'm nine years old.",,,Chandler,,,
" We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.,,,Chandler,,,
" Tonight, on a very special Blossom.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, you must stop shooping.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.",,,Chandler,,,
 The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?",,,Chandler,,,
 Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?,,,Chandler,,,
 Do either of you have the keys?,,,Chandler,,,
 (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.",,,Chandler,,,
 Now this feels like Thanksgiving.,,,Chandler,,,
 Shall I carve?,,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?",,,Chandler,,,
" I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.",,,Chandler,,,
" Here, here!",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!",,,Chandler,,,
 Might wanna open with the snowman.,,,Chandler,,,
" Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!",,,Chandler,,,
" It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. ",,,Chandler,,,
" [Quietly, to the others] That guy's going home with a note!",,,Chandler,,,
" Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.",,,Chandler,,,
" I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!",,,Chandler,,,
 Too many jokes... must mock Joey! ,,,Chandler,,,
" Aah, y'killing me!",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.",,,Chandler,,,
 Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?,,,Chandler,,,
 I happen to know a Fun Bob.,,,Chandler,,,
" That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.",,,Chandler,,,
 With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.,,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...",,,Chandler,,,
 You remember Janice.,,,Chandler,,,
 [Imitating] But you found me!,,,Chandler,,,
 Kill me. Kill me now. ,,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm sorry you misunderstood...,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, will you give me the thing. [Snatches the camera]",,,Chandler,,,
 [To a woman who he has clearly just met] And then the peacock bit me. [Laughs] Please kiss me at midnight. [She leaves],,,Chandler,,,
" Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.",,,Chandler,,,
 And the moment of joy is upon us.,,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. [Makes kiss noise]",,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!",,,Chandler,,,
 Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?,,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.",,,Chandler,,,
" Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'",,,Chandler,,,
 You can say that because she's not your mom.,,,Chandler,,,
" Shhh, busy beaming with pride.",,,Chandler,,,
 Now why would she say that's embarrassing?,,,Chandler,,,
 THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!,,,Chandler,,,
 This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.,,,Chandler,,,
 ...And then he burst into flames.,,,Chandler,,,
 Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.",,,Chandler,,,
 I know I am.,,,Chandler,,,
" Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.",,,Chandler,,,
 What are you guys doing out here?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside and shuts the door)",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God.,,,Chandler,,,
 I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Joey) You knew about this?,,,Chandler,,,
" I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?,,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.",,,Chandler,,,
 I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door),,,Chandler,,,
 I'm still mad at you for not telling me.,,,Chandler,,,
 You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door),,,Chandler,,,
 What was that?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? (Goes to the counter)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.",,,Chandler,,,
" Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!",,,Chandler,,,
 That's very funny. We done now?,,,Chandler,,,
" That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.",,,Chandler,,,
 You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.,,,Chandler,,,
 Really stupid.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. No. No...,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, okay.",,,Chandler,,,
 Nice save.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.",,,Chandler,,,
 Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.,,,Chandler,,,
 Pretty good! I told her.,,,Chandler,,,
" No-no-no-no, we're done.",,,Chandler,,,
" And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!",,,Chandler,,,
 You think?,,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?",,,Chandler,,,
" What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.",,,Chandler,,,
" What do you mean, like, buy it together?",,,Chandler,,,
 You think we're ready for something like that?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm not moving out.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...",,,Chandler,,,
" It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.",,,Chandler,,,
" Aw, don't do that",,,Chandler,,,
 Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door),,,Chandler,,,
" More coffee over here, please!",,,Chandler,,,
 So what are you gonna do?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.",,,Chandler,,,
 That's patio furniture!,,,Chandler,,,
 (gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?,,,Chandler,,,
 You pick one.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!",,,Chandler,,,
" Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)",,,Chandler,,,
" So, what do you think?",,,Chandler,,,
 I know!,,,Chandler,,,
" What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!",,,Chandler,,,
" My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off into the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)",,,Chandler,,,
 Wha-,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, get out!",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Joey) One more game?,,,Chandler,,,
 I'm sorry!,,,Chandler,,,
" Rachel, wait, wait.",,,Chandler,,,
 Can I just say one thing?,,,Chandler,,,
 That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yes, could I have one of those-",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.",,,Chandler,,,
 It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.,,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okaaay, [Gestures] rock, hard place, me.",,,Chandler,,,
" Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?",,,Chandler,,,
 Huh.,,,Chandler,,,
" Uh-huh, how did you know that?",,,Chandler,,,
 [Without looking up] What? [Looks up] What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, I don't see that happening?",,,Chandler,,,
 Well I'm not showing you my 'tat'.,,,Chandler,,,
" [Sarcastic] Oh, good. Rog is here.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?",,,Chandler,,,
" Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.",,,Chandler,,,
" So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?",,,Chandler,,,
" C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by 'No thanks, it's late'. ",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you're gonna.",,,Chandler,,,
" Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?",,,Chandler,,,
" No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say- 'No thanks, I'm married'.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. I really do.,,,Chandler,,,
 Get off!,,,Chandler,,,
 [Comes out of his room] What? What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Sorry, my- my thing was in there with me.",,,Chandler,,,
 Basically we just feel that he's...,,,Chandler,,,
 Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.,,,Chandler,,,
" If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.",,,Chandler,,,
 Any contact?,,,Chandler,,,
" Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian--I don't think we need a third...",,,Chandler,,,
 I think it's winning.,,,Chandler,,,
" She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a--",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes! Way to go, man! [Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.] Still got the egg, huh?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, uh, I... don't... care. [Joey's date shows up] Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.",,,Chandler,,,
 ...And what did you bring?,,,Chandler,,,
 Janice?,,,Chandler,,,
" [angrily] Hey, it's Janice.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. [gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear] Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!",,,Chandler,,,
 That's OK.,,,Chandler,,,
 [disgusted] What? What can't you do?,,,Chandler,,,
" Tell me it's ""you and me"" we.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, you can not do this to me.",,,Chandler,,,
 I hope she throws up on you.,,,Chandler,,,
 So...,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, what a crappy night!",,,Chandler,,,
" Excuse me. [gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him] How ya doin'?",,,Chandler,,,
 Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?,,,Chandler,,,
" You got it. Good woman! [the waiter turns around, it's a man] Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?",,,Chandler,,,
" That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. [to Janice] I've always wanted to know...",,,Chandler,,,
" No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, well, this was very special.",,,Chandler,,,
 Janice is gonna go away now.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, good, Joey's home now.",,,Chandler,,,
 How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hi, Just Janice.",,,Chandler,,,
" Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. [reading the candy] Chan and Jan Forever.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.",,,Chandler,,,
 [surprised] It is?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no, you see, actually it is.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, no I don't.",,,Chandler,,,
" I did, but--",,,Chandler,,,
 Call me!,,,Chandler,,,
" This is unbelievable. It's been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, you'd be looking like a ham right about now.",,,Chandler,,,
 It's Phoebe! Hi!,,,Chandler,,,
" Wait, wait! Wh-What are you doing here?",,,Chandler,,,
 Can we start over?,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn't look exactly like her sister.",,,Chandler,,,
 They're twins!,,,Chandler,,,
" You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things. Let's not do that anymore.",,,Chandler,,,
 Your sister Ursula.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh--",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven't talked in like years.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, and I've got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in gym.",,,Chandler,,,
" And (buzzing noise) to you too, Helen.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, ok. Send her in.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hi, Nina. Come on in.",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, Yes. Yes. I've just been going over your data here, and little thing, you've been post-dating your Friday numbers.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.",,,Chandler,,,
 WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net Usage Statistics.,,,Chandler,,,
" It's not just that she's cute, ok. It's just that she's really really cute.",,,Chandler,,,
" So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, where you been?",,,Chandler,,,
 Score.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, listen. Before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by, uh--",,,Chandler,,,
" Mr. D, how's it going, sir??",,,Chandler,,,
 And?,,,Chandler,,,
 So what does this mean?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very--",,,Chandler,,,
 Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, yes I am. Listen, the reason that I called you in here today is, uh, please don't hate me.",,,Chandler,,,
 Would you like to have dinner sometime?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you still haven't taken down the Christmas lights.",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm just trying to find the right moment, you know?",,,Chandler,,,
" You know, once you're inside, you don't have to knock anymore.",,,Chandler,,,
" Wow, this is serious. I've never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.",,,Chandler,,,
" Knit, good woman, knit, knit!",,,Chandler,,,
 And that's the Chrysler building right there.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, yes she is. Didn't I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, uh, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Fl---, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan, and uh, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly. In fact, he uh, mentioned the word ""frenzy"".",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, no, no. Nina--she is whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.",,,Chandler,,,
" And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself or others.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir.",,,Chandler,,,
" You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, sure, Nina. What's up?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, well, uh, maybe that's because they're uh, jealous of us.",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, well, maybe that's, uh, because you're getting a big raise.",,,Chandler,,,
" Sure, why not?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, you don't know. Helen, would you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise?",,,Chandler,,,
 Helen drinks. Will you marry me?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I ended up telling her everything.",,,Chandler,,,
" Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: If you're ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand on the desk.",,,Chandler,,,
 You're not gonna lose him.,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you crazy? That's a baby!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, only if you order stuff.",,,Chandler,,,
 There it is! So what're you gonna do?,,,Chandler,,,
 And your friend Phoebe?,,,Chandler,,,
" Man if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, what have we learned so far?",,,Chandler,,,
 Happy birthday Peehee.,,,Chandler,,,
 Did you see Betty?,,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father. Say your son never feels connected to you as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.",,,Chandler,,,
" You know, you'd think I would. What's up with the simian? ROSS: It's just a furball.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, who's turn is it?",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, you got zero points for ""idney"".",,,Chandler,,,
 Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.,,,Chandler,,,
" We think he was trying to spell out ""monkey"".",,,Chandler,,,
" So, you feel like a dad yet?",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.",,,Chandler,,,
" You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?",,,Chandler,,,
 Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?,,,Chandler,,,
 ...little playthings with yarn?,,,Chandler,,,
 Could you want her more?,,,Chandler,,,
" [sarcastically] Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.",,,Chandler,,,
 We're not--we're not saying anything.,,,Chandler,,,
" [to the girls] We were playing poker, alright...",,,Chandler,,,
 And then he did.,,,Chandler,,,
 There just don't happen to be any women in our games.,,,Chandler,,,
" [teaching] OK, so now we draw cards.",,,Chandler,,,
" OK Phoebs, how many do you want?",,,Chandler,,,
" [changing subject] OK, so at this point, the dealer--",,,Chandler,,,
" OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. [holds up two cards] Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. [Joey is unamused] Alright babe, deal the cards.",,,Chandler,,,
" Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.",,,Chandler,,,
" The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? [mimicking]: When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!",,,Chandler,,,
" Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?",,,Chandler,,,
" That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!",,,Chandler,,,
 Couldn't be more out. [throws in cards],,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, I've had dates like this.",,,Chandler,,,
 Call.,,,Chandler,,,
" [to Ross]: What do you need, what do you need?",,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, here's ten. [gives it to him]",,,Chandler,,,
 Good luck.,,,Chandler,,,
 [to Ross]: I thought we had them!,,,Chandler,,,
 Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!,,,Chandler,,,
 Go.,,,Chandler,,,
 Toootal chick-flick.,,,Chandler,,,
" They're still just friends, right?",,,Chandler,,,
 I can't believe we are even having this discussion.,,,Chandler,,,
" I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?",,,Chandler,,,
 I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.",,,Chandler,,,
 Rachel lost Marcel.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.",,,Chandler,,,
 Marcel?,,,Chandler,,,
 Marcel?,,,Chandler,,,
" Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we- we were looking for something...",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes have you seen any?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.",,,Chandler,,,
 Marcel?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Eh. I thought that was an alp.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any s*x I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.",,,Chandler,,,
 I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.,,,Chandler,,,
 I feel violated. And not in a good way.,,,Chandler,,,
" I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...",,,Chandler,,,
" Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (THE GIRLS MAKE DISGUSTED NOISES) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (TO THE GUYS) I'm right, right?",,,Chandler,,,
" Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (CALLS HER, THEN HURRIEDLY HANGS UP) I got her machine.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, no no no no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase 'Yes indeedy-o'.",,,Chandler,,,
" (BLUFFING) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Rach!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes!,,,Chandler,,,
 I have my reasons.,,,Chandler,,,
" (ON PHONE; READING FROM A SCRIPT) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (RATTLES SOME DISHES) Bye bye. (HANGS UP) Oh God!",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, I've been honing!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",,,Chandler,,,
 What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.,,,Chandler,,,
 Can I use your phone?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?",,,Chandler,,,
 Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...,,,Chandler,,,
" Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.",,,Chandler,,,
 She answered.,,,Chandler,,,
" I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.",,,Chandler,,,
" If it helps, I could slide over.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hello? Hello?,,,Chandler,,,
 So how's Mindy?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hell is filled with people like you.,,,Chandler,,,
 ...And boogie!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?",,,Chandler,,,
" I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.",,,Chandler,,,
" No! (CALLS) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. (PUTS DOWN PHONE) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. (DOES A LITTLE JIG) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...",,,Chandler,,,
 'S'why I'm dancing...,,,Chandler,,,
" Ring dammit, ring!",,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
" (INVESTIGATING) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!",,,Chandler,,,
 Nngghhh!!!!!!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.",,,Chandler,,,
 What are you doing here?,,,Chandler,,,
" ...I'm, I'm okay.",,,Chandler,,,
" That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 ...I dunno.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?",,,Chandler,,,
" Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, that's what we said about Joey...",,,Chandler,,,
 How about Joey... Pepponi?,,,Chandler,,,
 Joey... Switzerland?,,,Chandler,,,
 Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it does not ring a bell with me...",,,Chandler,,,
 Might wanna try Joseph.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.",,,Chandler,,,
" She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?",,,Chandler,,,
 So what does this mean?,,,Chandler,,,
" I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?",,,Chandler,,,
" I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.,,,Chandler,,,
 ...Take off their hats!,,,Chandler,,,
 You're kidding.,,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, you'd think I would've.",,,Chandler,,,
 -He's in.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.",,,Chandler,,,
 Tell me what?,,,Chandler,,,
" [sarcastically] Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women wonīt look at me.",,,Chandler,,,
 Wow!,,,Chandler,,,
" More importantly, was I any good?",,,Chandler,,,
" Interesting, cause in my dreams, Iīm allways surprisingly inadequate. [Monica pats him on his lap]",,,Chandler,,,
 Youīre okay there?,,,Chandler,,,
" Iīm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody elseīs subconscious.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi Rachel.,,,Chandler,,,
 Pirates again?,,,Chandler,,,
" [sarcasticly] Thanks Joey, thatīs a good idea.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. Itīs a whole big boob story.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you know Phoebs. I donīt know if itīs your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.",,,Chandler,,,
" A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.",,,Chandler,,,
 When we were?,,,Chandler,,,
 And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?,,,Chandler,,,
 Can you hear that?,,,Chandler,,,
 See Thatīll stop when you pick up the phone.,,,Chandler,,,
 Iīm not in a meeting. Iīm right... Whoops.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Ah!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, now, I actually have to get to work.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Bye bye.,,,Chandler,,,
 Ooh. [leans against the desk],,,Chandler,,,
" See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. [Joey and Ross wonder what he means] Me.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why not?,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Noho. Why doesnīt they like me?,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you talking about?,,,Chandler,,,
 I canīt belive it.,,,Chandler,,,
 They do me?,,,Chandler,,,
 I donīt sound like that.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I donīt sound like that. That is so not true.",,,Chandler,,,
" That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?",,,Chandler,,,
 And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.,,,Chandler,,,
 Tyrannosaurus!,,,Chandler,,,
 Work people? Nobody told me.,,,Chandler,,,
" You know, I donīt get this. A month aga, these people were my friends. You know, just because Iīm in charge doesnīt mean iīm a different person.",,,Chandler,,,
 You think I should?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing ""Ebony and Ivory"".",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Then, I donīt get it.",,,Chandler,,,
 They do?,,,Chandler,,,
 I just wanīt to--,,,Chandler,,,
 But I just wa--,,,Chandler,,,
" Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, Iīm gonna need them on my desk by nine oīclock.",,,Chandler,,,
" You have to give īem something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and whoīs the guy with the moustache?",,,Chandler,,,
" Petrie, right, right. Okay, somebodyīs gonna be working this weekend.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey Ross, look what Iīve got going here.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, like in a cab--",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, hating this.",,,Chandler,,,
" Here we go, here we go.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen, 'cause I like to be surprised.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, Rache, can I get--",,,Chandler,,,
 Not yet.,,,Chandler,,,
" So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.",,,Chandler,,,
 God?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, maybe it was God, doing me.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you owe me one, big guy.",,,Chandler,,,
" He said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself without any outside help whatsoever.",,,Chandler,,,
 You have to really wanna see it.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?,,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.",,,Chandler,,,
 You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!,,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.",,,Chandler,,,
 What stupid thing did you do?,,,Chandler,,,
 People do stupid things when they're upset.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.",,,Chandler,,,
 Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?,,,Chandler,,,
 At least as long as I have the pants.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yo, paisan. Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man.",,,Chandler,,,
 Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.,,,Chandler,,,
" He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite--",,,Chandler,,,
 Cupping.,,,Chandler,,,
" Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.",,,Chandler,,,
 That's ok.,,,Chandler,,,
" You know, it's...something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.",,,Chandler,,,
 We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?,,,Chandler,,,
" Carol, Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?",,,Chandler,,,
" So, uh, how often can you do it?",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, sweetums.",,,Chandler,,,
" Come on, you're going to Bloomingdales with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.",,,Chandler,,,
 What did you just do?,,,Chandler,,,
 What did you just do?,,,Chandler,,,
 Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.,,,Chandler,,,
 Howdy.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.",,,Chandler,,,
 What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?",,,Chandler,,,
 You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.,,,Chandler,,,
 All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 I broke up with her.,,,Chandler,,,
" They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.",,,Chandler,,,
 You or me?,,,Chandler,,,
 Maureen Rosilla.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, Phoebe.",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.",,,Chandler,,,
" Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, look at this. ""My Big Book of Grievances.""",,,Chandler,,,
" April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.",,,Chandler,,,
" Wow, he looks so normal.",,,Chandler,,,
 Funniest? Heckles?,,,Chandler,,,
" Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?",,,Chandler,,,
 Whoa!,,,Chandler,,,
" Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.",,,Chandler,,,
" I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?",,,Chandler,,,
" Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.",,,Chandler,,,
" Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.",,,Chandler,,,
" What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it ""supposably""?",,,Chandler,,,
 How do you know that? How?,,,Chandler,,,
" You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I understand.",,,Chandler,,,
 You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.,,,Chandler,,,
" (on phone) Hi, it's me.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, my, god!",,,Chandler,,,
" Janice, you're--",,,Chandler,,,
 Is it--?,,,Chandler,,,
 Congratulations.,,,Chandler,,,
 You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?,,,Chandler,,,
 Neat. I'm gonna die alone.,,,Chandler,,,
" Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.",,,Chandler,,,
" If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. ""Run away from Crazy Snake Man,"" they'll shout!",,,Chandler,,,
" Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.",,,Chandler,,,
 In a bad way?,,,Chandler,,,
 Whoa! Don't know about that.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.",,,Chandler,,,
 I'll take that.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.",,,Chandler,,,
" Takin' that with you, huh?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.",,,Chandler,,,
" Sure. (My god, that's a big head! It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work. All right, don't get hung up on it, quick, quick, list five things you like about her: Nice smile, good dresser...Big head, big head, big head!)",,,Chandler,,,
 I didn't know it was a big secret.,,,Chandler,,,
 You bitch.,,,Chandler,,,
" C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.",,,Chandler,,,
 Joey was in a porno movie.,,,Chandler,,,
" If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.",,,Chandler,,,
" Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.",,,Chandler,,,
" Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . . ",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, Julie.",,,Chandler,,,
" Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.",,,Chandler,,,
 What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.,,,Chandler,,,
" OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.",,,Chandler,,,
 Nice work my friend.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.",,,Chandler,,,
 I got the time to get to know Julie.,,,Chandler,,,
 I'm goin' home.,,,Chandler,,,
" Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. (phone rings)",,,Chandler,,,
" No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Bob here.,,,Chandler,,,
 (on phone) What've you been up to?,,,Chandler,,,
 Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. (to Ross) I love her.,,,Chandler,,,
 I'm back.,,,Chandler,,,
" Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?",,,Chandler,,,
 Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.,,,Chandler,,,
" I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look guys, I know it's a little steep.",,,Chandler,,,
 But it's Ross.,,,Chandler,,,
" I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.",,,Chandler,,,
" You know, I think I might just.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.",,,Chandler,,,
" We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.",,,Chandler,,,
 All right.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hi.,,,Chandler,,,
" Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.",,,Chandler,,,
 Whoever stood you up is a jerk.,,,Chandler,,,
" I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?",,,Chandler,,,
" No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. (to Ross) I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.",,,Chandler,,,
" I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?",,,Chandler,,,
" Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.",,,Chandler,,,
 You can tell us.,,,Chandler,,,
 We can talk about that.,,,Chandler,,,
" So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?",,,Chandler,,,
" No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.",,,Chandler,,,
 Together.,,,Chandler,,,
" So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?",,,Chandler,,,
" Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?",,,Chandler,,,
" By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.",,,Chandler,,,
" Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!",,,Chandler,,,
" If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why did you look at me when you said that?,,,Chandler,,,
 Fine.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had s*x today.,,,Chandler,,,
" Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.",,,Chandler,,,
" Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.",,,Chandler,,,
 I had s*x today. I never have to answer that phone again.,,,Chandler,,,
 Bob here.,,,Chandler,,,
" So, uh, you met someone, huh?",,,Chandler,,,
" So, uh, how was he?",,,Chandler,,,
 Eh?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, that makes me feel so good.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.",,,Chandler,,,
" So, let's go.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.",,,Chandler,,,
 I can't believe the guys missed this.,,,Chandler,,,
 Chandler.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, we really missed you guys.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.",,,Chandler,,,
 I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.,,,Chandler,,,
 I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes.,,,Chandler,,,
 No.,,,Chandler,,,
" You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.",,,Chandler,,,
" Can I uh see something? (Takes Ben. When he puts him close to Monica, Ben cries. When he moves Ben away, he stops crying.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.",,,Chandler,,,
 We'll watch him.,,,Chandler,,,
" I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.",,,Chandler,,,
 You understood that?,,,Chandler,,,
 Is he the one with the beautiful wife?,,,Chandler,,,
" You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?",,,Chandler,,,
" No, I got him.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, seriously you want him?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, we are great guys.",,,Chandler,,,
" That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!",,,Chandler,,,
 (to taxi driver) Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.",,,Chandler,,,
 You done?,,,Chandler,,,
 You know it?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, sure, they love us over there.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.",,,Chandler,,,
" (on pay phone) Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.",,,Chandler,,,
 That's me.,,,Chandler,,,
" Actually, uh, we're both the father. (Puts his arm around Joey)",,,Chandler,,,
 Please tell me you know which one is our baby.,,,Chandler,,,
 Ok.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.",,,Chandler,,,
 What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, call it in the air.",,,Chandler,,,
 Heads it is.,,,Chandler,,,
 We have to assign heads to something.,,,Chandler,,,
 What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?,,,Chandler,,,
" (looking fearfully at Joey) Hey, he's not crying.",,,Chandler,,,
" You, you are gonna love this. ",,,Chandler,,,
" Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.",,,Chandler,,,
 And twenty-five it is.,,,Chandler,,,
" Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?",,,Chandler,,,
 Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.,,,Chandler,,,
 What's in the bag?,,,Chandler,,,
" Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.",,,Chandler,,,
 Who said anything about Christmas?,,,Chandler,,,
 So whaddya got there Monica?,,,Chandler,,,
 Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Eeeshk.,,,Chandler,,,
 OK.,,,Chandler,,,
" OK. [reads paper] Brake left, gas right?",,,Chandler,,,
 [grabs for seat belt] Where's my seat belt?,,,Chandler,,,
 [Chandler gets in the back seat] Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, so that's what this is for.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 Alright.,,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, we're gettin' closer.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, so why not go knock?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. [Ross and Phoebe hug, Monica and Rachel hug, Chandler is left standing]",,,Chandler,,,
" OK, Phoebs, your turn.",,,Chandler,,,
" And, a lemon lime.",,,Chandler,,,
 And last but not least.,,,Chandler,,,
" [singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood] Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.",,,Chandler,,,
" Whoa, she's pretty.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, ok.",,,Chandler,,,
 Nice!,,,Chandler,,,
 For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.,,,Chandler,,,
" That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah.",,,Chandler,,,
 That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?",,,Chandler,,,
" Believe me, sometimes that happens.",,,Chandler,,,
" You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.",,,Chandler,,,
 Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.,,,Chandler,,,
" Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah?",,,Chandler,,,
" [to an attractive woman] I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? [The woman walks away]",,,Chandler,,,
 [to the woman who just rejected him] All right look. pen1s schmenis. We're all people. [She walks away again.],,,Chandler,,,
 Isn't Ben in this?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.",,,Chandler,,,
 Rhythm?,,,Chandler,,,
" You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.",,,Chandler,,,
 Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. [both laugh hysterically],,,Chandler,,,
 Hello.,,,Chandler,,,
" [Joey grabs a frying pan] Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.",,,Chandler,,,
 The one time they're not home.,,,Chandler,,,
 That's how radio stars escape stalkers.,,,Chandler,,,
" Wait, wait, wait. [Opens the top of the dish soap he's holding]",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.",,,Chandler,,,
 Very informative!,,,Chandler,,,
 That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.,,,Chandler,,,
" And you left the toilet seat up, you b*st*rd. [throws water in his face]",,,Chandler,,,
" What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?",,,Chandler,,,
" [to guys wering yellow isolation suits] So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.",,,Chandler,,,
" [to an extra in fatigues] Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.",,,Chandler,,,
 Ahhhh.,,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, yes, yes it is.",,,Chandler,,,
 Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?,,,Chandler,,,
" Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.",,,Chandler,,,
" OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh uh, o, OK.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.",,,Chandler,,,
 No one was around to hear that?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.",,,Chandler,,,
" Like, when you're cooking a steak.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?",,,Chandler,,,
" OK, then, eat me, I'm done.",,,Chandler,,,
" I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'",,,Chandler,,,
" Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.",,,Chandler,,,
 You want me to wear your panties?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.,,,Chandler,,,
 Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.,,,Chandler,,,
" Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa [Susie grabs him under the table] They do have the shrimp.",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm going to the bathroom now. [leaves for the bathroom],,,Chandler,,,
 I can't believe we're doing this.,,,Chandler,,,
 Alrighty. [we see Chandler's pants drop from under the stall door],,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh.,,,Chandler,,,
" OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?",,,Chandler,,,
 OK.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.",,,Chandler,,,
" Huh? Where, whaddya mean?",,,Chandler,,,
" What, what's what you mean?",,,Chandler,,,
 That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?,,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.",,,Chandler,,,
 Joey?,,,Chandler,,,
 Joey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.",,,Chandler,,,
 Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, this is the first time.",,,Chandler,,,
" I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.",,,Chandler,,,
" No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, you don't have to see.",,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, one of you give me your underpants.",,,Chandler,,,
 How can you not be wearing any underwear?,,,Chandler,,,
 Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?",,,Chandler,,,
 How long you been waitin' to say that?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey. Hold on a second. [shoots a goal] Huh?,,,Chandler,,,
 What's this?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.",,,Chandler,,,
" Wow, I don't know what to say. [opens the box and pulls out an incredibly gaudy gold bracelet] Wow, I, I don't know what to say.",,,Chandler,,,
 I don't know. It's a bracelet.,,,Chandler,,,
 [reads] To my best bud. [puts it back in the case] Thanks best bud.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, now? [puts it in his desk drawer] No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion. [sets a chair in front of the drawer]",,,Chandler,,,
 I so am.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, she's goin' somewhere.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, you feelin' better?",,,Chandler,,,
" Ya know, the man's got a point. [gestures with his arm and the bracelet falls off]",,,Chandler,,,
" That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, I'm alright, thanks.",,,Chandler,,,
" [walks over to the woman] I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.",,,Chandler,,,
" Chandler. [waves his arm around, exposing the bracelet]",,,Chandler,,,
" What? [realizes it was the bracelet] Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]",,,Chandler,,,
" I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. [Joey turns around and walks out without saying anything] That's actually good.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? [Joey doesn't respond] Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? [Throws a basketball to Joey. Joey doesn't move to catch it and the ball takes out a lamp] OK, that's my bad.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?",,,Chandler,,,
" OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. [Joey goes to his room and shuts the door] Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . [notices the bracelet is missing from his wrist] wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there. [he starts searching the room, lifting up the couch cushions]",,,Chandler,,,
" I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . . [Joey returns to his room]",,,Chandler,,,
 I can't believe it.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay. [sits down at the bar]",,,Chandler,,,
" What am I gonna do, huh? [Joey walks in behind him]",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Well this one's for you.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, [puts bracelet on Joey] it's about you and me and the fact that we're [reading bracelet] best buds.",,,Chandler,,,
 That's what they'll call us.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.",,,Chandler,,,
" OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?",,,Chandler,,,
 Work on your music?,,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.",,,Chandler,,,
 Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.,,,Chandler,,,
 Congratulations!,,,Chandler,,,
 Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.,,,Chandler,,,
" So uh, which one is mine?",,,Chandler,,,
 [sits down] Ohh yes.,,,Chandler,,,
 [reaches for the footrest lever] Do we dare?,,,Chandler,,,
 Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.,,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.",,,Chandler,,,
 I'll cancel the sodas.,,,Chandler,,,
 You got a Cheeto on your face man.[Joey removes the Cheeto and eats it],,,Chandler,,,
 So how'd it go?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.",,,Chandler,,,
 It's the Miracle Wax.,,,Chandler,,,
" Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.",,,Chandler,,,
 Could you get us a couple of beers?,,,Chandler,,,
 She's one of us now.,,,Chandler,,,
 Well maybe he was nervous.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah. [feels the floor] Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.",,,Chandler,,,
" That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.",,,Chandler,,,
 Waaa-aaah.,,,Chandler,,,
 The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.,,,Chandler,,,
 Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. [Joey gets a sheepish look] You used my toothbrush?,,,Chandler,,,
" Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.",,,Chandler,,,
 Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?",,,Chandler,,,
" Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?",,,Chandler,,,
" I know, this is a great apartment.",,,Chandler,,,
" Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.",,,Chandler,,,
" [being left behind] Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.",,,Chandler,,,
 Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.",,,Chandler,,,
 Well then maybe you should take it.,,,Chandler,,,
 Fine with me.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah me too.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .,,,Chandler,,,
 So I got ya something. [tosses Joey a bag of plastic spoons],,,Chandler,,,
 Lick away my man.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?",,,Chandler,,,
 Well I didn't think that was serious. [grabs the spoons back] Ya know I thought that was just a fight.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, there you go.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.",,,Chandler,,,
 I did pay for half of it.,,,Chandler,,,
" Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.",,,Chandler,,,
 Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.,,,Chandler,,,
 Stop talkin' to your men. [Joey scores],,,Chandler,,,

" Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?",,,Chandler,,,
" See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.",,,Chandler,,,
" But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.",,,Chandler,,,
 But...,,,Chandler,,,
" So uhh, how's the palace?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?,,,Chandler,,,
 Morning.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh it's uh, over there on the table.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, ooh.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.",,,Chandler,,,
 See ya. [Eddie leaves],,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I couldn't be happier.",,,Chandler,,,
 There's another carton right over there.,,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, so what's it about?",,,Chandler,,,
 Well I like both eggs equally.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?",,,Chandler,,,
" [stares in disbeliefe] Yeah o-, OK, alright. [oven timer goes off] Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.",,,Chandler,,,
 You don't like that show?,,,Chandler,,,
 Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh o-, OK man.",,,Chandler,,,
 [reluctantly sings] You're obviously not their favorite pet.,,,Chandler,,,
 God that is good TV.,,,Chandler,,,
" Phoebs, play with meeee.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.",,,Chandler,,,
" No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.",,,Chandler,,,
 We don't need to remedy that.,,,Chandler,,,
 That was so lame.,,,Chandler,,,
" So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?",,,Chandler,,,
 What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.,,,Chandler,,,
 Well it's not Sean Penn.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hi.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, oh, c'mon in.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...",,,Chandler,,,
 Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.,,,Chandler,,,
 Bye.,,,Chandler,,,
" So, we gettin' a fish?",,,Chandler,,,
" Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.",,,Chandler,,,
" This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.",,,Chandler,,,
 Buddy?,,,Chandler,,,
 There was no fish when she dropped it off.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie...[puts his hand on Eddie's shoulder] Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? [picks up the fruit an tosses it to Eddie, it hits Eddie in the chest and falls]",,,Chandler,,,
" So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.",,,Chandler,,,
 Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.,,,Chandler,,,
" Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.",,,Chandler,,,
 We're worried about you.,,,Chandler,,,
 We came over as soon as we saw.,,,Chandler,,,
 It's gonna be ok. You know that?,,,Chandler,,,
 I'm sorry man.,,,Chandler,,,
 Uhhhaahh.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?",,,Chandler,,,
" [throws it across the room while Eddie's not looking] Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?",,,Chandler,,,
" [looks in the fish bowl to see a fish cracker] Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, good night. [walks towards his room] You big freak of nature.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?,,,Chandler,,,
 Why?,,,Chandler,,,
 I can't sleep now.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.,,,Chandler,,,
 I didn't realize that.,,,Chandler,,,
 GET OUT NOW!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes please.,,,Chandler,,,
 I want you out.,,,Chandler,,,
 Where did you hear it from before?,,,Chandler,,,
 Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?,,,Chandler,,,
" Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?",,,Chandler,,,
" Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?",,,Chandler,,,
 Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...,,,Chandler,,,
 Your last roommate's kidney?,,,Chandler,,,
 Daaahhhh!,,,Chandler,,,
" Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.",,,Chandler,,,
 Uuuh.,,,Chandler,,,
" Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.",,,Chandler,,,
" You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!",,,Chandler,,,
 Uh-huh.,,,Chandler,,,
" This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.",,,Chandler,,,
 You want some help.,,,Chandler,,,
" [enters] Ding dong, the psycho's gone.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!",,,Chandler,,,
 Our next cocktail party?,,,Chandler,,,
" Eddie, do you remember yesterday?",,,Chandler,,,
 Do you remember talking to me yesterday?,,,Chandler,,,
 So what happened?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh sweet Moses.,,,Chandler,,,
 May I help you?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I'm, I'm sorry...[Eddie forces his head in the door] Ahhh. Have we met?",,,Chandler,,,
" I, I'm sorry, I uh [unchains the door and opens it all the way] I already have a roommate. [Joey turns around in the leather recliner]",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.",,,Chandler,,,
 See ya. [shuts the door] Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?,,,Chandler,,,
 Welcome home man. [they hug and jump around],,,Chandler,,,
 Absolutely.,,,Chandler,,,
 Ah that's a cantelope.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?",,,Chandler,,,
" So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, how do you find clothes that fit?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. [starts poking Monica in the shoulder] 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, that's Eric.",,,Chandler,,,
" I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old [Monica gives him a glare] -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, this could be tough.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ooh, you almost had it.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Your boyfriend is so cool.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.",,,Chandler,,,
" You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car [passes the dollar back].",,,Chandler,,,
 I think they get it.,,,Chandler,,,
 There's the man.,,,Chandler,,,
" Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, didn't he tell ya?",,,Chandler,,,
 You hear that? We're the guys.,,,Chandler,,,
" [runs in] Hey, big guy, game time.",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.",,,Chandler,,,
 Kick save and... denied.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.",,,Chandler,,,
" See, that's why we don't let her play.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.",,,Chandler,,,
 No.,,,Chandler,,,
" Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.",,,Chandler,,,
" No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.",,,Chandler,,,
 You're not a dad. You're not a dad.,,,Chandler,,,
 I can't believe you got us into trouble. [slaps Joey on the arm. Joey takes exception and slaps him back],,,Chandler,,,
" Man, I am so beat.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?",,,Chandler,,,
" No actually, I was just going for colorful.",,,Chandler,,,
 What just happened?,,,Chandler,,,
" That, that is funny. Can I have it back?",,,Chandler,,,
 No?,,,Chandler,,,
" Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?",,,Chandler,,,
" No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.",,,Chandler,,,
 The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ohhh [turns as if to hug someone] Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.",,,Chandler,,,
" Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?,,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.",,,Chandler,,,
 Don't play with his things.,,,Chandler,,,
 You had to ask.,,,Chandler,,,
 I think you played the Gunther card too soon.,,,Chandler,,,
 Your cappucino sir.,,,Chandler,,,
 Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.,,,Chandler,,,
"Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.",,,Chandler,,,
 Ok.,,,Chandler,,,
 No?,,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, hang on a second there Custer.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.",,,Chandler,,,
 Would you come on! Come on! [waitress brings their coffee] Thank you.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ah, there we go.",,,Chandler,,,
 You burn your mouth?,,,Chandler,,,
" Bullies, big bullies.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.",,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, let's do this.",,,Chandler,,,
" Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.",,,Chandler,,,
 Ok. [reaches in his pocket],,,Chandler,,,
 Ok.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff! [some guy runs off with the hat]",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok so, can I have my hat back?",,,Chandler,,,
 Huh. [reaches over and grabs the hat and bolts for the door but slips and falls behind the couch],,,Chandler,,,
 Hi Monica.,,,Chandler,,,
" Guys guys, check this out.",,,Chandler,,,
" Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.",,,Chandler,,,
 Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why her mom?,,,Chandler,,,
 Excuse me?,,,Chandler,,,
" This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?",,,Chandler,,,
" So, basically just a Chinese guy.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes because uh, you look so young.",,,Chandler,,,
" NO! No, I'll take that for ya.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?",,,Chandler,,,
" Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.",,,Chandler,,,
" Alright you guys are off to party number one [ushers 3 guys into Monica's apartment] and you, you are off to party number two [ushers four women into his apartment. Two guys try to follow and Chandler blocks them and shoos them off to Monica's apartment] Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, they're coming, shhh. [Runs into Monica's apartment and grabs one last girl to take to his apartment]",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, we could count again.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, are you gonna be ok?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, actually just one birthday flan.",,,Chandler,,,
" It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.",,,Chandler,,,
" Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.",,,Chandler,,,
 Volleyball.,,,Chandler,,,
" Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, that's me. [runs back]",,,Chandler,,,
" [running out of his apartment after a girl] Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. [sits down beside Rachel] Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.",,,Chandler,,,
 Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?,,,Chandler,,,
" I, I know. [Hugs her. Ross walks out and Chandler puts her in his arms.]",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?",,,Chandler,,,
" Sorry, we're on a major flan high.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...",,,Chandler,,,
 No.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, you can have it. [He licks it and offers it to her.]",,,Chandler,,,
 That was there when I got here. [Takes a bite of his muffin.],,,Chandler,,,
 Had it.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.",,,Chandler,,,
" It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.",,,Chandler,,,
 I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, how's the first day goin'?",,,Chandler,,,
 Well there you go.,,,Chandler,,,
" Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?",,,Chandler,,,
 Weird world. Your kids?,,,Chandler,,,
 Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.",,,Chandler,,,
 Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.",,,Chandler,,,
 Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.,,,Chandler,,,
" It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, if you say so sir.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I'm going to kill you.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why?,,,Chandler,,,
 Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?,,,Chandler,,,
" Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?",,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.",,,Chandler,,,
" I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.",,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.",,,Chandler,,,
" No freakshow, she's fictional.",,,Chandler,,,
 Thank you.,,,Chandler,,,
 'Cause he was just so darn cute.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, what did your agent say?",,,Chandler,,,
 And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.,,,Chandler,,,
 I may have.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.",,,Chandler,,,
" I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...",,,Chandler,,,
" Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.",,,Chandler,,,
" It's like this, me, no jokes.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.",,,Chandler,,,
" Joey, no means no!",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim (sp?, I'm not an art guy) museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.",,,Chandler,,,
 (shyly) It means we're holding hands.,,,Chandler,,,
 I'm afraid I might just be.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.",,,Chandler,,,
 How do you not fall down more?,,,Chandler,,,
" All right. (reading her answer) ""My husband is sleeping with his secretary."" She's married! ",,,Chandler,,,
 I can't believe she's married.,,,Chandler,,,
 What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I'll do it!",,,Chandler,,,
" Where is she, Where is she? (grabs Rachel) Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?",,,Chandler,,,
" (noticing a beautiful blond walking in) Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God! (it's Janice),,,Chandler,,,
" Huh. (They all leave, dejected)",,,Chandler,,,
 Morning.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.",,,Chandler,,,
 I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.",,,Chandler,,,
" Nope, not this time.",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm not yanking you.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.",,,Chandler,,,
" (looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare at each other for a while, then Joey blows in his face)",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Of!,,,Chandler,,,
" You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?",,,Chandler,,,
" No, Janice.",,,Chandler,,,
" You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?",,,Chandler,,,
" Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, there you go.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters.",,,Chandler,,,
 I want you to say that you like her!,,,Chandler,,,
" Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!",,,Chandler,,,
" Umm, yeah.",,,Chandler,,,
" Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?",,,Chandler,,,
 We're not gonna talk about girth are we?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, okay.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah! All right! You go first.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Princess Leia in the gold bikini.,,,Chandler,,,
 I know!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.",,,Chandler,,,
" And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....",,,Chandler,,,
" I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!",,,Chandler,,,
 You said...,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you guys doing together?,,,Chandler,,,
 Really.,,,Chandler,,,
 You still can't stand her can you?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I guess that's something.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh God!,,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
 Taste it.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, mister tux!",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering from bathroom, with an issue of Cosmo) All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. (to Joey) Get up.",,,Chandler,,,
 You're in my seat.,,,Chandler,,,
 'Cause I was sitting there.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.",,,Chandler,,,
" The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. (yells at Joey) GET UP!!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up.",,,Chandler,,,
 Really!,,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.",,,Chandler,,,
" You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. (holds his hand a couple of inches in front of Joey's face) Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! (Joey flings some dip onto Phoebe's dress)",,,Chandler,,,
 Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. (sits on Joey's lap) I'm soooo, comfortable.",,,Chandler,,,
 All right! (jumps up),,,Chandler,,,
" All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! (leaves)",,,Chandler,,,
" Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, ""Get out of my chair, dillhole!""",,,Chandler,,,
 What are you doing?,,,Chandler,,,
 The cushions are the essence of the chair!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.",,,Chandler,,,
 We used them as pillows when we went camping.,,,Chandler,,,
 (shyly) The sheep.,,,Chandler,,,
 He took my essence!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.",,,Chandler,,,
" What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?",,,Chandler,,,
 He's got nothing!,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you supporting?,,,Chandler,,,
" Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Phoebe) You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?",,,Chandler,,,
" They got a phone in there, right?",,,Chandler,,,
 Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oooo-ooh!,,,Chandler,,,
" Jeez, what a baby.",,,Chandler,,,
 Stop it. Stop it!,,,Chandler,,,
 Excuse me. Hi.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.",,,Chandler,,,
" I mean, I was sitting there.",,,Chandler,,,
" But, I never left the room!",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, that's it, give me your underwear.",,,Chandler,,,
" (going to the bedroom) See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.",,,Chandler,,,
 Because the kids need new shoes.,,,Chandler,,,
 Do I look fat?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, so you both just know this stuff?",,,Chandler,,,
" That's easy, baggage claim.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.",,,Chandler,,,
 Thank you Rachel.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are),,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, the old hug and roll.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, one question.",,,Chandler,,,
 You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?,,,Chandler,,,
" Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.",,,Chandler,,,
" That, that's what's stupid.",,,Chandler,,,
" Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!' (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)",,,Chandler,,,
" No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.",,,Chandler,,,
 You mean there's more than one of us.,,,Chandler,,,
 And that's how you bought it?,,,Chandler,,,
" Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.",,,Chandler,,,

" Well, it's official there are no good movies.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, man. What's up?",,,Chandler,,,

" Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna",,,Chandler,,,
" I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life",,,Chandler,,,
 It doesn't scare me!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too",,,Chandler,,,
" So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship",,,Chandler,,,
 Then I got all needy and clingy.,,,Chandler,,,
 She said she'd call me.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh God.,,,Chandler,,,
 This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.,,,Chandler,,,
" So, you don't think I'm terminal?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, okay. So, should I call her?",,,Chandler,,,
" So I'm not, not gonna lose her?",,,Chandler,,,
" I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'",,,Chandler,,,
" (in a British accent) Hello, Janice.",,,Chandler,,,
" (in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?",,,Chandler,,,
 (normal voice) No. Not anymore.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as",,,Chandler,,,
 Here in Chelsea.,,,Chandler,,,
 A woman's,,,Chandler,,,

 Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah!,,,Chandler,,,
 You’re building a post office?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word! Those are snug.,,,Chandler,,,
 Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can’t get mad.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.",,,Chandler,,,
" I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.",,,Chandler,,,
 Peter Parker.,,,Chandler,,,
 (coughing) What a geek!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hi.,,,Chandler,,,
" We don’t, really.",,,Chandler,,,
" You know, we don’t really take advantage of living in the city.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, you didn’t get me!! It’s an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!",,,Chandler,,,
 I do NOT want this unit!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottom half of the door.)",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.",,,Chandler,,,
" Eh, y'know what, she’s to political, she probably wouldn’t let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she’s too international, y'know she’s never gonna be around.",,,Chandler,,,
" So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who’s gonna be in the country like all the time.",,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Have you seen Joey?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of his pants.) Y’know what it’s my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.",,,Chandler,,,
 What’s going on?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!,,,Chandler,,,
 He started mine first!,,,Chandler,,,
" What, like a number?",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi! Bye! (runs to the bathroom),,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, on three. One....Two....",,,Chandler,,,
 Why two?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this ‘two’ talk.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, one...two...",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, good job Joe.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how ‘bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move it, but it doesn’t move.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Umm?,,,Chandler,,,
 I’ve got five bucks says you can’t.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I think I have the cash.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so that the doors won’t open) I’m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack between the door and frame) Here you go.",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering, with a goatee) Hey.",,,Chandler,,,
" I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!",,,Chandler,,,
" Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’",,,Chandler,,,
" Umm, how’s it going with you guys?",,,Chandler,,,
" Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good. (Eric offers to shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)",,,Chandler,,,
" (running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door) Bye-bye.",,,Chandler,,,
 Sure. Ummm. What’s up?,,,Chandler,,,

" Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, Mon.",,,Chandler,,,

" Um-mm, yeah right!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yes, and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, but after that, we’re shootin’ some pool.",,,Chandler,,,
" Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.",,,Chandler,,,
 (picks it up) And now I’ve picked it up again. (walks over to Monica.),,,Chandler,,,

" Oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.",,,Chandler,,,
" So ah, whatcha watching?",,,Chandler,,,

 Wow! Look at them run.,,,Chandler,,,

" Well, hello!",,,Chandler,,,
 Do you have any beers? We’re out of beers.,,,Chandler,,,
 You okay?,,,Chandler,,,

" Noo!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t, I don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known in real life.",,,Chandler,,,
" Umm, this is nice.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?",,,Chandler,,,
" Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen, it’s, it’s gonna be....",,,Chandler,,,
" Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross. (they shake hands)",,,Chandler,,,
 I can’t believe you came back.,,,Chandler,,,
" If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Janice) Don’t look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!,,,Chandler,,,
 What a wank!,,,Chandler,,,
 (leaning in) I’ll go.,,,Chandler,,,
" See, that’s why I could never be an actor. Because I can’t say gig.",,,Chandler,,,
" Knock, knock.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, I’m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the bed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (to Monica) It’s a racecar.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, well it this bed isn’t new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?",,,Chandler,,,
 You told him to play the boxer gay!!,,,Chandler,,,
 You totally screwed him over.,,,Chandler,,,
" Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin’! (honks the bed’s little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops) All right, I’ll leave. My bed’s so boring.",,,Chandler,,,
 I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.),,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I’m not gonna have one.",,,Chandler,,,
 All right I’ll have one. (he and Ross take another,,,Chandler,,,
 See that is the problem with invisible dentists.,,,Chandler,,,
" That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think",,,Chandler,,,
" Janice’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her",,,Chandler,,,
" That’s a good idea, ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba",,,Chandler,,,
" All right. Look, I’m gonna go in here, and you don’t buy",,,Chandler,,,
 Why not?!,,,Chandler,,,
 What is the thing?,,,Chandler,,,
 (shocked) What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with me.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ah, I don’t know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna",,,Chandler,,,
" You tell me! Maybe, it’s because I was just fooling with",,,Chandler,,,
 All right!,,,Chandler,,,
" Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.",,,Chandler,,,
 No! In his office! How many kisses were there?,,,Chandler,,,
" Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!?",,,Chandler,,,
 (giving her a bag) Here.,,,Chandler,,,
" I’ll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 All right.,,,Chandler,,,
 I talked to Janice.,,,Chandler,,,
 She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I,,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?",,,Chandler,,,
" Come on, tell me.",,,Chandler,,,
 What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart,,,Chandler,,,
" Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you",,,Chandler,,,
 I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do.",,,Chandler,,,
 Then don’t leave me!,,,Chandler,,,
" Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!",,,Chandler,,,
" No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your",,,Chandler,,,
 Ohhh. Don’t go.,,,Chandler,,,
 No. No! No! No!,,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t care! (turns around and to the people watching,,,Chandler,,,
 You can’t leave! I have your shoe!,,,Chandler,,,
 (singing) ‘I’ll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe enters) I,,,Chandler,,,
 (high pitched) ‘No you know I don’t mind.’,,,Chandler,,,
 ‘I know.’,,,Chandler,,,
 ‘I’ve found.’,,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, no, I don’t, I don’t really wanna play.",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that I don’t have goals!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, all right, I’ll play.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, no, you say that proudly.",,,Chandler,,,
 And was the curse lifted?,,,Chandler,,,
" But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won’t let me cross the street.",,,Chandler,,,
 And then Tineals.,,,Chandler,,,
 Wow! Just like in the pros.,,,Chandler,,,
 The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but kicks Ross’s foot instead.),,,Chandler,,,
" Sorry. I’m sorry. Y'know what, we’re just gonna throw it.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.",,,Chandler,,,
" (coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts his hands between Ross’s legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and looks at him) You wanna go shotgun?",,,Chandler,,,
 (from the shotgun) Hike!,,,Chandler,,,
" Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, no, no, no!",,,Chandler,,,
" (running up) Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. (sees Marhan) Hi, I’m Chandler.",,,Chandler,,,
 Mar-haaaan.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, that went well.",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.",,,Chandler,,,
" Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.",,,Chandler,,,
" Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn’t I wouldn’t have a shot?",,,Chandler,,,
" Math!! You’re giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we’ll see who gets her.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey! Well, I’ve been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that’s mean!",,,Chandler,,,
 Before!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, good.",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Margha) Hi.,,,Chandler,,,
" No-no-no-no, the game’s not over, we’re just switching teams.",,,Chandler,,,
" No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?",,,Chandler,,,
" And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?",,,Chandler,,,
 Fine with me.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you don’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her.",,,Chandler,,,
" You hear that! That is her chose, mister I’ll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Wh-what?,,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know what, it doesn’t matter, ‘cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!",,,Chandler,,,
 We’re not gonna lose to girls.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you’re five feet short, so we win!",,,Chandler,,,
" Guys! Guys! Come on! It’s Thanksgiving, it’s not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.",,,Chandler,,,
" (reading the comics) Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?",,,Chandler,,,
 (thinks about it) Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
" Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.",,,Chandler,,,
 I was shrieking... like a Marine.,,,Chandler,,,
 (reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?,,,Chandler,,,
" Look out kids, he’s coming! (Ross continues to leave with his head down in shame.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it’s the only chance to see New York.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?",,,Chandler,,,
" How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?",,,Chandler,,,
" He’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.",,,Chandler,,,
" Because, I’m too afraid.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, that’d be much worse than being 28, and still working here.",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Joey) Does this mean we’re gonna have to start paying for coffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.),,,Chandler,,,
 I spelled out boobies.,,,Chandler,,,
" So, how many have you sold so far?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh my God, how did you do that?",,,Chandler,,,
 Me! On my computer.,,,Chandler,,,
" Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.",,,Chandler,,,
 Something else I might have said?,,,Chandler,,,
 You-you-you don’t wanna give into the fear.,,,Chandler,,,
" Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)",,,Chandler,,,
" Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Rachel, who’s entering) Hey! How’d the interview go?",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.",,,Chandler,,,
 It’s like ‘Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.’,,,Chandler,,,
" Sure, everybody loves a kidder.",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Ross) Should I tell her I ordered tea?,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m an alien. I’m an alien.,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?",,,Chandler,,,
 I just saw Janice.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, but you ended up having s*x with both of them that afternoon.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, y'know what, I’m gonna be okay, you don’t have to throw a party for me.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it’s supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hello-dillillio!!,,,Chandler,,,
 (to Monica) Take off your shirt!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi Joey’s sisters!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.",,,Chandler,,,
" No-no-no-no, no, it’s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can’t we savor the precious moments? (to one of Joey’s sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ow, no ‘woo-hooing,’ no ‘woo-hooing.’",,,Chandler,,,
" Ah, I fooled around with Joey’s sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well, that’s not the worst part.",,,Chandler,,,
 I can’t remember which sister.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?,,,Chandler,,,
" (to Monica) You see you can’t tell which one is which either, dwha!!",,,Chandler,,,
" Veronica. Look, it’s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, when I’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I’m sorry.",,,Chandler,,,
" Why can’t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.",,,Chandler,,,
 It’s gotta be the first one.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yep, I’m in a tree.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I’ll be in Cuba.",,,Chandler,,,
 What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?,,,Chandler,,,
" (shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?",,,Chandler,,,
 I’m here to see Mary-Angela.,,,Chandler,,,
 Where’s Mary-Angela?,,,Chandler,,,
" This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it’s, it’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?",,,Chandler,,,
" So um, Mary-Angela, what’s your second favorite?",,,Chandler,,,
 Would you just please....give me the receipt ‘cause this is great. It’s top notch.,,,Chandler,,,
 So will I.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything.,,,Chandler,,,
 Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall),,,Chandler,,,
 (startled) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ahhhh, you’re not Mary-Angela.",,,Chandler,,,
" This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, this is soo bad. (doesn’t see Mary-Angela)",,,Chandler,,,
 No Joey! No Joey! Don’t Joey! Joey!,,,Chandler,,,
 (pats him on the shoulder) You’re it! Now run and hide!,,,Chandler,,,
" I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey’s sisters gasp) Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?",,,Chandler,,,
" Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, absolutely!",,,Chandler,,,
" You’ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister’s, but he still doesn’t know which one is Mary-Angela.)",,,Chandler,,,
 What?! (Cookie punches him),,,Chandler,,,
 Don’t worry.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?",,,Chandler,,,
" I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?,,,Chandler,,,
 (to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys.,,,Chandler,,,
" (to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday?",,,Chandler,,,
 Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.",,,Chandler,,,
 Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! (pause) Don't cry outloud.,,,Chandler,,,
" I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.",,,Chandler,,,
 I'll get you the Cliff Notes.,,,Chandler,,,
 The abridgment.,,,Chandler,,,
 ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no, no, no, no.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, I have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) Hello? (listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. (listens) Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? (listens) So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.",,,Chandler,,,
" To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.",,,Chandler,,,
 Bye-bye.,,,Chandler,,,
" What, what, what?!",,,Chandler,,,
 You really think that is what he meant?,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'",,,Chandler,,,
 He paints quite a picture doesn't he?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See, she's fully dressed, right?",,,Chandler,,,
" And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! (Rachel just stares at him.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some p0rn?",,,Chandler,,,
" Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, baby!",,,Chandler,,,
 Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, hey.",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Robert) So ah, isn’t a bit cold out for shorts?",,,Chandler,,,
" Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.",,,Chandler,,,
" (standing up) I’m up! I’m up, I’ve gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay Ross, why don’t you come with me?",,,Chandler,,,
 Robert’s coming out.,,,Chandler,,,
 No. He.....he’s coming out of his shorts.,,,Chandler,,,
 The man is showing brain.,,,Chandler,,,
 (to Ross) Wellll?,,,Chandler,,,
 What do we do? What do we do?,,,Chandler,,,
 Like an eclipse.,,,Chandler,,,
" Your liking it, huh?",,,Chandler,,,
" No, actually Laurie’s a boy.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 You mean a three pointer?,,,Chandler,,,
" I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it just seems that Robert isn’t as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.",,,Chandler,,,
" Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!",,,Chandler,,,
" Hmmm, that’s very cool.",,,Chandler,,,
 I can’t believe she cracked your code!,,,Chandler,,,
" No, Beth doesn’t die, she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?",,,Chandler,,,
" We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, we got, um-hmm.",,,Chandler,,,
 I like her.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these people.",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Ross) All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I’d like know whether that’s several big fish or just one big fish.",,,Chandler,,,
 No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’,,,Chandler,,,
" Jeez, man did you fall..(sees it’s a beautiful woman coming out of the men’s room) Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I’m-I’m talking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you say your name.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger, so....",,,Chandler,,,
" Nope, nope, I’d just ah, I’d rather talk to you. (pause) Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve ever met in a men’s room.",,,Chandler,,,
" (sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, really you’re gonna freeze.",,,Chandler,,,
" You’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.",,,Chandler,,,
" Great. It was great. She’s ah, she’s great, great looking, great personality, she’s greatness.",,,Chandler,,,
" Joey told you about the leg, huh?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn’t have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it’s like ‘Hey, y'know what, where’s your leg?’ I mean I’m the smallest person in the world aren’t I? I’m the smallest person in the world.",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Monica) Actually he’s the smallest person in the world.,,,Chandler,,,
 It came up.,,,Chandler,,,
" No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?",,,Chandler,,,
 No. No. I don’t think so.,,,Chandler,,,
 That’s-that’s my nubbin.,,,Chandler,,,
" It’s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... (starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?",,,Chandler,,,
" You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering, happily) Well hello!",,,Chandler,,,
 The doctor.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.",,,Chandler,,,
" That was an obvious joke, and I didn’t think of it. Why didn’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I’m going down to the Xerox place.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah! You wanna come?,,,Chandler,,,
 Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Uh-oh.,,,Chandler,,,
" (to Joey) Okay, that hurt us.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well ah, ........y'know.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, rock on. (Does the ‘Hang 10’ sign, then hides his face in shame.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?",,,Chandler,,,
 What time is it now?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah all right, so we’ll hang out.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes. Vividly.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah, I-I think so...",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?",,,Chandler,,,
 She was kidding.,,,Chandler,,,
" She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab something with his hand.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well it you don’t know that, then I don’t want to do this with you.",,,Chandler,,,
 And that’s the only colour that comes in.,,,Chandler,,,
" So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",,,Chandler,,,
 Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.,,,Chandler,,,
 Why? What happened to him?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God! Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?",,,Chandler,,,
" He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!",,,Chandler,,,
 Off?!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, that’s mature.",,,Chandler,,,
" Nothing, nothing.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Joey) He has s*x, and we get hit in our heads.",,,Chandler,,,
 Uh-oh.,,,Chandler,,,
 She was not good. Not good.,,,Chandler,,,
 Uh-oh.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.",,,Chandler,,,
" (handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, we’re never leaving, ever.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh great, food with hair on it.",,,Chandler,,,
 Because that would be crazy?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you actually saying these words?,,,Chandler,,,
 Let’s go.,,,Chandler,,,
 (to Joey) Is that your new walk?,,,Chandler,,,
 This is the New York Times.,,,Chandler,,,
 We are. He’s meeting us here.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, I mean it’s been a week.",,,Chandler,,,
 No.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, yes, it’s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, he’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.",,,Chandler,,,
 (jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I’m, I’m smoking still.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeahhh. I’m tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh that’s great, with my luck, that’s gonna be him.",,,Chandler,,,
" Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and it’s Rachel again.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, shut up!! You’re not my real Mom!!",,,Chandler,,,
 Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Joey) Well he’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Beam me up Jesus.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, come on, there’s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.",,,Chandler,,,
" Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Joey) My lighter’s in there! (points to the cab),,,Chandler,,,
 Damn! (stands up) The tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica’s bra.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, now let’s decide who has the nicest ass.",,,Chandler,,,
 At least let me smoke it to the good part.,,,Chandler,,,
 I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.),,,Chandler,,,
 Well it’s very unsettling.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no, now it’s not gonna make any sense!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, this is horrible, it’s just horrible.",,,Chandler,,,
 It’s horrible.,,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know what, I can handle it, handle’s my middle name. Actually it’s the ah, middle part of my first name.",,,Chandler,,,
" Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to stop the fighting.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" No-no, why don’t you hang on to that one.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, that’s like the least fun game ever.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake laughs.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Or what my Father called Thursday night.,,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, I would’ve bet good money that he’d be the first one of us to get married.",,,Chandler,,,
 Always illegal Joe.,,,Chandler,,,
" If that doesn’t keep kids in school, what will?",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi.",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know what, pretty good.",,,Chandler,,,
" Good! I haven’t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.",,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks,,,Chandler,,,
 What check thing?,,,Chandler,,,
 (reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete… (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?,,,Chandler,,,
 Who’s he huggin’?,,,Chandler,,,
 This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!,,,Chandler,,,
 There you go!!,,,Chandler,,,
 (to the girls who are staring at him) What?,,,Chandler,,,
 (in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around),,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, then get the lobster!",,,Chandler,,,
" Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.",,,Chandler,,,
 Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?,,,Chandler,,,
 Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.",,,Chandler,,,
" It’s possible. You are very loveable, I’d miss you if I broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.",,,Chandler,,,
" (in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I’d miss you.",,,Chandler,,,
 And you’re our age. You’re our age.,,,Chandler,,,
 That’s not a state Joe.,,,Chandler,,,
 You’re our age!,,,Chandler,,,
" I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?",,,Chandler,,,
 Is there any chance you didn’t see that?,,,Chandler,,,
 Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!,,,Chandler,,,
 You didn’t just break up.,,,Chandler,,,
 You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.,,,Chandler,,,
 Stop what?!,,,Chandler,,,
 No!! You can’t!!,,,Chandler,,,
" I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! (Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly strong!",,,Chandler,,,
 Look man!,,,Chandler,,,
 Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.),,,Chandler,,,
" She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It’s over.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 I know. (He rubs Ross’s head),,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. (He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a gunfighter in a Western.)",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Joey) I wasn’t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?",,,Chandler,,,
" Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.",,,Chandler,,,
 I think somebody has a crush on somebody.,,,Chandler,,,
" I’m talking about you. You big, big freak.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!",,,Chandler,,,
 ‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man.",,,Chandler,,,
" So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?",,,Chandler,,,
 What about things that are already gold?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, let’s play my game now.",,,Chandler,,,
" Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!",,,Chandler,,,
 My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, that’s-that’s okay, no problem. (He starts to look around her office.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, I realise that.",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s the stuff! (quickly grabs it),,,Chandler,,,
" Thanks, it’s ah, Gaelic, for ‘Thy turkey’s done.’ So ah, I’m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hello.,,,Chandler,,,
 (holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin’ out the Chan-Chan man!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I’ll do it.",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Hey, my Father’s house does that!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.",,,Chandler,,,
" Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna’s such a big, dull dud!",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering with Rachel) I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime. I’ll give you a call.’",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s what you say at the end of a date.,,,Chandler,,,
" To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.",,,Chandler,,,
" Multiple, so many paper cuts.",,,Chandler,,,
" (sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’",,,Chandler,,,
 Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!,,,Chandler,,,
" All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!",,,Chandler,,,
" That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know.",,,Chandler,,,
" It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here, (points to his eye) and it’s all the time.",,,Chandler,,,
" (He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was pleasant.",,,Chandler,,,
" The food there was, was great.",,,Chandler,,,
 So take care.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime. (Rachel is disappointed)",,,Chandler,,,
 Noo!,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.",,,Chandler,,,
 Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you.,,,Chandler,,,
" I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I was going to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, o-okay.",,,Chandler,,,
 Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!,,,Chandler,,,
 (sporting a goatee) Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 No way!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. (they start to leave),,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.),,,Chandler,,,
" So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (He opens it and it’s a baby chick) It’s a chicken.,,,Chandler,,,
 Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.,,,Chandler,,,
 Easy Lenny.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 She?,,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over,",,,Chandler,,,
 Excuse me?,,,Chandler,,,
 I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so,,,Chandler,,,
 You don’t think I get up when you get up?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you",,,Chandler,,,
 And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?,,,Chandler,,,
 I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since,,,Chandler,,,
 I’ll take her back tomorrow.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" (rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a",,,Chandler,,,
" I know. See, yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took,,,Chandler,,,
" If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of,,,Chandler,,,
" Thanks, I’m glad you see it that way.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ohhh-hoo, funny story!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you",,,Chandler,,,
" That’s a bad duck!!! (to Ross) How’d the thing go tonight,",,,Chandler,,,
" (to the duck) Okay, now when you come back I hope you",,,Chandler,,,
 (coming out of his apartment and seeing Ross) What did you,,,Chandler,,,
 Having a swim.,,,Chandler,,,
 Chicks don’t swim.,,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t know. Should we try it?,,,Chandler,,,
" See, I told you they don’t swim. (He goes to take it out)",,,Chandler,,,
" Noo! (takes him out) Oh, it’s okay, it’s okay, baby, baby,",,,Chandler,,,
 Ye-e-es!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Who’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.,,,Chandler,,,
 Bye!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, and I don’t have any cologne.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering, carrying the chick and duck) Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.,,,Chandler,,,
 (seeing Joey) There he is!,,,Chandler,,,
 Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.,,,Chandler,,,
 I know.,,,Chandler,,,
 So that’s the girl you like.,,,Chandler,,,
" Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don’t like the guy Rachel’s dating? Well, that’s odd.",,,Chandler,,,
 Could I borrow it?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh-ho-ho-ho.,,,Chandler,,,
 7:15. (Monica looks at him) Watch doesn’t work.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, (claps his hands) banging his hands together!",,,Chandler,,,
" Ross, don’t. Ross!",,,Chandler,,,
" Ohh, that’s a good one.",,,Chandler,,,
" Why don’t you use ours across the hall, ‘cause she…has…problems.",,,Chandler,,,
 Step away from the duck.,,,Chandler,,,
" And yet, she’s still not hanging up the phone.",,,Chandler,,,
 Or... Dick.,,,Chandler,,,
 Was it like a sneeze only better?,,,Chandler,,,
 No!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) Huh.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a…",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.",,,Chandler,,,
" You're right, I know.",,,Chandler,,,
" (joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well sensitive is important, pick him.",,,Chandler,,,
 (sitting down on the couch) I-kea! This is comfortable.,,,Chandler,,,
" So, what do you thing the good news is?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, so you’re going with the teacher, huh?",,,Chandler,,,
" (comforting the duck) Everything’s gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?",,,Chandler,,,
" Do you think that there’s a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you’re driving into town there’s-there’s like a sign, and it says “You’re in Sample.” (He says it like urine sample.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re are no rules.”",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, but there’s two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh it’s Bing, sir. I’m sorry , I was just ah...",,,Chandler,,,
" All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)",,,Chandler,,,
" Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between ‘em.",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?,,,Chandler,,,
 (to his co-workers) What is with him?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once.",,,Chandler,,,
 No sir.,,,Chandler,,,
 (joining them) Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?,,,Chandler,,,
" Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.",,,Chandler,,,
" Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!",,,Chandler,,,
" No, I ah, I didn’t do them.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.",,,Chandler,,,
 Doug!!,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (he starts to leave),,,Chandler,,,
" Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)",,,Chandler,,,
" Thank you, sir.",,,Chandler,,,
" No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!",,,Chandler,,,
" Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a",,,Chandler,,,
" Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.)",,,Chandler,,,
" (reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe,",,,Chandler,,,
" You’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I’ll be your",,,Chandler,,,
 Why is that so funny?,,,Chandler,,,
" Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. But",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat!",,,Chandler,,,
" Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?",,,Chandler,,,
 Big bullies!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Bored and bored!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.",,,Chandler,,,
" So, you still don’t think I’m boyfriend material?",,,Chandler,,,
 I saw you checking me out during the game last night.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well, lucky for you.",,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t know.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah, I don’t know what they were doing, but at one",,,Chandler,,,
 Where ya going?,,,Chandler,,,
" (to Joey) Noo!! I don’t care! I’m not, I’m not gonna playing",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don’t need",,,Chandler,,,
 Ahhhh! (Steps away from her.),,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.",,,Chandler,,,
 There is not one hair on that head.,,,Chandler,,,
 (in a fake voice) Hi there.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you’re gonna wanna date",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi! I’m Dorf! You’re date for the evening. (Monica walks,,,Chandler,,,
 (to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away in disgust),,,Chandler,,,
" (jumping up) Oh, I’ll go out and get you some.",,,Chandler,,,
" Nope! Because I’m not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, who’s entering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?",,,Chandler,,,
 I found a dried up seashores.,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?",,,Chandler,,,
 I’ve got canned goods.,,,Chandler,,,
" Excellent hole, Joe.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!",,,Chandler,,,
 We’ve got to do something!,,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know what, he’s right. There’s something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.",,,Chandler,,,
 Me too!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I’m gonna break up with you!",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.",,,Chandler,,,
 (jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!,,,Chandler,,,
 I’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.,,,Chandler,,,
 (running over and joining Monica) They’ll never understand!,,,Chandler,,,
 (following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn’t think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica’s shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.),,,Chandler,,,
 And then Joey remembered something.,,,Chandler,,,
" (wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, “Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!” Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.",,,Chandler,,,
 (entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?,,,Chandler,,,
 I KNEW IT!!!!,,,Chandler,,,
" We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. All right.,,,Chandler,,,
 Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!,,,Chandler,,,
" You don’t turn and slide, you throw it out! I’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, how about we, how ‘bout we sell it.",,,Chandler,,,
 (nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to Joey) They seem all right with it!,,,Chandler,,,
" Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.",,,Chandler,,,
" (reading the ad) Stunning entertainment center. Fine, (pause) fine Italian craftsmanship. (Joey is very proud of himself)",,,Chandler,,,
 You want it?,,,Chandler,,,
" Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?",,,Chandler,,,
" All right look, I’m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.",,,Chandler,,,
 (looks at him) Nooo.,,,Chandler,,,
 I can’t believe you don’t know what I do for a living!,,,Chandler,,,
 (interrupting) Let it go!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.",,,Chandler,,,
" You’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he’s wrong.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh-no, he’s right.",,,Chandler,,,
 I’m coming already!!,,,Chandler,,,
 OH MY GOD!!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you all right?!,,,Chandler,,,
 (lets him out) What happened?!!,,,Chandler,,,
 What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!,,,Chandler,,,
 So--You got in voluntarily?!,,,Chandler,,,
 BEND OVER?!!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, they said uh, “You don’t have insurance here, so stop calling us.”",,,Chandler,,,
" Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we’d really appreciate it. (Joey nods in agreement)",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away!",,,Chandler,,,
 Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Could we be more white trash?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.",,,Chandler,,,
 (laughs) No. No!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, not at first.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I promise, I’ll end it.",,,Chandler,,,
" I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.",,,Chandler,,,
" …it was like the Algonquin kids table. (They all laugh, but Joey only laughs not to be left out.)",,,Chandler,,,
 It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (Starts to button up his shirt),,,Chandler,,,
 I’m getting dressed.,,,Chandler,,,
 When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.,,,Chandler,,,
 What is it?,,,Chandler,,,
" Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me. (She kisses him) Yeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy.",,,Chandler,,,
" You are, you’re gonna leave me like this?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay. But if you don’t come back soon, (She leaves and closes the door) there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi! (to Sophie) How are you?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hello, Joanna…(Realises he doesn’t know her last name)…’s office.",,,Chandler,,,
 How little?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!",,,Chandler,,,
 Why not?!,,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
" (in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see you for a moment?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.",,,Chandler,,,
" I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!",,,Chandler,,,
" It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.",,,Chandler,,,
" No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and (Stops and looks up the skirt on a statue behind Joanna’s desk.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Never!,,,Chandler,,,
 Fine!,,,Chandler,,,
 I—never borrowed your Walkman.,,,Chandler,,,
 You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goes over and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist),,,Chandler,,,
" No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!",,,Chandler,,,
 About what?,,,Chandler,,,
" I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, this is much better.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.",,,Chandler,,,
" It still wouldn’t be clean. (Rachel makes an ‘Eww, disgusting!’ face) All I want is my freedom.",,,Chandler,,,
 Freedom!,,,Chandler,,,
" Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?! (Opens the door) Sophie, help me! Help me!! (Sophie stands up)",,,Chandler,,,
" I’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just… (He moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head, which proves his point.)",,,Chandler,,,
 No!,,,Chandler,,,
 With extra pulp?,,,Chandler,,,
 No!,,,Chandler,,,
 You don’t have it.,,,Chandler,,,
 How do Monica and Phoebe know?,,,Chandler,,,
 (intrigued) Go on.,,,Chandler,,,
 And Milton Berle has a…,,,Chandler,,,
 (hello) Hello.,,,Chandler,,,
 (to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead),,,Chandler,,,
" (checks his watch) Two hours, that lasted!",,,Chandler,,,
 I think so.,,,Chandler,,,
 Could there be more Kims?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn’t say ‘cool’ anymore.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times.",,,Chandler,,,
" You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.",,,Chandler,,,
 No!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no, you’ll have to come.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?,,,Chandler,,,
 Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on the table!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!,,,Chandler,,,
 No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.,,,Chandler,,,
 I wanna quit the gym.,,,Chandler,,,
 (He turns to Ross and Ross makes a ‘Be strong’ sound.) I wanna quit the gym.,,,Chandler,,,
 (horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about himself) I wanna quit the gym.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, I almost did, couldn’t leave Ross there without a spotter!",,,Chandler,,,
" We’re doomed. Okay, they’re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?",,,Chandler,,,
 You’re a genius!,,,Chandler,,,
" Now, there’s two reasons.",,,Chandler,,,
" Thank you, Joey.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, we’d just like to close them.",,,Chandler,,,
 I wanna quit the bank!,,,Chandler,,,
 To pay for the gym.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah… Bunny-rabbit.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.",,,Chandler,,,
 I could die.,,,Chandler,,,
 I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! (Phoebe sneezes),,,Chandler,,,
" All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?",,,Chandler,,,
 (gets up) (softly) Wish me luck.,,,Chandler,,,
" Wish it! (To the woman, Kathy, he likes) Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh Kathy, with K or a C?",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh-oh-hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. (Joey kisses Kathy.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.",,,Chandler,,,
 (sees Kathy is up watching TV) Hi!,,,Chandler,,,
" Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God! That's why I got up too!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...",,,Chandler,,,
" So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.",,,Chandler,,,
" That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.",,,Chandler,,,
 Is it on?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! (Runs over and gets his wonder broom),,,Chandler,,,
 Oh! It's on! It's on!,,,Chandler,,,
 There we go little fella.,,,Chandler,,,
 Well the duck can swim.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.",,,Chandler,,,
" She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?",,,Chandler,,,
" No, I don't.",,,Chandler,,,
" Thank you, Ross.",,,Chandler,,,
 All right.,,,Chandler,,,
 All right.,,,Chandler,,,
" Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps running, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to The Mod Squad starts to play. First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a hot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs, in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes the chase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. He gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of cabs.) Kathy! (He jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) Kathy.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I just wanted to say, ""Hey!""",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (He walks away disgusted with himself.),,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.,,,Chandler,,,
" I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he waits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!",,,Chandler,,,
 Really?!,,,Chandler,,,
 (laughs) Right in there!,,,Chandler,,,
" 99...100! Ready or not, here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees that the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right, let's go over the concept one more time.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.",,,Chandler,,,
 You-you do?,,,Chandler,,,
 You got me.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. Right.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.",,,Chandler,,,
 Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.,,,Chandler,,,
" Uhh, no-no thanks.",,,Chandler,,,
" Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, look, what do you want from me?",,,Chandler,,,
 I am pretending.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? (Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!",,,Chandler,,,
 Can I sleep on your couch?,,,Chandler,,,
 Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.,,,Chandler,,,
" Where did you, when did you, how did you... (Joey hits the back of Chandler's head) How did you get a girl like that?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?,,,Chandler,,,
" Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I have a call in about that.",,,Chandler,,,
" Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.",,,Chandler,,,
 It doesn't say that. Does it?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.",,,Chandler,,,
" It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into the bathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?",,,Chandler,,,
 (confused) Sure...,,,Chandler,,,
" I don't know... um, Grease?",,,Chandler,,,
 Rent?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, so when do you want to go?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, it is, at Office Max.",,,Chandler,,,
 A pen.,,,Chandler,,,
 Huh-huh! You can't give her that.,,,Chandler,,,
 Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?",,,Chandler,,,
 For three years?,,,Chandler,,,
" All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?",,,Chandler,,,
 Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called ""Invisible things for Kathy."" (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?",,,Chandler,,,
" She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?,,,Chandler,,,
 Where?,,,Chandler,,,
" I got something for her. (Joey picks up the package, shakes it next to his ear, can't hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) It's a book!",,,Chandler,,,
" No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?",,,Chandler,,,
" No, it came out to an even twenty.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yeah? That's great!,,,Chandler,,,
" [nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh....",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! Happy birthday.,,,Chandler,,,
 No he didn't. [Moving it back.],,,Chandler,,,
 Happy birthday! I'm sorry.,,,Chandler,,,
" See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah... yeah.",,,Chandler,,,
 [to Kathy] Goodnight.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, the book?",,,Chandler,,,
 What do you mean?,,,Chandler,,,
" (tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, ""Uhl, ell.""",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.",,,Chandler,,,
 Goodnight. (Goes to his room.),,,Chandler,,,
 (entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!,,,Chandler,,,
" It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she’s smooth! Smooth! (leaves)",,,Chandler,,,
 (rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?,,,Chandler,,,
" Goin’ out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So things didn’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.",,,Chandler,,,
 (shocked) What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having s*x with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can’t believe he just sad that.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right! Bring it on, you…",,,Chandler,,,
 (interrupting) Oh my God! Play!,,,Chandler,,,
" Really, bitchin’!",,,Chandler,,,
" You mean like, music?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I know what you’re thinkin’! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.",,,Chandler,,,
 Come in!,,,Chandler,,,
" Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.",,,Chandler,,,
" No-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?",,,Chandler,,,
" I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) …of the boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.",,,Chandler,,,
 What happened?,,,Chandler,,,
 Why can’t you tell her?,,,Chandler,,,
 Joey! Joey!!,,,Chandler,,,
 I thought your time ran out.,,,Chandler,,,
" (to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. He’s running a little late, he says he’s sorry.",,,Chandler,,,
" So I guess it’s just uh, you and me then.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I think it is!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut…",,,Chandler,,,
 …and then it got canceled.,,,Chandler,,,
 Really?! You do that?,,,Chandler,,,
" Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don’t make my tail too poofy.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Y’know who also has great hair is Joey!",,,Chandler,,,
 What-what ‘cha doin’?,,,Chandler,,,
 ‘Kay.,,,Chandler,,,
 (jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phone’s making sounds! (On phone) Hello!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey it’s Joey!,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.),,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. Yes! Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh.,,,Chandler,,,
" No-no-no-no, this is bad! It’s bad! This is bad!",,,Chandler,,,
" Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay!,,,Chandler,,,
" Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do, we-we forget it happened.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappy forever. Sound good?",,,Chandler,,,
" I have to; he’s my best friend, and you’re seeing him.",,,Chandler,,,
" (interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Don’t! Don’t! See-see, you’re getting me confused, I’m starting to urn.",,,Chandler,,,
 I-I think we have too.,,,Chandler,,,
 Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against the door.) Are you still out there?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment.),,,Chandler,,,
 I sure did.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the TV.),,,Chandler,,,
" Well, y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I don’t know.",,,Chandler,,,
 You mean with Casey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Or Casey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Could be Casey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Consider Casey.,,,Chandler,,,
 That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!,,,Chandler,,,
 I kissed Kathy.,,,Chandler,,,
" No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he’ll understand this?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is it?",,,Chandler,,,
 Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!,,,Chandler,,,
 God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I know.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Is that a real thing?,,,Chandler,,,
" Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.",,,Chandler,,,
" It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh uh, when?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.",,,Chandler,,,
" See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.",,,Chandler,,,
 It’s me. I’m the other guy.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…",,,Chandler,,,
 No! No! No! I just kissed her.,,,Chandler,,,
 How is that worse?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I think I’m in love with her!",,,Chandler,,,
" You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!,,,Chandler,,,
 Probably because…,,,Chandler,,,
" (on phone) Hey, it’s me. I know you can’t stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone. All I… (Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I’m… (Joey hangs up the phone again.)",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!",,,Chandler,,,
" They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, ‘cause I wanna trade for her.",,,Chandler,,,
 Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it… (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe’s faces.) Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it… (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials…",,,Chandler,,,
" Op, y'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!",,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks.,,,Chandler,,,
" Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.",,,Chandler,,,
 Well maybe you should put some ice on it.,,,Chandler,,,
 He’s really picky about his patients.,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.",,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.",,,Chandler,,,
 Like?,,,Chandler,,,
 When was the last time you saw her wear it?,,,Chandler,,,
 Big dog?,,,Chandler,,,
" I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Joe.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! I’m sorry! That—(sees that Joey is about to leave) where are you going?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?",,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!",,,Chandler,,,
" All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?",,,Chandler,,,
" (He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad idea to me.",,,Chandler,,,
" The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a third finger), it hurts!",,,Chandler,,,
 Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.),,,Chandler,,,
 How do ya do.,,,Chandler,,,
 What happened? What happened?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Gotcha! (laughs),,,Chandler,,,
 Sorry!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, okay, you got it!",,,Chandler,,,
" You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!",,,Chandler,,,
" You’re right, and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won’t say another word tonight.",,,Chandler,,,
 Absolutely!,,,Chandler,,,
 So?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
" Man, this is…",,,Chandler,,,
 Our eyes are closed and we’re about to cross the street. Very good.,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?",,,Chandler,,,
" No-no, I don’t think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!",,,Chandler,,,
" Kathy’s with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!",,,Chandler,,,
 I’m gonna call and get off work tomorrow!,,,Chandler,,,
" This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh man! I am so excited—I may vomit!,,,Chandler,,,
" Look you don’t understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y’know you’re never know what’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, it’s beautiful country up there.",,,Chandler,,,
 It’s not gonna be exactly like last time.,,,Chandler,,,
 Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!,,,Chandler,,,
" (answering it) Hello. (listens) (to Ross) It’s Gandolf!!! (on phone) So, are you in town? (listens) (disappointed) Oh, well, well maybe next time then. (Hangs up)",,,Chandler,,,
" He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.",,,Chandler,,,
" Stupid, useless Canadian money!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh-no, y’know with Gandolf we’d be out all night!",,,Chandler,,,
 And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?,,,Chandler,,,
 All right!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, those were seals, man.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, all right.",,,Chandler,,,
" Actually, me too.",,,Chandler,,,
" Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?",,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re just not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?",,,Chandler,,,
 Were you so late because you were burring this woman?,,,Chandler,,,
" How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they all look at him) That joke would’ve killed in Albany.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) They’re lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it.",,,Chandler,,,
 Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.",,,Chandler,,,
 (he glares at him for a while) Yes.,,,Chandler,,,
" I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him) Og-ee-op, I’m not asking for me, I’m… I mean… No, I’m-I’m not gay, I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!",,,Chandler,,,
" See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I don’t really know what that is, but let’s!!",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Hello, children!",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They’re buying me drinks! They’re giving me stuff! (to Joey) Knicks tonight?",,,Chandler,,,
 Wherever! I’ve got like 20!,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know what, I’m gonna uh, play the field just a little more.",,,Chandler,,,
 Guys are signing over their 401-K’s to me?,,,Chandler,,,
" (pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay, there’s this one guy, Patrick, I think you’re gonna like him, he’s really nice, he’s funny, he’s a swimmer.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.",,,Chandler,,,
" See, I’m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.",,,Chandler,,,
" It’s a big company, I don’t—if you—I…",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yeah! With who?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, man!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, like father, like son.",,,Chandler,,,
 Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ummmmmmmm, no.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see.,,,Chandler,,,
" (interrupting) Oh, y’know, y’know what Pheebs?",,,Chandler,,,
" I’m not Jewish, so…",,,Chandler,,,
 Bad dream?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe’s song about?",,,Chandler,,,
 Prague?,,,Chandler,,,
 I did! I absolutely did!,,,Chandler,,,
" I’m sure you’re right, but why?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry.",,,Chandler,,,
 I know! I know!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, y’know, you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody! You’re a great catch! Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn’t have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, it doesn’t matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey, y’know what, I’ve got two tickets to tonight’s Rangers game, you wanna come with me?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, actually it’s a hockey team, so it’s angry Canadians with no teeth.",,,Chandler,,,
 Have you ever been with a woman?,,,Chandler,,,
 So there is no good time to ask that question.,,,Chandler,,,
" I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black. [stops]",,,Chandler,,,
" Blue blazer *back*. He, he wants it *back*.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you, you know what I meant.",,,Chandler,,,
 [Chandler glares at her and then changes the subject.] So what job did you get Joe?,,,Chandler,,,
 You're going to carry their child and get them a Sony Play Station?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway. It came with the pants.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes. Right where?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, you've, you've got to love the talking.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, we haven't had s*x yet. Okay, but what's the big deal, you know? This is special, and I want our love to grow, before we move to the next level.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, he's right, I'm totally lying.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, Kathy's last girlfriend was Joey.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes and I was saying the actual words.,,,Chandler,,,
 We share a wall. So either he's great in bed or she just liked to agree with him a lot.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
" [gets up to leave] All right, all right, I'll sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys. [leaves]",,,Chandler,,,
 [enters] Hey. Why's Phoebe singing to Karl Malden?,,,Chandler,,,
" [dejectedly] Yes, yes, we had the s*x.",,,Chandler,,,
" It was fine, you know, but she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, uh, ""Oh, I see your point. I'm all right with it.""",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, you have to help me, okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman. I know where everything goes. It's always...nice. But I need to know what makes it go from ""nice"" to ""My God, somebody's killing her in there!""",,,Chandler,,,
" You don't have to draw an actual wo -- [looks at Monica's drawing] Woah, she' hot.",,,Chandler,,,
 [shocked] There are seven?,,,Chandler,,,
 [points to diagram] That's one?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, you know what, I was looking at it upside down.",,,Chandler,,,
 And that's bad?,,,Chandler,,,
 Well you might if it were anything like seven.,,,Chandler,,,
 You!,,,Chandler,,,
 Well the vet seems to think that’s she’s becoming a rooster. (The rooster crows.) We’re getting a second opinion.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.",,,Chandler,,,
 I can check that for ya.,,,Chandler,,,
 Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.,,,Chandler,,,
" (to Rachel) And you… Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Ross) Stop that now!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes!,,,Chandler,,,
 Diet soda.,,,Chandler,,,
 Orange juice.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! (Whispers something in Joey’s ear.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I got it! Scotch… tape. (They’re right.),,,Chandler,,,
" Well, we used there’s up last night making scary faces.",,,Chandler,,,
 All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.,,,Chandler,,,
 Fears and Pet Peeves.,,,Chandler,,,
 His legs flail about as if independent of his body!,,,Chandler,,,
 She has a real name.,,,Chandler,,,
 Althea?! What are you doing?!,,,Chandler,,,
 You're shooting with Althea?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Nice shooting!,,,Chandler,,,
" Actually, it’s Miss Chinandolor Bong.",,,Chandler,,,
 Unfortunately that is correct.,,,Chandler,,,
" I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we’re gonna destroy you.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I’m so confused as to what we’ve been doing so far…",,,Chandler,,,
 Say 200?,,,Chandler,,,
" (interrupting) All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.",,,Chandler,,,
" But if we win, we get your apartment.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (Starts jumping around.),,,Chandler,,,
 Dangerous Liaisons.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh! (Whispers something in Joey’s ear and then in Ross’s ear.),,,Chandler,,,
 Fancy.,,,Chandler,,,
 Fancy guest.,,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks man.,,,Chandler,,,
 You can’t just call Monica’s room.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It’s too nice.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, but I bet it works.",,,Chandler,,,
 Well believe it baby!,,,Chandler,,,
 I knew it!,,,Chandler,,,
" Cool, girl roommate.",,,Chandler,,,
 Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!,,,Chandler,,,
 What?! What-what is it?!,,,Chandler,,,
 I can’t believe we live here!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have s*x with the star of the play!",,,Chandler,,,
 I know!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?,,,Chandler,,,
" Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!",,,Chandler,,,
" I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like, ""So where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?"" And she’ll go, ""No-no-no, it’s Chandler."" And he’ll go, ""Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!""",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?",,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
" So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I know but…",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.",,,Chandler,,,
" I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!",,,Chandler,,,
" Come on, it was like cousins having s*x up there!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having s*x with him.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!",,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you can understand, given how we started.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!",,,Chandler,,,
 Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at the new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind their backs. Chandler wonders into the girl’s apartment.) You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!,,,Chandler,,,
" I confronted her, and she didn’t deny it! (Pause) I don’t live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie’s…",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes! See you and I have always been like—(motions that they think the same.),,,Chandler,,,
 Did she call?,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, maybe I should call her.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?",,,Chandler,,,
" She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!",,,Chandler,,,
" That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry. Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y’know, I know for me—(Notices a pair of men’s pants on the chair.) Nick’s pants?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him.",,,Chandler,,,
 She is now.,,,Chandler,,,
" I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.",,,Chandler,,,
" Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!",,,Chandler,,,
" You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here. Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandler goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)",,,Chandler,,,
 (opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would you give me one minute!! Please.,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know, I can’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I’m never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers.,,,Chandler,,,
 They got a breakfast buffet.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ooh, let me talk to him!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, can I just…",,,Chandler,,,
 She’s shhing me! It’s my phone and she’s shhing me!,,,Chandler,,,
 Ow!,,,Chandler,,,
" Maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I’m going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into the living room.)",,,Chandler,,,
" So y’know, uh, when’s he getting back?",,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know, I knew something like this was going to happen. (He starts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes you can. You’re thinking about time, you can’t go back in time.",,,Chandler,,,
 (laughs) No you can’t.,,,Chandler,,,
" You don’t want to be guys, you’d be all hairy and wouldn’t live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (Starts to cry),,,Chandler,,,
" No thanks, Mom!",,,Chandler,,,
" Ahh, come on! Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’m just gonna go home and call Kathy.",,,Chandler,,,
" No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I’m gonna get so drunk, I’m gonna wanna call Janice",,,Chandler,,,
 Ohhh!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
 Stripping!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, look, I’m gonna have to ask you all to leave.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn’t picture myself with any of them. (Sits back in disgust.)",,,Chandler,,,
 (jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!,,,Chandler,,,
 I am totally picturing you with all those women!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I’m there too!",,,Chandler,,,
 Stop it! You’re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!,,,Chandler,,,
 Where I don’t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have s*x with strippers and my friends!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Come on, let me see that smile.",,,Chandler,,,
 Please?,,,Chandler,,,
" I know, I know, but you’re gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right ladies, here’s what we’re gonna do. (Points to a stripper.) You are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two, go get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, ""Chandler’s the king! Chandler’s the king!""",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, that’s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.",,,Chandler,,,
" Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!",,,Chandler,,,
" What do you want from me, I’ve never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (The cigarette guy starts rubbing Chandler’s back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right, listen, I’ve got to wake up!",,,Chandler,,,
 You said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!,,,Chandler,,,
 That’s a mailman! That’s our mailman! (Waves to the mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!",,,Chandler,,,
 Isn’t this amazing?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. Bye.,,,Chandler,,,
 Bye.,,,Chandler,,,
 Bye.,,,Chandler,,,
 B-bye!,,,Chandler,,,
" Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After it’s closed) I can’t stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality—Well, they’re all back! Y’know? And she’s picked up like nine new ones!",,,Chandler,,,
 Don’t worry about it. I’m taking care of it tonight. (Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.),,,Chandler,,,
" (standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I don’t have to break up with her this time. We’re not involved! I’m going to do a pre-emptive strike! I’m going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the fridge.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.",,,Chandler,,,
" (laughs) Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship…",,,Chandler,,,
 Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.,,,Chandler,,,
" I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!",,,Chandler,,,
" No! No! Not, Paris.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen. That’s right, yes, I’m being transferred to Yemen!",,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t know exactly.,,,Chandler,,,
 But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I’m packing. Y’know I’m-I’m packing ‘cause I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow.",,,Chandler,,,
" I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen, it’s the only way I can get rid off her.",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!",,,Chandler,,,
 (from his bedroom) Thanks!,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, we’re really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay. Then I guess it’s just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign that says, Wait Here."") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.",,,Chandler,,,
 What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?,,,Chandler,,,
" No. All right, y’know what, she’s (Points to Janice) gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.",,,Chandler,,,
 (to the ticket agent) American Express?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I-I guess I gotta go.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.",,,Chandler,,,
 No!,,,Chandler,,,
" Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I then guess I’m going to Yemen! I’m going to Yemen! (To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?",,,Chandler,,,
 Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you writing?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of style—what did you throw away?",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi guys!,,,Chandler,,,
 Without me?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it.",,,Chandler,,,
 Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you talking about?,,,Chandler,,,
 Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to the living room.),,,Chandler,,,
 Like what?,,,Chandler,,,
" I said, ""Like what?""",,,Chandler,,,
 Does for me.,,,Chandler,,,
 Flashdance.,,,Chandler,,,
 She was a welder.,,,Chandler,,,
 What are the odds? What are the odds?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the sandwich to Phoebe.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh-ho, yeah!",,,Chandler,,,
 Treeger’s snaking the shower drain.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Do we pay for this?,,,Chandler,,,
 Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill—free phone s*x.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!",,,Chandler,,,
 Like finding money with naked people on it!,,,Chandler,,,
 We don’t know what could make this go away.,,,Chandler,,,
 And no one touches the air around the TV!,,,Chandler,,,
 We still have p0rn.,,,Chandler,,,
 Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.,,,Chandler,,,
 It’s the theme from Good Will Humping.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?",,,Chandler,,,
 They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.,,,Chandler,,,
" Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?",,,Chandler,,,
" All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it’s over.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (Pause) Good one.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a p0rn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.",,,Chandler,,,
 Because then we would be the guys who turned off free p0rn.,,,Chandler,,,
 Pregnant Woman Slays Four?,,,Chandler,,,
 What’s the second part of your plan?,,,Chandler,,,
 You put your fist through the wall?,,,Chandler,,,
 A place where no one will ever get out alive?,,,Chandler,,,
 Are we in London?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.",,,Chandler,,,
" What, no, ""Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?""",,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know what, we have to turn off the p0rn.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, ready?",,,Chandler,,,
 Two.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.",,,Chandler,,,
 You wanna see if we still have it?,,,Chandler,,,
 FREE p0rn!!!,,,Chandler,,,
 We have free p0rn here!!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.",,,Chandler,,,
 All right.,,,Chandler,,,
 Wouldn’t that be Frank the III?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesn’t think so.) Oh, come on! Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you get to know him.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you’re really hot.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 And now you’re giving me the message!,,,Chandler,,,
 You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.,,,Chandler,,,
 Raymond Chandler.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, there are no famous Joey’s. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey.",,,Chandler,,,
" Wow, you’re, you’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.",,,Chandler,,,
 I have no name.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?",,,Chandler,,,
 It’s Clint. It’s Clint! (He heads for his bedroom.),,,Chandler,,,
 It’s Clint! Clint!,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?",,,Chandler,,,
" All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.",,,Chandler,,,
 (pleased) Really?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. Thanks.,,,Chandler,,,
 You wanna hug it out?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yay!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay!,,,Chandler,,,
" Bye, Pheebs!",,,Chandler,,,
 Ha! Ha! Ha!,,,Chandler,,,
 Ho! Ho! Ho!,,,Chandler,,,
 Your pants!,,,Chandler,,,
 Santa pants. (Phoebe still doesn’t get it.) Santa Claus’s pants.,,,Chandler,,,
" Uhh, a T-shirt that says, ""I don’t belong here.""",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah we do!,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you serious?,,,Chandler,,,
" Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!",,,Chandler,,,
" No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.",,,Chandler,,,
" (ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?",,,Chandler,,,
" Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up the apartment.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
 You do know that Wham broke up?,,,Chandler,,,
 Where is Emily?,,,Chandler,,,
" Man, didn’t she like just get here?",,,Chandler,,,
 Easy tiger.,,,Chandler,,,
 So what are you going to do?,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you serious?,,,Chandler,,,
" Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!",,,Chandler,,,
" And I love the milk! But, I’m not gonna some British girl to move in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.",,,Chandler,,,
 No thank you.,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.",,,Chandler,,,
 Screw the Knicks!,,,Chandler,,,
 I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.,,,Chandler,,,
 And the Knicks rule all.,,,Chandler,,,
" No. No. We’re not gonna do that, y’know why? Because its not an even trade.",,,Chandler,,,
 No!,,,Chandler,,,
" Op, op, I’m convinced!",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, but you can’t use that again for a whole year. I’m in.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay!,,,Chandler,,,
" Fine, let’s do it.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s a low one!,,,Chandler,,,
 Why are you screaming and hugging?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah baby!,,,Chandler,,,
 Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) That’s courtside baby!,,,Chandler,,,
 No they didn’t!,,,Chandler,,,
 Those were like the best seats ever.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, that’s very nice. Plus, y’know they were free and they’re too small.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head cut off.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I KNOW!!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Open up! Open up! Open up!,,,Chandler,,,
 What the hell is going on?!,,,Chandler,,,
" We are switching back, right now!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you’re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we’re switching it back! There’s nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t care, this is our apartment! And they stole—you stole it—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I’m getting back right now!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us!",,,Chandler,,,
 Totally worth it!,,,Chandler,,,
 Good night.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, well, that’s great!",,,Chandler,,,
 Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?",,,Chandler,,,
" Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? (Gunther starts to pour him another cup.) So uh, what do you do when you’re not working here?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, okay, thanks. (He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica, Joey, and Phoebe.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I’m exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!",,,Chandler,,,
" It’s not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!",,,Chandler,,,
 They don’t have those.,,,Chandler,,,
" Next time you snore, I’m rolling ya over!",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, all right!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, she’s got you running errands, y’know, picking up wedding dresses… (Laughs and makes like Indiana Jones and his whip) Wah-pah!",,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know, whipped! Wah-pah!",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s what I did. Wah-pah!,,,Chandler,,,
" All right buddy, time to roll over. (Rolls him over, and discovers a surprise) (Looking down) No-no! (Covers his eyes) No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You’re going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!",,,Chandler,,,
 It’s 6:00.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that’s, I think that’s really cool.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well, I don’t dance at weddings.",,,Chandler,,,
" Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this… (Starts to dancing really, really, really badly. Ross enters behind him and he stops.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Nothing.,,,Chandler,,,
 (answering for him) Yes he did.,,,Chandler,,,
" (waking Joey) Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!",,,Chandler,,,
" You’re coming on to the entire room! (He goes over to pick up a stack of magazines next to her, and to get her attention, he throws them back down.) I’m Chandler.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi.,,,Chandler,,,
 You mind if I…,,,Chandler,,,
" So uh, what are you in for?",,,Chandler,,,
" What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.",,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hello! Little ones.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (They’re stunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.",,,Chandler,,,
 Because I’m cooler.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well she’s, she’s the kinda girl—Joey was unconscious.",,,Chandler,,,
" Plus, you look cool.",,,Chandler,,,
 Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.,,,Chandler,,,
" Phoebe is, making people.",,,Chandler,,,
" And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!",,,Chandler,,,
" No-no, not something stupid, something huge.",,,Chandler,,,
" Why not?! I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing! It’s just, it’s just steep!",,,Chandler,,,
" We’re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah baby!,,,Chandler,,,
" (dejected) Yeah, well…",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!",,,Chandler,,,
" (dejected) Oh, well…",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeeeeahhhh.,,,Chandler,,,
 But I’ll tell you something. One of these days we’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!,,,Chandler,,,
 And I just want a million dollars! (EXTENDS HIS HAND HOPEFULLY),,,Chandler,,,
 Uh-oh.,,,Chandler,,,
 She was not good. Not good.,,,Chandler,,,
 Uh-oh.,,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hello!,,,Chandler,,,
 (sarcastic) Noo.,,,Chandler,,,
 I didn’t know that.,,,Chandler,,,
" See, maybe that’s the one we should’ve actually hidden.",,,Chandler,,,
" This isn’t one of those uh, y’know ""If she doesn’t come, we-we don’t, we don’t come?"" Right? Because I already bought my ticket…",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, that's Ross's.",,,Chandler,,,
" Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?",,,Chandler,,,
 [stuttering incoherently] F-hah.... flennin....,,,Chandler,,,
 I KNEW IT!!!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the book.) ""It’s almost as good as being there.""",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.",,,Chandler,,,
" If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" (shocked) Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, it’s awkward. It’s awkward. It’s awkward.",,,Chandler,,,
 You can be the best man when I get married.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no-no-no, you—yeah, of course you get to be my best man.",,,Chandler,,,
" I’m not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!",,,Chandler,,,
 I’m not even… I’m not even…,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Hey guys, what are you doing?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I’m Ross. I’m Ross. I’m too good for the Hut; I’m too good for the Hut.",,,Chandler,,,
" See ya. (Ross exits, and Chandler moves over next to Joey, laughing.) Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.",,,Chandler,,,
" He just said, ""No strippers.""",,,Chandler,,,
" (banging a spoon against his beer bottle) Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I’ve decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!",,,Chandler,,,
 Central Perk?,,,Chandler,,,
" (banging on the bottle again) Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, (to the stripper) so is the position of the bride.",,,Chandler,,,
 (opening the door) What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this—Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You’re the worst best man ever!",,,Chandler,,,
 You slept with the stripper?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little squeeze.)",,,Chandler,,,
" So you might say, it’s a magic ring.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I think it all started when you said, ""Hey Joey, why don’t you be my best man.""",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all turn there backs on her.),,,Chandler,,,
" Way to be cool, man.",,,Chandler,,,
 Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.),,,Chandler,,,
" He will, Joe.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, come on, it’s not your fault.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, you should.",,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks man.,,,Chandler,,,
 What a baby.,,,Chandler,,,
 Six-hour trip to London. That’s a lot of Monica.,,,Chandler,,,
 You got your passport?,,,Chandler,,,
 There it is.,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering, with Joey) All right! Let’s do it!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, ‘cause that’s not gonna get annoying.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, y’know what? I was wrong.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! (Trots over),,,Chandler,,,
 Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebe’s book as Rachel comes in from her room.),,,Chandler,,,
" (entering, with Phoebe’s book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.",,,Chandler,,,
" I am, I’m ignoring you.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, what the hell is that?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay. Listen-listen, we’re not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?",,,Chandler,,,
" I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.",,,Chandler,,,
 To Put the Camera Away!!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I don’t have to buy that, ""I’m with stupid"" T-shirt anymore.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?",,,Chandler,,,
 How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, wait. All right, that’s it, okay, I’m out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand and walks away trying to be cool.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey. (He nods at the hat.),,,Chandler,,,
" No-no-no, y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I’ve had a really lousy day.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
 That’s… That’s was…,,,Chandler,,,
 How did you? How? How?,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m gonna go to the bathroom.,,,Chandler,,,
 That was pretty intense huh?,,,Chandler,,,
 (glares at him) I hope he did!,,,Chandler,,,
" Joey, it’s been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.",,,Chandler,,,
" I’d like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. (No one in the room laughs. He starts to get flustered.) Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (Ross looks embarrassed.) And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he over inflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in the room laughs.) Ohh, Dear God.. (A cellular phone rings.)",,,Chandler,,,
" (Continuing his toast.) And I’m sure we’re all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. (No reaction from the people.) Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily. (He sits down.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Out loud?,,,Chandler,,,
 So how are you doing?,,,Chandler,,,
" The guy was hammered, okay? There’s no way, you look like Ross’s mother.",,,Chandler,,,
 Because he’s crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn’t want you?",,,Chandler,,,
" (With the covers pulled up to his chin.) Morning, Ross.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah you are!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Well I’ve-I’ve never done that with you before.,,,Chandler,,,
" So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You?(Looking over at her. She looks back.) We did you.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yea yea, absolutely.",,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t want to look.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 (Very defensive.) I’m not seeing Monica.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my god!,,,Chandler,,,
 No!! Okay!! What’s with the third degree?! Why don’t you just shine a light in my eyes?! (Joey looks totally confused.),,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yea, your right. It’s the second one.",,,Chandler,,,
 What we did last night was....,,,Chandler,,,
 Totally crazy stupid. (He nods his head at the people seated.),,,Chandler,,,
" I’m coming over tonight though, right?",,,Chandler,,,
" It could’ve been worse, he could’ve shot her.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh wow, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I’m just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.",,,Chandler,,,
 Seven times!,,,Chandler,,,
" In a foreign, romantic country…",,,Chandler,,,
 Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.),,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I don’t see that we have a choice. But, when we’re back home, we don’t do it.",,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs…",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay!,,,Chandler,,,
" Forget it, that’s off.",,,Chandler,,,
 The man’s got a point.,,,Chandler,,,
" Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, ""Yippee!"" just ignore me.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, hello Rachel.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, we’ll be down in like five minutes.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yay…",,,Chandler,,,
" (To Monica) Hey, listen, why don’t we go change in my room?",,,Chandler,,,
" Wow, you look…",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I’ve got a girl in here.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, we’re-we’re hanging out in here!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I suppose I’d have to say you!! But, what if we’re watching a movie in here?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, Ross and Emily aren’t gonna use it.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects s*x. The room would be disappointed if it didn’t get s*x. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay!,,,Chandler,,,
" Nope, not under here!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you couldn’t have looked everywhere or else you would’ve found her!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, for about 30 minutes.",,,Chandler,,,
" Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, we’re gonna go.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, it’s a very large plane.",,,Chandler,,,
" But, we’ll stay here with you.",,,Chandler,,,
 We have to leave for New York in an hour.,,,Chandler,,,
" We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something) Y’know, technically we still are over international waters.",,,Chandler,,,
 ‘Kay!,,,Chandler,,,
" Uhh, no.",,,Chandler,,,
 No.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.),,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 No we didn’t!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes! Good thing we have that, ‘Not in New York’ rule.",,,Chandler,,,
 Right.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh. Y’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn’t because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me ‘cause, you’re really hot! Is that okay?",,,Chandler,,,
 And I’m cute too.,,,Chandler,,,
" Thank you! (They hug.) All right, I gotta go unpack.",,,Chandler,,,
 Bye.,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) I’m still on London time, does that count?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, good! (They start kissing.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Ehh, you're just liquored up.",,,Chandler,,,
" I've had a very long, hard day.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.",,,Chandler,,,
" For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!",,,Chandler,,,
" Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Joe!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, Pheebs!",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, The Wheat Chief.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.",,,Chandler,,,
 I can't believe she can out run you man!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh that's not true.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I gotta go to work.",,,Chandler,,,
" And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.",,,Chandler,,,
" Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Always a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?",,,Chandler,,,
" I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.",,,Chandler,,,
" So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kisses her.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her and kisses her.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. (Gets up to leave.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, Pheebs!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y'know, it didn't have any… It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!",,,Chandler,,,
 Atlantic City!,,,Chandler,,,
 Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!,,,Chandler,,,
" I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having s*x.",,,Chandler,,,
 No.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (They kiss again.),,,Chandler,,,
 That's right.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh no.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! You okay?,,,Chandler,,,
" Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?",,,Chandler,,,
 All right…,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.",,,Chandler,,,
 Really? Male nurses?,,,Chandler,,,
 So they're going on dates? When?,,,Chandler,,,
" This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?",,,Chandler,,,
 All right.,,,Chandler,,,
 (spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.",,,Chandler,,,
 Fine! Maybe I will too!,,,Chandler,,,
" So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh.,,,Chandler,,,
" Sure. (Pause) And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way. (Retreats in defeat.)",,,Chandler,,,
" (to another female nurse) Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?",,,Chandler,,,
 All right. Very good.,,,Chandler,,,
" Bye, momi-moo.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh God, kindergarten flashback.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, keep saying it!",,,Chandler,,,
" So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary… Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing s*x and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.",,,Chandler,,,
" Really? Okay, so…",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?",,,Chandler,,,
 Right!,,,Chandler,,,
" So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?",,,Chandler,,,
" That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering, happily, with a bottle of champagne, thinking that Monica is the only one there) Ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!",,,Chandler,,,
 Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.,,,Chandler,,,
" Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",,,Chandler,,,
 Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?,,,Chandler,,,
" Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And you, you lucky dog!",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes!,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?",,,Chandler,,,
" If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?",,,Chandler,,,
" Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. (He jumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.",,,Chandler,,,
 That's true!,,,Chandler,,,
 That's true!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, there he is! There he is!",,,Chandler,,,
" How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.",,,Chandler,,,
" Expect it in 4-6 weeks. (She starts to leave.) Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why?,,,Chandler,,,
 What's your point?,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.",,,Chandler,,,
" I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH…MY…GOD.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to s*x!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts to take off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, let's show them how it's done.",,,Chandler,,,
 Y'know that wasn't part of it?,,,Chandler,,,
 Nope.,,,Chandler,,,
 (quietly) Hi! (They both start kissing.),,,Chandler,,,
" Uhh, 9. (He pushes the clock into the sink.)",,,Chandler,,,
" I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. (He starts for his bedroom.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.,,,Chandler,,,
 What's going on?,,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, hey!",,,Chandler,,,
 We're flipping Monica's mattress.,,,Chandler,,,
" Aww, man! (They go into Monica's room.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yes, somebody just said, ""Can you hear anything?""",,,Chandler,,,
 Condoms?,,,Chandler,,,
 And condoms are the way to do that?,,,Chandler,,,
 (jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!",,,Chandler,,,
" (looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!,,,Chandler,,,
 What? Why?,,,Chandler,,,
 Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.),,,Chandler,,,
 (turning to face her) Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
" I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.",,,Chandler,,,
" (watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?",,,Chandler,,,
 Do not speak ill of the dead.,,,Chandler,,,
" I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.",,,Chandler,,,
" I said, ""Geez, relax Monnnnn.""",,,Chandler,,,
 Damn Rollos!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another Rollo)",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.",,,Chandler,,,
 Monica. (Follows her out.),,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, fine, $300.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.",,,Chandler,,,
" Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.",,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes that was mine.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes that would have made more sense.,,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?",,,Chandler,,,
" So, I guess this is over.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.",,,Chandler,,,
" Because of the weekend, we had a fight.",,,Chandler,,,
" So, this isn't over?",,,Chandler,,,
 Really? Okay. Great!,,,Chandler,,,
 (stops her) We're in a relationship?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag Joey into Monica's room.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.),,,Chandler,,,
 It happened in London.,,,Chandler,,,
 The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.,,,Chandler,,,
 No-no-no-no-no! You can't!,,,Chandler,,,
 Fun's over!,,,Chandler,,,
 Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?,,,Chandler,,,
 Sorry.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hello!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.) That didn't happen, I made that up!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence…",,,Chandler,,,
 You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.,,,Chandler,,,
 So you're really okay with this?,,,Chandler,,,
" Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, what is in here? Rocks?",,,Chandler,,,
" So, rocks.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.",,,Chandler,,,
 Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I think it's very brave what you said.",,,Chandler,,,
" Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, Ross?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, we are so sorry.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, there-there she is!",,,Chandler,,,
 Are you looking at naked tribe's women?,,,Chandler,,,
 That's a pig.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! (Joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.),,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
 How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!",,,Chandler,,,
 He thought you said gonad.,,,Chandler,,,
 Love what you've done with the place.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yeah!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, the tears are real.",,,Chandler,,,
 What are you doing?,,,Chandler,,,
 You built a fort didn't ya?,,,Chandler,,,
" (notices something) Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I hate this thing!,,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hello children!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.),,,Chandler,,,
 Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?,,,Chandler,,,
 You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.),,,Chandler,,,
" (gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 No-no-no-no!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, so he's out of here.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?",,,Chandler,,,
 Not even on page 7?,,,Chandler,,,
 What about that circled one?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, it is.",,,Chandler,,,
 There we go!,,,Chandler,,,
 Let's go quicker.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.",,,Chandler,,,
 It's a kitchen slash bathroom.,,,Chandler,,,
 We are bad people.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes that was a nice place!,,,Chandler,,,
" Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!",,,Chandler,,,
 What are we gonna do?,,,Chandler,,,
 About Ross!,,,Chandler,,,
" (grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tap dancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp! (Listens.) There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello?",,,Chandler,,,
 Ohhhhh!,,,Chandler,,,
" 98. 99. 100. Okay, go!",,,Chandler,,,
 Here we go! Here we go!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" You're kidding, no!",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes! Ross, you have to stay!",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, buddy!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?",,,Chandler,,,
 All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?,,,Chandler,,,
" That's sweet, Joey.",,,Chandler,,,
 Are you aware that you're still talking?,,,Chandler,,,
 No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.,,,Chandler,,,
" It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.",,,Chandler,,,
" Really? Worse than, ""More turkey Mr. Chandler?""",,,Chandler,,,
 It's exactly like it sounds.,,,Chandler,,,
" Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in the doorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm over here big guy.,,,Chandler,,,
 (laughing) You did look like an idiot.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.",,,Chandler,,,
 (seeing her) Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.",,,Chandler,,,
 Emotional Knapsack?,,,Chandler,,,
" Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.",,,Chandler,,,
" Dude, don't do that too me!",,,Chandler,,,
" No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.",,,Chandler,,,
 I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!,,,Chandler,,,
 I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!,,,Chandler,,,
" I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.",,,Chandler,,,
 We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
" You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!",,,Chandler,,,
 Sorry!,,,Chandler,,,
 Sorry.,,,Chandler,,,
" Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you all right?,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Without my toe?! I need my toe!,,,Chandler,,,
 That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!,,,Chandler,,,
 That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (He storms out.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I can't believe this.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, ""Quack, quack!"" I’m happy all the time!",,,Chandler,,,
 Nice try.,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, Monica…",,,Chandler,,,
 This is not going to work.,,,Chandler,,,
 You are so great! I love you!,,,Chandler,,,
" Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!",,,Chandler,,,
 No I didn't!,,,Chandler,,,
 No I didn't!,,,Chandler,,,
 No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!,,,Chandler,,,
 Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another but can't) I'm out.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!",,,Chandler,,,
 See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah!,,,Chandler,,,
 (interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, yeah actually.",,,Chandler,,,
" I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.",,,Chandler,,,
 Help!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hi, Pheebs!",,,Chandler,,,
 I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, what did the police say?",,,Chandler,,,
" Ross, it's just a sandwich!",,,Chandler,,,
" (reading) Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?",,,Chandler,,,
" Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?",,,Chandler,,,
 What is going on here?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
" No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh—I don't know.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 (gasps) You're naked in this picture!,,,Chandler,,,
 Ross?,,,Chandler,,,
" Which I may say, right now, is out of control.",,,Chandler,,,
 And you're okay with that?,,,Chandler,,,
 (Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.),,,Chandler,,,
" All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.",,,Chandler,,,
 Joey's a s*x addict.,,,Chandler,,,
 Well let's….let's see what everybody thinks of that?,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a s*x addict?,,,Chandler,,,
" (Answering the phone at work) Hello, Chandler Bing.",,,Chandler,,,
" (Angrily) Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! (Ross and Joey laugh silently.) It’s been six months! It’s not funny!",,,Chandler,,,
" Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!! (Joey hangs up.)",,,Chandler,,,
 The British are coming?,,,Chandler,,,
 Ohh.,,,Chandler,,,
 Why?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I'll stop.",,,Chandler,,,
 You wanna play?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm intrigued.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.",,,Chandler,,,
 Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven mitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid—Op! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?",,,Chandler,,,
" (To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.",,,Chandler,,,
" The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?",,,Chandler,,,
 I paid for those tickets!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.),,,Chandler,,,
 When did that happen to you?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!",,,Chandler,,,
 I don't believe they're brother and sister.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?",,,Chandler,,,
" Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!,,,Chandler,,,
 All right. (Takes a copy.),,,Chandler,,,
 What is up?,,,Chandler,,,
" No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.",,,Chandler,,,
 Could I be more sorry. (Looks at Joey.),,,Chandler,,,
 (To Ross) I'm sorry too.,,,Chandler,,,
" I am sorry, Ross.",,,Chandler,,,
 This took you all day?!,,,Chandler,,,
" (deadpan, standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you.",,,Chandler,,,
" We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know…",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) Happy New Year!,,,Chandler,,,
" Do you want us to leave the room, or?",,,Chandler,,,
" That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.",,,Chandler,,,
" I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the ""new thing you do that day!"" (Ross looks at him.) And it starts right now!",,,Chandler,,,
 Nice!,,,Chandler,,,
 (reading it) Elizabeth Hornswoggle?,,,Chandler,,,
 Horn-swoggle.,,,Chandler,,,
" No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. (Sits down rubbing his temple.)",,,Chandler,,,
" What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.",,,Chandler,,,
" (notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.) Someone comment on the pants!",,,Chandler,,,
" That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's buttock.) Maybe there's something in that area.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh come on!! (Storms out.),,,Chandler,,,
" (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep.",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! (He sits down and sighs in relief.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Sorry man.,,,Chandler,,,
 Did they teach you that in your anger management class?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.",,,Chandler,,,
" I know, I can do this. (He takes her hand.)",,,Chandler,,,
" I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this is Monica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, sir.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, that was my work laugh.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!,,,Chandler,,,
" And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. (She glares at him.) Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at…bigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, good luck with that. (Exits.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.",,,Chandler,,,
 Let them win one.,,,Chandler,,,
 You're not even giving them a chance!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? (Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oopsey, missed it!",,,Chandler,,,
 Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.),,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed racquet from his bag.)",,,Chandler,,,
 It was my racquet.,,,Chandler,,,
 If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.",,,Chandler,,,
 Just a little bit of sugar.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, you get used to it.",,,Chandler,,,
" So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.),,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I just…",,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
" I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you, Monica.",,,Chandler,,,
 Coffee in a fight! (Does the laugh again.),,,Chandler,,,
" (from his bedroom) All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!",,,Chandler,,,
 But we're not ready to tell yet!,,,Chandler,,,
" Man, she is really gullible.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Why would I be mad?,,,Chandler,,,
" (realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.",,,Chandler,,,
 I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!,,,Chandler,,,
" And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down—let's write it down!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!",,,Chandler,,,
 It's your timer.,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, then massage me up right nice!",,,Chandler,,,
 Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!,,,Chandler,,,
 It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!,,,Chandler,,,
 Good-bye muscles!!,,,Chandler,,,
" I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just—I didn't know what it was!",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.",,,Chandler,,,
 (examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts looking for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.),,,Chandler,,,
 And you're gonna make them all disappear.,,,Chandler,,,
 Done.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!,,,Chandler,,,
 Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
 And a date with a man!,,,Chandler,,,
" (wincing) Yes, he is!",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, is Rachel here?",,,Chandler,,,
" (coming all the way in) Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.",,,Chandler,,,
 (falling into that trap) I don't like your massages.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, but now see you're crying!",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, ""Who's the best of that?"" They'd have to go to you.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!",,,Chandler,,,
 Absolutely!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah! (They hug.),,,Chandler,,,
" Hey man, how did the audition go?",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah umm, they're called wallets.",,,Chandler,,,
 And we're done with the chicken fried rice.,,,Chandler,,,
 Or we can do the actual telephone thing.,,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hello children!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles uncontrollably.) Are you okay?",,,Chandler,,,
" Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.",,,Chandler,,,
 What's going on?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.",,,Chandler,,,
 Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.,,,Chandler,,,
" The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.,,,Chandler,,,
 Ow!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!",,,Chandler,,,
 Well it's not flexed right now!,,,Chandler,,,
" Sure, I'll do it with ya.",,,Chandler,,,
 That new mountain bike?,,,Chandler,,,
 Your work makes me sad.,,,Chandler,,,
" (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?",,,Chandler,,,
 Are you serious?,,,Chandler,,,
 (a little hurt) Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps—She knows!,,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Joey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Phoebe knows about us!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh man!,,,Chandler,,,
" Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!",,,Chandler,,,
" Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding the phone so that Monica can hear it as well.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!",,,Chandler,,,
" (initially worried, but gets over it) Really?",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?",,,Chandler,,,
 How do you know?!,,,Chandler,,,
 At this?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Phoebe.,,,Chandler,,,
 Come on in.,,,Chandler,,,
 Sure.,,,Chandler,,,
 Me? No. You?,,,Chandler,,,
 So do I.,,,Chandler,,,
 I'm gonna put on some music.,,,Chandler,,,
 You look good.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, do you not want to?",,,Chandler,,,
 (swallowing hard) Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.,,,Chandler,,,
" Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, you're-you're going?",,,Chandler,,,
" (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the s*x.",,,Chandler,,,
 Not if I kiss you first.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have s*x with ya!,,,Chandler,,,
 Because I'm in love with Monica!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.",,,Chandler,,,
 And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. (Pause) And might I say your breasts are still showing.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.",,,Chandler,,,
" (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I'm going on the lamb.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.",,,Chandler,,,
 (interrupting) Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.,,,Chandler,,,
" Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.",,,Chandler,,,
 Wh-wh-why?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!",,,Chandler,,,
" I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay. It's not different at all, is it?",,,Chandler,,,
 Hmm.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you do want all that stuff, right?",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!",,,Chandler,,,
 Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I did not know that.",,,Chandler,,,
" It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.",,,Chandler,,,
 By me?,,,Chandler,,,
 Monica. (Goes to talk to her.),,,Chandler,,,
 Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.",,,Chandler,,,
 Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?,,,Chandler,,,
" I need to talk to you, it's urgent!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and awkwardly gets down on one knee.)",,,Chandler,,,
 (getting out a ring box) Monica…,,,Chandler,,,
 Will you marry me?,,,Chandler,,,
 I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.,,,Chandler,,,
 I'm doing this because I'm sorry?,,,Chandler,,,
" No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.) Will you be my wife?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I didn't think I was!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. (Points at the door.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, how long is this going to go on.",,,Chandler,,,
 That's not funny.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. (To Monica) Hey, how about maroon?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hi, Joe.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!",,,Chandler,,,
 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! I don’t want to talk about it.,,,Chandler,,,
" You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! (To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. (Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) I love you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)",,,Chandler,,,
" No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.",,,Chandler,,,
" Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?",,,Chandler,,,
 Well there you have it!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.",,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so…",,,Chandler,,,
" (looking at the sketch) Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 (straining) Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!",,,Chandler,,,
 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?",,,Chandler,,,
" (stopping him) Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?",,,Chandler,,,
" Ooh, I do! I do! I do!",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Rachel) He has a gun!,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Hey Monica, here's your broom back.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh hey, how'd the interview go?",,,Chandler,,,
 So what happened?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.",,,Chandler,,,
" Come on, Rach.",,,Chandler,,,
" I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizes something, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and kisses her.)",,,Chandler,,,
" (To Gary) So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you… (He gestures and spills some of his coffee.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, yeah.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why?,,,Chandler,,,
" Ohh, so?",,,Chandler,,,
" Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have s*x over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.",,,Chandler,,,
 That was amazing!,,,Chandler,,,
 That was amazing.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, you're the best.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, you're the best.",,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the lining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee. (Heads for the bathroom.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?,,,Chandler,,,
" No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!",,,Chandler,,,
" Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!",,,Chandler,,,
 (gasps) So?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting. (Kisses her.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
 Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!,,,Chandler,,,
" Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.) And now we're back.",,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) You guys ready fore the movies?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (He picks the 9 of Spades),,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yes.,,,Chandler,,,
 (pause) Yes.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hi there!,,,Chandler,,,
 That.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?",,,Chandler,,,
" Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.",,,Chandler,,,
 Dude! That's my girlfriend!,,,Chandler,,,
 Weirder than watching his two moms make out? (Monica nods in agreement.),,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, it is the best.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I wanna go to babe.",,,Chandler,,,
 Ah sure. What's in 'em?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.",,,Chandler,,,
 Y'know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done.,,,Chandler,,,
" (shocked) Well I mean, let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the door.) Oh, hi! No one. (Exits.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!,,,Chandler,,,
 I wish I had smoked for my career…,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!",,,Chandler,,,
 I think you smell great! (He sniffs her shoulder.),,,Chandler,,,
" Great job with the cups, Pheebs!",,,Chandler,,,
 Awesome!,,,Chandler,,,
 There are snow cones! (Monica glares at him.) Snow cones! Yuck!,,,Chandler,,,
 Thank you! Thank you! (Runs to the snow cone machine.),,,Chandler,,,
" (to Kim and Nancy) Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, great.",,,Chandler,,,
 I'll catch you guys later. (Exits.),,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.",,,Chandler,,,
" Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, okay. (Hands her the money.) Here you go.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, bye!",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 I was not flirting.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.",,,Chandler,,,
 You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to move towards Ross.),,,Chandler,,,
 I was not flirting.,,,Chandler,,,
" I was not and oh God, shh!",,,Chandler,,,
 Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?,,,Chandler,,,
" So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She just stares at him.) I've done it again.",,,Chandler,,,
" Happy Anniversary, 10 months! (They kiss.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)",,,Chandler,,,
 The one that doesn't.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" If you said, ""Big lima bean, bubbling up."" Would she understand the difference?",,,Chandler,,,
 Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.,,,Chandler,,,
 You're welcome.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.,,,Chandler,,,
 Really?!,,,Chandler,,,
" (starts to laugh, but then gets serious) So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?",,,Chandler,,,
" (smiling) Well, what is it?",,,Chandler,,,
" (smiling) If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?",,,Chandler,,,
" Doesn't know, ""Hello."" But she knows Capricorn One.",,,Chandler,,,
" So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?",,,Chandler,,,
" See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, ""I'm just flirting, no big deal."" But the guy is thinking, ""Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!""",,,Chandler,,,
 It's true.,,,Chandler,,,
 Again true.,,,Chandler,,,
 All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.,,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime it for her.) Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So, you're old and small.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)",,,Chandler,,,
" (To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh the humanity.,,,Chandler,,,
 More so than anything else.,,,Chandler,,,
 Almost over man.,,,Chandler,,,
 Why am I looking?,,,Chandler,,,
 You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.,,,Chandler,,,
 (singing) Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown…engines…on!,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 You ready?,,,Chandler,,,
 You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.,,,Chandler,,,
 Let me see the earrings.,,,Chandler,,,
 (looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Ross) Thanks for picking out the earrings man.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey man, what's up?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, yeah! Me too!",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I like danger.",,,Chandler,,,
 Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.,,,Chandler,,,
 It is starting to get dark out there.,,,Chandler,,,
 (laughing) Okay. (Deadpan) But it is officially nighttime.,,,Chandler,,,
 Your tax dollars?,,,Chandler,,,
 (leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.,,,Chandler,,,
 I can't smell your sandwich?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey just glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
" Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?",,,Chandler,,,
 How do you figure that?,,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.",,,Chandler,,,
 Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!",,,Chandler,,,
" (deadpan) Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.",,,Chandler,,,
 What's going on?,,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, HELLO!!",,,Chandler,,,
 (pouting) It was a car backfire!,,,Chandler,,,
 Who jumps at loud noises!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets up and starts for the door.)",,,Chandler,,,
 (returning) Oh my God! (Storms out.),,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever…",,,Chandler,,,
" No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.",,,Chandler,,,
 You dove in front of Ross! Ross!,,,Chandler,,,
 I do not hate Ross!,,,Chandler,,,
 What picture?,,,Chandler,,,
" Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!",,,Chandler,,,
" When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.",,,Chandler,,,
 From a bullet!,,,Chandler,,,
 Much sense?!,,,Chandler,,,
" So you risked your life, for a sandwich!",,,Chandler,,,
" So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.",,,Chandler,,,
 Really?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks. (He grabs the sandwich.),,,Chandler,,,
" (with his mouthful) Oh-oi-ho, yeah!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hm-hmm. (Goes to take another bite.),,,Chandler,,,
 I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.,,,Chandler,,,
 Before or after you were shot by your own troops?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.",,,Chandler,,,
" (To Monica) Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hiya doin' pumpkin?,,,Chandler,,,
" (terrified) Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)",,,Chandler,,,
" So, what are you gonna do?",,,Chandler,,,
 Me?! Why me?,,,Chandler,,,
" I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.",,,Chandler,,,
" (To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he nods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.),,,Chandler,,,
" Gary, I'm here to report a crime.",,,Chandler,,,
 It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!",,,Chandler,,,
 You mean scared.,,,Chandler,,,
 Scared? Happy?,,,Chandler,,,
" I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!",,,Chandler,,,
" Were you're parents happy, or something?",,,Chandler,,,
" Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!",,,Chandler,,,
" (pause) Yeah, you're right about that.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes I did, and I think you should do it.",,,Chandler,,,
" He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.",,,Chandler,,,
" I’m sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Gar!,,,Chandler,,,
 Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the game.)",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 I'm not a dropper!,,,Chandler,,,
 It's throwing and catching!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses control and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.",,,Chandler,,,
 Not fun anymore?,,,Chandler,,,
" Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh that is over!,,,Chandler,,,
 You guys wanna eat here?,,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the phone, an apple, a Frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his chest. I'm not going to describe them, you'll have to see them.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, so Richard, Richard!",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" How much did I love The King and I? (Oh, you get the point by now.)",,,Chandler,,,
 You okay there man?,,,Chandler,,,
" Wow umm, calm down.",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?",,,Chandler,,,
 You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I know that means buddy!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.",,,Chandler,,,
" Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, great, road trip baby! (To Monica) This okay with you?",,,Chandler,,,
 Thank you.,,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?",,,Chandler,,,
" I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?",,,Chandler,,,
 So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, bye-bye now!",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay!,,,Chandler,,,
" We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 Isn't that Ross's money?,,,Chandler,,,
 I don't know.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay!,,,Chandler,,,
 Too dry.,,,Chandler,,,
 No!,,,Chandler,,,
 No!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes.,,,Chandler,,,
" I also said, ""Yes!""",,,Chandler,,,
 No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.",,,Chandler,,,
 They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!,,,Chandler,,,
" Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, you don't want me on the trip?",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!",,,Chandler,,,
 You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.,,,Chandler,,,
" All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.",,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!,,,Chandler,,,
" I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?",,,Chandler,,,
 (who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!,,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?",,,Chandler,,,
 That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of p0rn…,,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes) Let me talk to him!,,,Chandler,,,
" (To Phoebe) Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Joey) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!",,,Chandler,,,
 Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!,,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, what was that?",,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.,,,Chandler,,,
 Huh.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Wow!,,,Chandler,,,
 Do we have to?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I think we should see other people.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes.,,,Chandler,,,
 It's a great idea. (They kiss),,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our (His and Monica's) anniversary.",,,Chandler,,,
 (coughing) Art lover!,,,Chandler,,,
 I said art lover.,,,Chandler,,,
" I don't know, I'm very tired.",,,Chandler,,,
 So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) Happy plane-aversary.,,,Chandler,,,
 Can I give you a present now?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay! (He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) Oh man! Don’t tell me I did this!,,,Chandler,,,
" How do you feel about the, ""I really did forgot the present, please forgive me"" not fake out?",,,Chandler,,,
 Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!,,,Chandler,,,
 What-what Richard thing?,,,Chandler,,,
 What Richard thing?,,,Chandler,,,
 (talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God.,,,Chandler,,,
 Love your condoms my man.,,,Chandler,,,
 Why?! What happened?!,,,Chandler,,,
" No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.",,,Chandler,,,
 No! Her boyfriend Richard!,,,Chandler,,,
 When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!,,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks. (They hug.),,,Chandler,,,
 (pushing her away from another hug) Next time?,,,Chandler,,,
 There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!,,,Chandler,,,
" That's so funny, because I think I just did!",,,Chandler,,,
 Fine with me!,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you talking…,,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
" (interrupting in the nick of time) Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.",,,Chandler,,,
 Whoa!,,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Good luck!,,,Chandler,,,
 I see.,,,Chandler,,,
 (totally confused) What?,,,Chandler,,,
 What's an identical hand twin?,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?,,,Chandler,,,
 (totally confused) How?,,,Chandler,,,
" Again I must go back to, how?",,,Chandler,,,
" (Pause) Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.",,,Chandler,,,
" No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!",,,Chandler,,,
 No!,,,Chandler,,,
 That was Joey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.",,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (He gets up and goes to find her.),,,Chandler,,,
 (walking by with his luggage) See you later Mon.,,,Chandler,,,
 What does it look like? I'm going home.,,,Chandler,,,
 Come on! I was there! (He's propped up with his hand on a statute of a naked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.) I know he's the love of your life.,,,Chandler,,,
 Really?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.",,,Chandler,,,
 (arm-in-arm with Monica) Hey Pheebs!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. (They start kissing.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?",,,Chandler,,,
 8. 8!,,,Chandler,,,
" If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!",,,Chandler,,,
 Noo!,,,Chandler,,,
" Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.",,,Chandler,,,
 Two fours.,,,Chandler,,,
" Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! (Everyone cheers) Wait-wait-wait-wait! We (motions to Monica and him.) get the biggest suite in the place.",,,Chandler,,,
 (sees the roll) Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!,,,Chandler,,,
 Another hard 8.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; (pause) and we get married here tonight.",,,Chandler,,,
 You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!,,,Chandler,,,
 (spots one) Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?,,,Chandler,,,
 All right!,,,Chandler,,,
 Here it is! Here it is!,,,Chandler,,,
 It's a four.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.",,,Chandler,,,
 Let's go! (Starts to leave.),,,Chandler,,,
" Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.",,,Chandler,,,
 I don't think so.,,,Chandler,,,
 (looks around) Here just…take this. (Hands her the sweater.),,,Chandler,,,
" No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Hello! One marriage please!,,,Chandler,,,
 (singing) Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes! Well that-yes.,,,Chandler,,,
 We actually missed it.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hi!,,,Chandler,,,
" So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?",,,Chandler,,,
 It’s a buffet man.,,,Chandler,,,
" Listen, I gotta talk to you.",,,Chandler,,,
 Monica and I almost got married last night.,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?",,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
 (returning with Joey) Hi.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…,,,Chandler,,,
 (not quite sure) You did.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free.",,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!,,,Chandler,,,
 So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.",,,Chandler,,,
 Sounds great.,,,Chandler,,,
 Ready!,,,Chandler,,,
" (deadpan) Yes, yes eight.",,,Chandler,,,
" That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess.",,,Chandler,,,
" That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah. (They go pack.) We’re doing the right thing, right?",,,Chandler,,,
 Well you did pull his hair.,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m not getting into this again!,,,Chandler,,,
"  Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay. (He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)",,,Chandler,,,
 No!,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.",,,Chandler,,,
 Me too!,,,Chandler,,,
 No!,,,Chandler,,,
" Jeez, relax! It’s not like we’re mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering, slowly) Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, what if all my stuff was here?",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?,,,Chandler,,,
 Me asking is kind of a sign.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay!!!!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh thanks.,,,Chandler,,,
" The door hasn’t been locked in five years, but okay! (Runs out.) Ready?!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t get in!",,,Chandler,,,
 This is not a sign!,,,Chandler,,,
 It’s an old key!,,,Chandler,,,
 I love you!,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you hugging the door right now.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah-yeah, me neither.",,,Chandler,,,
 The key’s stuck in the lock.,,,Chandler,,,
 (trying the handle) It still doesn’t work.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh.,,,Chandler,,,
 Nice job Joe! You’re quite the craftsmen.,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?",,,Chandler,,,
" No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, ""Joey, I have too…"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""…go to the bathroom."" He may think I’m sick.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?",,,Chandler,,,
 All right.,,,Chandler,,,
" No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, here’s the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I’m gonna be moving out man.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!",,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 (looking down) What gave me away?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It’s official, we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?",,,Chandler,,,
 Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.),,,Chandler,,,
 Rach…,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, Joey’s my best friend.",,,Chandler,,,
 You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches for one.),,,Chandler,,,
 Hey-hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 I am now!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, bye! (Exits.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",,,Chandler,,,
 Not once did we do that.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?",,,Chandler,,,
 And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!",,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!,,,Chandler,,,
 Who was it?,,,Chandler,,,
 Sure!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely.""",,,Chandler,,,
" So, that’s it?",,,Chandler,,,
 Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!,,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!",,,Chandler,,,
" No, I’m not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful guest room. (Exits.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.",,,Chandler,,,
" (reading the ad) ""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" Nice!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get girls, and now I can ‘em—Now, I have you. (Monica glares at him.) Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women…",,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
 Ohh.,,,Chandler,,,
 That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.,,,Chandler,,,
 We don’t have to come up with this now.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Is that a problem?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!",,,Chandler,,,
 In the game room!,,,Chandler,,,
 All right! That’s fine! That’s fine! I won’t bring over the chairs! I won’t bring anything over! I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma’s place!! (Storms out.),,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potential roommate) Hi! I’ll be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.),,,Chandler,,,
 Why did you take the shower curtain down?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mocks him and he joins in.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s laughter.,,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t know.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I do.",,,Chandler,,,
" He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah that’s not worried. {Transcriber’s note: I think that’s what he says, if anyone thinks any different let me know. ‘Cause that sentence doesn’t make sense to me, but I played it 20 times and that’s what I came up with.}",,,Chandler,,,
 Of course!,,,Chandler,,,
 Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God! Someone’s killed Square Man!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh that’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know those big-big uh, road signs that say ""Merge?""",,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that’s you and I together! Merge!",,,Chandler,,,
 Really?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, what’s the matter?",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh hi!,,,Chandler,,,
 Why don’t you open with a joke?,,,Chandler,,,
" Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild.",,,Chandler,,,
" (opens and reads it) ""Benefits lapsed.""",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.",,,Chandler,,,
 All right.,,,Chandler,,,
" I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to (pauses) stop catching on fire.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" That’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?",,,Chandler,,,
 What’s wrong with you?,,,Chandler,,,
 This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!,,,Chandler,,,
 That’s a hernia.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.) Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!",,,Chandler,,,
 I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!",,,Chandler,,,
" Listen, I’m really glad you got the part.",,,Chandler,,,
 But are you sure you can do this?,,,Chandler,,,
" Now, is that never talking about it again?!",,,Chandler,,,
" I’m sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don’t you uh, lift up your shirt? (He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex finally starts crying.) We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!",,,Chandler,,,
 What are you doing?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, all right.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?",,,Chandler,,,
" Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you’re not married to anymore of us are ya?",,,Chandler,,,
 You left a shoe here?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give him your shoe.",,,Chandler,,,
" (not enthused) Yeah, all right.",,,Chandler,,,
 Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I’m gonna pass. ‘Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.",,,Chandler,,,
" Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. (Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly smells something. It’s times like these I’m glad Smell-O-Vision hasn’t been invented.) Do you know what Pheebs? When you’re done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. (Phoebe is changing hers.)",,,Chandler,,,
 See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.,,,Chandler,,,
" I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around… (He degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his finger.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Shocking! Since you still have the keys.,,,Chandler,,,
 What equity investments?,,,Chandler,,,
 You don’t even have a car!,,,Chandler,,,
 And?,,,Chandler,,,
 There you are.,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog! (He holds up this Xena-like warrior action figure.)",,,Chandler,,,
 He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!,,,Chandler,,,
" They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!",,,Chandler,,,
" Glass, sand, whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to check on the babies again.)",,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybe you’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.,,,Chandler,,,
 I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying to cough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)",,,Chandler,,,
 But you found the keys to his clothes?,,,Chandler,,,
 That is true.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.",,,Chandler,,,
 I think that’s gum.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go.",,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.",,,Chandler,,,
 And protected them from a tornado?,,,Chandler,,,
 Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph.,,,Chandler,,,
 Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.,,,Chandler,,,
" (pause) Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!",,,Chandler,,,
" (watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that he’s scratching his back with it.) Listen, I’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.",,,Chandler,,,
 First of the month.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, just the months you actually want to live here.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)",,,Chandler,,,
" That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover you for a while?",,,Chandler,,,
" It’s not charity, Joe…",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay uh, here’s the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, yeah.",,,Chandler,,,
" So, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?",,,Chandler,,,
" No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it.",,,Chandler,,,
" I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.",,,Chandler,,,
 Well that would help the pride thing.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, but for the last time.",,,Chandler,,,
 He’s at a dinner party.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.",,,Chandler,,,
" Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes it would. What do you say to $50?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yes!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 No! No! No! No—(Joey looks at him)—one can beat me.,,,Chandler,,,
" See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.",,,Chandler,,,
 Still broken?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it’s fun.",,,Chandler,,,
 Cups.,,,Chandler,,,
" I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, it’s really easy and really, really fun.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens, what do you have?",,,Chandler,,,
" Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah! Okay, let’s play again. (He deals out two cards each again.) What do you got?",,,Chandler,,,
 You’re kidding right?,,,Chandler,,,
 Well that’s a full cup! (Pays him again.),,,Chandler,,,
 You win.,,,Chandler,,,
" It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?",,,Chandler,,,
 Not 700 exactly?,,,Chandler,,,
 Double it! (He does.),,,Chandler,,,
" Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, I didn’t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Don’t get to excited because that’s not gonna happen unless you get—No way! (He takes the top card, which is the two of clubs. Of course, any card would’ve won. Chandler pays him.)",,,Chandler,,,
 What’s wrong?,,,Chandler,,,
 Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh man!!,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, let’s play one more hand! One more!",,,Chandler,,,
 I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!,,,Chandler,,,
" No, but wait—what if I bought it from you, y’know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?",,,Chandler,,,
 When did I try to give you money?,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you’re okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 I know. (He kisses her.),,,Chandler,,,
 No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.),,,Chandler,,,
 Sure!,,,Chandler,,,
 I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.,,,Chandler,,,
 Exactly.,,,Chandler,,,
 It’s not a real game! I made it up!,,,Chandler,,,
 At a fake game!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hmm, let’s see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards and shrugs.)",,,Chandler,,,
 (not amused) And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.,,,Chandler,,,
 I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.",,,Chandler,,,
" So, uh, wh-where ya from?",,,Chandler,,,
 Unbelievable,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, look at all the boxes!",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?",,,Chandler,,,
 Now imagine you live at the supermarket.,,,Chandler,,,
 No-no,,,Chandler,,,
" OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. (Turns around and sees that Joey isn't there.) Joe? (Hears giggling coming from a box) Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack. (Hears the giggling again)",,,Chandler,,,
 (pretending) Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica’s gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?",,,Chandler,,,
 What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!,,,Chandler,,,
 Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes I'm gonna put it back (Mocking Ross) exactly where I found it.,,,Chandler,,,
 She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.,,,Chandler,,,
" She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.",,,Chandler,,,
" I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. (Picks up the phone and wipes it off) Phone's done ehh.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey Mon, how's it going?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.",,,Chandler,,,
 No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.,,,Chandler,,,
" It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! (To Ross) She's-she's gonna kill me.",,,Chandler,,,
" We should start with the big stuff. Y’know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. (He picks up one end and Ross doesn't help) I got it. (He moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)",,,Chandler,,,
" What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the...(Tries to rest his feet on the coffee table but they won't reach) OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.",,,Chandler,,,
" OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.",,,Chandler,,,
 That's not specific to girls.,,,Chandler,,,
 And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.,,,Chandler,,,
" Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, is this lamp in the same place?",,,Chandler,,,
 (blocks the door) No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.,,,Chandler,,,
 (to Ross) I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.",,,Chandler,,,
 Bye! Thank God,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.",,,Chandler,,,
 That's perfect! That's brilliant! (Starts going through the photo album),,,Chandler,,,
 Uh-huh,,,Chandler,,,
" No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. (Forced laughter)",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",,,Chandler,,,
 Do you want me to be afraid of you?,,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.,,,Chandler,,,
 Ba dum bumb cheshhh!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hi, my name’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?",,,Chandler,,,
" So, is Janine around?",,,Chandler,,,
 Can I check out what she did to my room?,,,Chandler,,,
" (The room is filled with flowers and a floral print sheet on the bed.) Oh my God. What is th… it’s like a guy never lived in here. Look, you’ve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. (Looking around the living room.) It’s spreading already.",,,Chandler,,,
" (Picking up a pillow.) Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?",,,Chandler,,,
" (Pointing to the table and picking up the box.) Is that your tiny little box, that’s too small to put anything in?",,,Chandler,,,
" No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes talk to her. Be a man.,,,Chandler,,,
 Defend yourself.,,,Chandler,,,
 Be right there sweetums. (Monica leaves. To Joey.) A totally different situation.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?",,,Chandler,,,
" Ohh, yeah.",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah let’s head off to work.,,,Chandler,,,
 You know…Oh My God.,,,Chandler,,,
 (Sarcastically) Really.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, what was wrong with your old…human teeth.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no no no. You’ll be fine. (turning to Monica) Hillary’s bind, right?",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. (Rachel walks in.),,,Chandler,,,
 What???,,,Chandler,,,
 I am proud of all my friends today.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hi, I’m Chandler. Your live-in boy",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish. (Phoebe walks in.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.",,,Chandler,,,
" Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.",,,Chandler,,,
 You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?,,,Chandler,,,
" No thanks, Josephine.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey Ross, I was wondering if… Oh my God!! Where are all the men???",,,Chandler,,,
" Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.",,,Chandler,,,
 What is the matter with you ?!?,,,Chandler,,,
" You’re arranging flowers! (Pointing to the dish on the table.) You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!",,,Chandler,,,
 You’re turning into a women.,,,Chandler,,,
 Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?,,,Chandler,,,
 Sidney Poitier? Hehheh.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!",,,Chandler,,,
 (shocked at the news) Why can’t I tell them that we live together?,,,Chandler,,,
 Why haven’t you told them?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Why wouldn’t they be happy?,,,Chandler,,,
 What? What? Why?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we’ll tell ‘em.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh, good, Ross! You’re parents like me, right?",,,Chandler,,,
 Well Monica just told me that they don’t.,,,Chandler,,,
 (annoyed) Do you know why?,,,Chandler,,,
 (angry) Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!,,,Chandler,,,
" This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.",,,Chandler,,,
 Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.,,,Chandler,,,
 [mocks that last comment].,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!",,,Chandler,,,
" Whoa, snowing out there?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.",,,Chandler,,,
 (worried) He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yes. Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I don’t mean tight, I mean it’s not too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]",,,Chandler,,,
 (shocked) What?,,,Chandler,,,
 You do? Why?,,,Chandler,,,
 What?! Why did you do that?,,,Chandler,,,
 How could it not matter?!,,,Chandler,,,
 What about all that “friends forever” stuff?,,,Chandler,,,
 Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!,,,Chandler,,,
" The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.",,,Chandler,,,
" (clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, that I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.",,,Chandler,,,
" (lying) Yes, but if it’s any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.",,,Chandler,,,
 Thank you!,,,Chandler,,,
 (In a parent-like tone) I’ll talk to them!,,,Chandler,,,
" Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.",,,Chandler,,,
" I dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me.",,,Chandler,,,
 See now it feels like Christmas!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Joe what’s up?,,,Chandler,,,
 I can see why that’s hard to resist.,,,Chandler,,,
" You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?",,,Chandler,,,
" Ah, you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you? (He kisses her on the cheek)",,,Chandler,,,
" What, what are you laughing at?",,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t think so.,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Rachel) Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
" I can save you time ladies, I’m right here.",,,Chandler,,,
 What? That’s terrible!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh well, that makes it not terrible.",,,Chandler,,,
" No not okay, you can’t look for Monica’s presents!",,,Chandler,,,
" No, you don’t have to, and you can’t because I live here too.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why?,,,Chandler,,,
" No, I have a great idea for a present for her.",,,Chandler,,,
" If I help, we can find ‘em faster!",,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?",,,Chandler,,,
" You don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?",,,Chandler,,,
" Because that’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I’ve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! (He does a weird clicky motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe.)",,,Chandler,,,
" I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!",,,Chandler,,,
" Those are my gifts, I got them for you.",,,Chandler,,,
 Those are book ends! That's a great gift!,,,Chandler,,,
" Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, hey guys!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh great!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay! Okay! Okay!,,,Chandler,,,
" Wait, we can’t do this.",,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean, look, I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.",,,Chandler,,,
" Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don’t know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present, and I’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?",,,Chandler,,,
 Fine!,,,Chandler,,,
 That’s what you got me?,,,Chandler,,,
" Now you do that, you’re on TV.",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s great!,,,Chandler,,,
" So you kissed her, so what happened after that?",,,Chandler,,,
 So she’s just waiting over there for ya?,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff. (Hands her all of her bills and stuff.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I’m not your garbage man. I’m your mailman.,,,Chandler,,,
 A pharmacist. (Rachel mocks him.),,,Chandler,,,
 You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!,,,Chandler,,,
 You made pottery?,,,Chandler,,,
" Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore…",,,Chandler,,,
" …so then the farmer says, ""That’s not a cow and you’re not milking it."" (Everyone laughs.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Look at us, we’re a couple of couples!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah all right. (They part.) Okay, good night guys.",,,Chandler,,,
" And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Hands it to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn’t afford it, because you paid dinner last night.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh that’s too bad.,,,Chandler,,,
" That’s funny, I saw no phlegm.",,,Chandler,,,
 Then why-why is she going to a play?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!",,,Chandler,,,
 So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!,,,Chandler,,,
" And I am not blah, I am a hoot!",,,Chandler,,,
" No, you sh—No you said you made that up!!",,,Chandler,,,
" Eh, they’re both good. I generally just go with, Monica’s drunk again. (Monica glares at him.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, one more time.",,,Chandler,,,
 Perfect decibel.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh nothing, we’re just talking. Y’know, blah-blah-blah.",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s totally understandable.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yeah!,,,Chandler,,,
" And I’m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) ""Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment.""",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) Y’know I think you can take her.,,,Chandler,,,
 Did you hear that?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I’m sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey so, did uh, did she move out?",,,Chandler,,,
 You okay?,,,Chandler,,,
 That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.,,,Chandler,,,
 I made that joke up.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he’d ever heard.",,,Chandler,,,
" Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?",,,Chandler,,,
 Seriously?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I guess.",,,Chandler,,,
" (jumping up from his chair) Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.",,,Chandler,,,
 It’s my joke.,,,Chandler,,,
" Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.",,,Chandler,,,
" Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’t want to miss when they were skinny.",,,Chandler,,,
" What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and the screen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?",,,Chandler,,,
" Joey, why is your cable out?",,,Chandler,,,
" If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?",,,Chandler,,,
 Whoa ho.,,,Chandler,,,
" (picks up the phone) All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?",,,Chandler,,,
" (with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phone bill?",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
" So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.",,,Chandler,,,
 And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.,,,Chandler,,,
" (stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.",,,Chandler,,,
" So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay (he goes to sit down).,,,Chandler,,,
" (visibly upset) He took my joke, he took it.",,,Chandler,,,
" You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah!,,,Chandler,,,
 Picking Rachel.,,,Chandler,,,
 Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.,,,Chandler,,,
 So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.,,,Chandler,,,
" I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to make a lot of money, and here’s your first tip: Don’t eat yellow snow. (He laughs, then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.",,,Chandler,,,
 It’s my joke.,,,Chandler,,,
 Let’s have Monica decide.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah!,,,Chandler,,,
" Mon, get out here!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.",,,Chandler,,,
 Because you’re the only one that can be fair.,,,Chandler,,,
" (to Ross) Don’t try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) I’m your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.",,,Chandler,,,
 Can I finish my story?!,,,Chandler,,,
" So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’s doctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his point.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I’m not arguing with that.,,,Chandler,,,
 Is not.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hi, oh hi.",,,Chandler,,,
" (starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and—(He falters and Monica prompts him.)—generosity of spirit.",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Chandler) I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?,,,Chandler,,,
 (pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You’re a little high maintenance.,,,Chandler,,,
" I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like … maintaining you.",,,Chandler,,,
 (happily) I’m off the list. (Sits on the couch.),,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. I’m not answering that.,,,Chandler,,,
 This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work?",,,Chandler,,,
 I’m so sorry you’re sick.,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m gonna grab you some tissue.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh my God, introduce us!",,,Chandler,,,
 Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (Rachel glares at him.),,,Chandler,,,
" I know, let’s rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass of orange juice.)",,,Chandler,,,
 That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippy here. (Points to his nose.),,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy.",,,Chandler,,,
 Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just can’t have s*x with a sick person.,,,Chandler,,,
" That’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? (He gets up from the couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica, still in the robe, lying seductively on the bed. Or at least she’s trying too and as he enters the room, she takes the robe off on of her legs.) Oh-ohhhh!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.",,,Chandler,,,
 I was asleep. (She takes off her robe and starts to shiver) Oh no! No-no honey! Y’know what’s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.,,,Chandler,,,
 Would you please get some rest!,,,Chandler,,,
 Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!,,,Chandler,,,
" No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.",,,Chandler,,,
 No-no-no-no-no!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" So you’re just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?",,,Chandler,,,
 It’s nice.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes! (Hangs his head in shame.),,,Chandler,,,
" It’s all very, very good. (She covers up and sits down.) So you wanna go uh, mix it up?",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh come on you big faker!,,,Chandler,,,
 Well that was before all the vaporizing action.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay! (Runs into the bedroom.),,,Chandler,,,
 (calling from the bathroom) What are you doing here?,,,Chandler,,,
 We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.,,,Chandler,,,
 He’s taking off her coat!,,,Chandler,,,
" Ho-oh, he’s gonna get some! (Rachel looks at him.) Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y’know so umm, he’s closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. (Pause) Well, I’m off to bed! (Goes to bed.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I’m good.,,,Chandler,,,
 (looking) Is that a swing?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yuck!,,,Chandler,,,
 That was like 5 years ago.,,,Chandler,,,
 Joey…,,,Chandler,,,
" (totally not crying) Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m not macho.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, I guess I just never really cried. Y’know? I’m not a crying kind of guy.",,,Chandler,,,
" I’d be sad sure, but I wouldn’t cry.",,,Chandler,,,
" Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I’m rich!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, that’s Parent’s Day, first grade. That’s me with the janitor Martin.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh they didn’t want to come!,,,Chandler,,,
" No! Look, I don’t cry! It’s not a big deal! Okay?!",,,Chandler,,,
 You didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?,,,Chandler,,,
 Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do p0rn.",,,Chandler,,,
 Her ankle is what you’re watching?,,,Chandler,,,
 She’s just doing her job!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the couch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)",,,Chandler,,,
 There’s no back to this couch!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead inside.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we’re up at the altar and I’m like this. (Makes a bored face.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then.",,,Chandler,,,
" Aww, I love you so…",,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
 So you didn’t mean any of that?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) Maybe we should give them some privacy.,,,Chandler,,,
 (crying hysterically) I just don’t see why those two can’t work things out!,,,Chandler,,,
" (starts crying) I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone. (They all look at him.) I can’t help it, I opened a gate.",,,Chandler,,,
 Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Sure I would!,,,Chandler,,,
" What, you guys really think that I’m that shallow?",,,Chandler,,,
" What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job’s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don’t have to wear a tie.",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering, depressed) Hey.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not ""Archie Comic funny.""",,,Chandler,,,
 Was his question what’s more boring than him?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.",,,Chandler,,,
 Ehh.,,,Chandler,,,
 I could use the money; it could give me time to write.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay!,,,Chandler,,,
 All right!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Well it’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real.,,,Chandler,,,
" Uh-oh, it’s my boss!",,,Chandler,,,
 (reading the list) Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 But the Kit-Kats are all right?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!",,,Chandler,,,
" I always thought having a heart attack was nature’s way of telling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But you’re not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you’re not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, ""Bring me food."" Two is, ""I’m with a girl, bring us food."" Three is, ""I’m lost and I can’t find food.""",,,Chandler,,,
" (approaching) Here you go Joe, here’s the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. (Hands it to him.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
" I’m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, anything for you sir?",,,Chandler,,,
 It’s not all juice! (Rachel quickly gets out of the way.),,,Chandler,,,
 Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Aww.,,,Chandler,,,
 You wanna share it?,,,Chandler,,,
 What’s this?,,,Chandler,,,
" Aww, thanks man. (They hug.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh you wouldn’t uh, care. It’s just a stupid comic book story.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy (Joey laughs), uh but he doesn’t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist—as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can’t have lumps in them.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, the doctors say it may kill her.",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Ross) But I think we should tell her.,,,Chandler,,,
" Listen Phoebe, he’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, what about y’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.",,,Chandler,,,
 I’m sorry you’re here with me instead of Roger.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I could make it seem like he’s here. (Imitates him.) ""Here’s some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn’t add the second cous until 1979."" (Mumbles something further.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 What was tonight?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?,,,Chandler,,,
 With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica shrugs.) Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
 Four different women! I’ve had s*x way more times!,,,Chandler,,,
 Nine.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey that’s what I tell girls about me.,,,Chandler,,,
 No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (They both realize what he just said.),,,Chandler,,,
 So was I.,,,Chandler,,,
 We can’t do this.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldn’t want to disappoint you.",,,Chandler,,,
 I do like that.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?",,,Chandler,,,
 Stop it! We’re doing this! Let’s do it!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay! (They both get up.),,,Chandler,,,
 I have some moves.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, let’s just forget it.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 (sexily) Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, okay! (He rolls over to do that again.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!,,,Chandler,,,
" So you uh, want to do something tonight?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you’re still seeing him and uh, he’s a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when… (He fakes falling asleep.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?",,,Chandler,,,
 I bet he can.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah! Yeah! Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine! (Does a kara-tay move.)",,,Chandler,,,
 (sticking his head in the door) Okay to come in?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?",,,Chandler,,,
 I’m the ruptured spleen. (Laughs.),,,Chandler,,,
 Because you shouldn’t be with him. (Pause.) You should be with me.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don’t just happen. Y’know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y’know I was just lying there and I couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y’know with a friend.",,,Chandler,,,
" I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a ""doctor…""",,,Chandler,,,
" No, there were two.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.,,,Chandler,,,
 I see where you’re goin’!,,,Chandler,,,
" (reminiscing) Ah, finally an explanation.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey-hey, is Monica here?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her for Valentine’s Day.",,,Chandler,,,
 (laughs) She was working on Valentine’s Day so we’re celebrating it tonight.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and her brother, (the camera pans to Ross flashing Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared) I can’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.",,,Chandler,,,
 I made a… (Does one of those gibberish words.),,,Chandler,,,
 Nothing!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?",,,Chandler,,,
" (admiring his work) This, this actually is a… (Does the same gibberish word from before.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Day gifts?",,,Chandler,,,
 Do we have to make the entire thing?,,,Chandler,,,
" Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.",,,Chandler,,,
 (sticking his head back in) What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?",,,Chandler,,,
 I can’t figure out what to make Monica.,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.",,,Chandler,,,
" Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her.",,,Chandler,,,
" Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay. Okay. (He goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way, and notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Then he holds it out as if he’s giving it to her.) Yes honey, I made it myself. (He throws it down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a pair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he just removed.) I can’t do it. I can’t do it. (He throws them both down and continues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!! (He runs out into the living room.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, come here! Come here.",,,Chandler,,,
" Now, it’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it.",,,Chandler,,,
 But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.,,,Chandler,,,
 (momentarily terrified) Maybe we’ll have to listen and see!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah!,,,Chandler,,,
 It’s a sock bunny.,,,Chandler,,,
 Not really.,,,Chandler,,,
" I see. Y’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, it’s okay. I don’t…",,,Chandler,,,
" (thinking it over) Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. (They both run into the bedroom.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.) You are way to young to have seen that!,,,Chandler,,,
 You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah! (Takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.),,,Chandler,,,
 You have done enough!,,,Chandler,,,
" No you don’t—get it in black, not brown.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oop!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it’s like that old saying, have some s*x, eat some cake.",,,Chandler,,,
 Who the hell is Carl?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren’t they?",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my good God.,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, the mixed tape.",,,Chandler,,,
 No! You’re the sweetest! (He tries to kiss her but Monica backs away with a look that could kill on her face.),,,Chandler,,,
" I am so, so, so, so sorry!",,,Chandler,,,
" And I will cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and do anything in there! (Points to the bedroom.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Come on Monica, it’s our Valentine’s Day. Please? Please-please, please?",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (They hug.),,,Chandler,,,
" So, are we going in there?",,,Chandler,,,
" Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there’s a big selling calendar, eh?",,,Chandler,,,
 A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, is that against the rules?",,,Chandler,,,
 I see.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like ten years.",,,Chandler,,,
" You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred…",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh okay, I’ll-I’ll try.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah so, Tuesday?",,,Chandler,,,
 (sarcastically) Thank you.,,,Chandler,,,
 You just thought of that in there?,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you smiling about? What is so funny?,,,Chandler,,,
 How’s your room Rach?,,,Chandler,,,
 Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?,,,Chandler,,,
" God, it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long it’s been!",,,Chandler,,,
 (on phone) Oh that’s great! Good for you.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm… (Joey mimes throwing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven and cutting it.) Can you hold for one second please? (To Joey) What?!",,,Chandler,,,
" (on phone) Hi! I’m back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah, that sounds great. (Listens) Okay. Well, we’ll do it then. (Listens) Okay, bye-bye. (He hangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi.,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Joey) We didn’t get to the audition. I’m gonna take her to coffee and then we’ll do it then.,,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years! You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, we only went out once.",,,Chandler,,,
 Not once!,,,Chandler,,,
" (laughs) Oh that’s great, my friend Joey’s in the movie business.",,,Chandler,,,
 (giggles) My friend’s name is Joey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie.",,,Chandler,,,
 The nerve huh?,,,Chandler,,,
 Refill?,,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 I couldn’t do it.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, Dana Keystone from college.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, that was Dana Caplin.",,,Chandler,,,
 Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no!",,,Chandler,,,
 No-no—Really?!,,,Chandler,,,
" (breaking up) Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh…",,,Chandler,,,
 Well maybe there is one thing you can do.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later. (He runs off and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering, sees Rachel’s throw) Ni-hi-ice!",,,Chandler,,,
" (To Joey) So, you busy Thursday?",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. Okay. (Joey puts him down.) What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?,,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
 No! No! No! I was so careful! (Runs out.),,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 So?!,,,Chandler,,,
 It’s Thursday! How was the audition?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. (Pats Joey’s arm, Joey pats Chandler’s shoulder, and Chandler motions for Joey to say the same about him.)",,,Chandler,,,
 So he has to be a male who has at least $50.,,,Chandler,,,
 (laughs) Isn’t she cute? (On Monica’s death stare) No!,,,Chandler,,,
" So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, tell her good luck with that.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh that’s so funny because we found someone too.,,,Chandler,,,
 Why would our guy be a weirdo?,,,Chandler,,,
 A face ass?,,,Chandler,,,
" No, our guy is just a floating head.",,,Chandler,,,
 (horrified) Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.,,,Chandler,,,
 Our guy has great hair.,,,Chandler,,,
 Our guy smells incredible.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you…don’t look good Joe.",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s still in there?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Is this a service you’re providing me?,,,Chandler,,,
 Our new fridge? I don’t live here anymore.,,,Chandler,,,
 Uh-huh.,,,Chandler,,,
 (not quite sure where Joey’s going and is a little worried) Okay…,,,Chandler,,,
 Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready.,,,Chandler,,,
 Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.,,,Chandler,,,
" Joey, I saw you push him!",,,Chandler,,,
 Uh-huh.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.)",,,Chandler,,,
" I can see it now, ""Look dad, it’s the Sphinx!"" (Does that party noise again.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you funny?,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat’s name?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, so you will meet our guys?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose, y’know? It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.",,,Chandler,,,
" (To Ross) Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?",,,Chandler,,,
 You know the hotels?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, maybe you don’t marry this one.",,,Chandler,,,
 Good-good-good-good.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y’know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad come here! (He stands up from the next table.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Eldad, sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!",,,Chandler,,,
 There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler),,,Chandler,,,
" Hi. (To Phoebe) Okay, you’re too late okay? Because she’s already with our guy.",,,Chandler,,,
 It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.),,,Chandler,,,
 (To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To Eldad) You dance for Rachel!,,,Chandler,,,
 So what was it for anyway?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
" (To Joey) So uh, what’s this thing you’re auditioning for?",,,Chandler,,,
 That is lucky.,,,Chandler,,,
" Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?",,,Chandler,,,
"  Whoa, she's pretty. (Mentioning the girl on TV)",,,Chandler,,,
"  Oh, ok.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, are we playing this?!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! How’d the audition go?,,,Chandler,,,
 So it did go well.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh that’s great!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh-oh, what are you doing?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it is overdue.",,,Chandler,,,
" (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh come on guys, it’s not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren’t for (struggles to get this out) Monica’s allergies. (The duck quacks.) You’re right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. (The phone rings.) Should I get that? (Laughs, then answers the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Uh no, Joey’s not here right now. Can I take a message? (Listens) Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? (Listens) Okay great. (Listens.) Bye. (Hangs up the phone and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle on the door but Monica walks in and forces him to jump out of the way.)",,,Chandler,,,
 (looks down at his clothes) Am I naked again?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh right, your allergies. (Monica leaves and to the chick and duck) All her, she hates you. (Chandler leaves without finishing the message for Joey.)",,,Chandler,,,
 As crazy as soccer?,,,Chandler,,,
 You mean you didn’t get it from this?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!",,,Chandler,,,
" I messed up. Okay? I’m sorry, I really messed up.",,,Chandler,,,
" Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody’s allowed one mistake, right?",,,Chandler,,,
"  You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller!  The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!",,,Chandler,,,
"  Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]",,,Chandler,,,
"  I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi!",,,Chandler,,,
"  Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…",,,Chandler,,,
  No! No! No! I just kissed her.,,,Chandler,,,
  How is that worse?!,,,Chandler,,,
"  You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too!",,,Chandler,,,
 (lets him out) What happened?!!,,,Chandler,,,
  What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!,,,Chandler,,,
  So--You got in voluntarily?!,,,Chandler,,,
  BEND OVER?!!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.",,,Chandler,,,
 ...And what did you bring?,,,Chandler,,,
 Janice?,,,Chandler,,,
 Janice?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh come on!  He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...",,,Chandler,,,
 Cupping.,,,Chandler,,,
 I can’t believe I did this! What an idiot!,,,Chandler,,,
 Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?,,,Chandler,,,
 Y’know what? I-I kinda have.,,,Chandler,,,
" You didn’t see how mad he was, y’know?",,,Chandler,,,
 (coming out from behind the door) I KNEW IT!!!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God! ,,,Chandler,,,
" Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? (The phone rings and he answers it) (On phone) Hello? (Takes the phone away from his mouth when he realizes what he just did and yells.) Damnit! (Back on phone.) Hello? (Listens.) No, Joey’s not here right now, but I can take a message I think. (Listens) He’s still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that’s great news! (Listens) Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. (Listens) Oh well, that’s great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! (Hangs up and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle.) Yes! (Reading what he’s writing) Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. (Pause) By dog not flowers.",,,Chandler,,,
 Please tell me you got the message!,,,Chandler,,,
" The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o’clock.",,,Chandler,,,
" Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross’s! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!",,,Chandler,,,
 Sorry! I-I-I don’t know what to say.,,,Chandler,,,
 (angrily) Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!",,,Chandler,,,
 Well that’s good. Because you didn’t! And I’m incredibly happy for ya!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, we could do this all day.",,,Chandler,,,
 You are gonna be a huge star! I’m gonna hug ya!,,,Chandler,,,
 All right!,,,Chandler,,,
" I think so. Yeah, get off me.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" (To Monica) Oh, well thank you in advance. (Kisses her.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you judging them by their covers? Because you’re really not supposed to do that.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not Elizabeth’s dad?!",,,Chandler,,,
 Ross!,,,Chandler,,,
 There’s a Mr. Bing!,,,Chandler,,,
" But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story… (He starts laughing then notices that Paul isn’t happy.) You’re roommate in college died didn’t he?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, we were just…",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, the little girl creeps me out.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why would the baby creep me out?,,,Chandler,,,
 This is going in your book?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Damn those robots, they’re supposed to be our faithful servants!",,,Chandler,,,
" So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, you wish. (Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Who?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hmm.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh-oh.,,,Chandler,,,
 We said seven!,,,Chandler,,,
" The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my good God.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
 (disgusted) What does it say?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (He’s wearing a reddish-orange sweater.),,,Chandler,,,
 So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hi, how are ya?",,,Chandler,,,
 (whispering in Joey’s ear) The reason he just said.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I’ve been there my friend.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 I’ll give up my ticket.,,,Chandler,,,
 And I think Ross is generous too.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Ross.,,,Chandler,,,
" (on machine) You’ve reached Monica and Chandler’s, if you’re listening to this message, we’re probably screening. (to himself) Yeah we are.",,,Chandler,,,
" (on phone) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (Listens) Yes, the groom—No! Not the groom!!",,,Chandler,,,
 (gets up) See you later. (Starts to leave.),,,Chandler,,,
 (angrily) Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! (He storms out.),,,Chandler,,,
 (on machine) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (The machine beeps off.),,,Chandler,,,
" I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one of those Chandler noises.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Right here! (Clucks like a chicken for some reason.),,,Chandler,,,
" Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that I’m just not ready…",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (They hug.),,,Chandler,,,
 Totally.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, it’s beautiful.",,,Chandler,,,
 I know.,,,Chandler,,,
" Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page) Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!",,,Chandler,,,
" No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",,,Chandler,,,
 Me too.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh all right.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.",,,Chandler,,,
 Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too and I can’t find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and starts pointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers is watching him.) It’s a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.),,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I’m gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another display counter.) Oh, this one’s nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.",,,Chandler,,,
" Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?",,,Chandler,,,
" (choking up) Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How much is it?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, credit card. (Reaches for it then realizes) Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. (To Phoebe) Okay, I’ll go get it. You guard the ring.",,,Chandler,,,
 No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.),,,Chandler,,,
" No, did he hug you?!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m a little busy here Paul.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. (Paul rushes over and hugs Chandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay! (Pushes him away.),,,Chandler,,,
 Do you have my credit card?,,,Chandler,,,
 Thank God! (Grabs his card.),,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I can’t go.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 They put you in jail?,,,Chandler,,,
" Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.,,,Chandler,,,
 It was the ring!,,,Chandler,,,
 I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!,,,Chandler,,,
" No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look, this is the most important thing I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.",,,Chandler,,,
 I can’t do that.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.",,,Chandler,,,
" (to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I’m gonna need to have that back. (The guy isn’t sure.) But, in exchange I’m willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew.",,,Chandler,,,
 No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring. You don’t want to break her heart now do you?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, she’s dying… Of a cough apparently.",,,Chandler,,,
" (interrupting her) Okay, that’s enough honey!",,,Chandler,,,
" Great! Okay, here. (Holds the ring up for him.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And you are about to marry a wonderful man! (She stunned and he’s horrified.) Hey! I’m marrying a dead woman!,,,Chandler,,,
" Guys? (They ignore him.) I’ve got something important to tell ya. (Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to try and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yep, pretty much.",,,Chandler,,,
 (goes to hug him and stops short) Heyyyy—What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait ‘til uh, it was official y’know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you’re my best friends.",,,Chandler,,,
 I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.,,,Chandler,,,
 I know.,,,Chandler,,,
 Check out the ring.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the game on TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, well tonight’s the big night.",,,Chandler,,,
" It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I’m just gonna propose.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m not gonna mess it up.,,,Chandler,,,
 She’s not gonna say no.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Phoebe) Give me it!,,,Chandler,,,
 Phoebe!,,,Chandler,,,
 (with his mouthful) Hi Monica.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" (glaring at her) Well, Monica and Chandler can’t go. We’re going to dinner remember?!",,,Chandler,,,
 I just get mad when Rachel doesn’t remember where we’re going.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, so you’re already doing your part for the kids.",,,Chandler,,,
" Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn’t agree to that!",,,Chandler,,,
" Will you marry me? Will you marry me? (Makes like a gun with his fingers.) Hey, you marry me! (He gives up as Joey, Rachel, Phoebe, and Ross slink in all excited.) What’s going on little elves?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, right here in my pocket. (Pats his pocket. Phoebe smiles, goes over to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.) Pheebs?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she’s gonna know.",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) You look beautiful.,,,Chandler,,,
" (trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (It’s a butchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign friends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes! Yes! I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no you can’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should’ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes! I’m fine. In fact I’ve been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn’t imagine growing old with…",,,Chandler,,,
" (not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just let me say it.",,,Chandler,,,
" What?! I’m Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway, Chandler turns and looks) Oh, that’s Richard!",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey-hey, hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I don’t know why I did that!",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Richard’s date) And uh, you don’t have a mustache which is good. (She just smiles.) I’m Chandler; I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi.,,,Chandler,,,
" Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at him.) See I, did it again.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I’ll sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes. (Thinking he’s gone.),,,Chandler,,,
" I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
" (stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!",,,Chandler,,,
 Richard!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh you knew that. Good!,,,Chandler,,,
 For camp!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re not careful you may not get married at all this year!",,,Chandler,,,
 (after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Richard was there so I couldn’t do it!,,,Chandler,,,
" I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, but now you’ve ruined it!",,,Chandler,,,
 Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!,,,Chandler,,,
 This is terrible. What am I going to do?,,,Chandler,,,
" That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.",,,Chandler,,,
" I can do that, I’ve had 30 years of practice.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, okay, here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.) Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?",,,Chandler,,,
 Eh…,,,Chandler,,,
" Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!",,,Chandler,,,
" If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.",,,Chandler,,,
 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!,,,Chandler,,,
" (to them) It’s okay, I got a plan.",,,Chandler,,,
 I was making a coconut phone with the professor.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
 My—Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
 He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m supposed to do that!,,,Chandler,,,
 Well what… Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna go over there; I’m gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!,,,Chandler,,,
 You’re right.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) I’m gonna get the ring! I’m gonna get the ring! (Does so) I’m gonna go find her and (starts running for the door) I’m just going to propose!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay great.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Where is she? I’m not scared of you! (Averts his eyes and walks in.),,,Chandler,,,
" (examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!",,,Chandler,,,
 Well where did she go?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh my God, I can’t believe this! Y’know, I thought…I thought you were a good guy.",,,Chandler,,,
 Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?,,,Chandler,,,
 Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!,,,Chandler,,,
 And what does she have to think about? I love her!,,,Chandler,,,
" But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she’d be surprised!",,,Chandler,,,
" It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (Sits down heavily.) I was gonna propose tonight.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Did you get a ring?,,,Chandler,,,
 Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.,,,Chandler,,,
" I can’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you talking about?,,,Chandler,,,
 Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Well where… Where did she go?,,,Chandler,,,
 I can’t believe I ruined this.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought… (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Monica and I are engaged.,,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks.,,,Chandler,,,
" (To Ross) Okay, you get her in here. (To Joey) You bolt the door. I’ll be in the closet.",,,Chandler,,,
" It’s okay, I want this to be your night too. (Raises his class.) To Monica.",,,Chandler,,,
 To Monica!,,,Chandler,,,
" So when you said, ""Get up early,"" did you mean 1986?",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Know what I mean?,,,Chandler,,,
 There’s gonna be a wedding. You’re gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.,,,Chandler,,,
" (motioning with his hands) I’m not worried, I’m uh, I’m fascinated. Y’know it’s like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her room with her guitar.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Sure, you guys don’t have this problem, you’re made of wood. (Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!",,,Chandler,,,
 You look great!,,,Chandler,,,
 You okay over there?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, don’t worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.",,,Chandler,,,
" (putting his hands up) Take whatever you want, just please don’t hurt me.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.",,,Chandler,,,
" Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!",,,Chandler,,,
 Joe?,,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, you’ve had a lot of s*x right?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to—I mean I really wanted to, but I couldn’t…. There huh—hmm, there-there was an incident.",,,Chandler,,,
 It’s happened to you?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, what’d you do?",,,Chandler,,,
 (angrily) I don’t think that’s what they were talking about Joe!!,,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, you can pass for 19.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes!,,,Chandler,,,
" Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!",,,Chandler,,,
" Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there’s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.",,,Chandler,,,
 We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).,,,Chandler,,,
" Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it’s romantic, but because I can!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away.",,,Chandler,,,
" It’s Paris, who knows we’re here!",,,Chandler,,,
" Pheebs, we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!",,,Chandler,,,
" What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Ahh, third base.",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)",,,Chandler,,,
 How is that ever going to happen?!,,,Chandler,,,
" (To Ross) I don’t care, she slept with me.",,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks.,,,Chandler,,,
" (interrupting her just in time) Hey! Here’s a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (Goes back to bed.),,,Chandler,,,
 What’s the matter honey?,,,Chandler,,,
 (incredulous) Already?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I got some thoughts on that.",,,Chandler,,,
 What in God’s name is that?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t play anymore and Derrick… (Off of Rachel and Monica’s looks) And Derrick is a name I shouldn’t know.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?,,,Chandler,,,
" Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Centerpieces!,,,Chandler,,,
" Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I just think they’re a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.) But Lilies are the clear choice.",,,Chandler,,,
 Uh-huh!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, I should probably call them.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story.",,,Chandler,,,
 What a sweet story.,,,Chandler,,,
 Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. (Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.),,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to (Pause) Dollywood.",,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, it’s gonna be okay.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we’re gonna get married.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I have some.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, close to… (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, come on, I’ve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, I am!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Ehh.,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I thought about it too, and I’m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do.",,,Chandler,,,
" Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.",,,Chandler,,,
 Sure you do.,,,Chandler,,,
 You sure?,,,Chandler,,,
 I love you so much.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, totally!",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, you guys!",,,Chandler,,,
" So, what do you think?",,,Chandler,,,
" Are you kidding? Okay, I’ll give you a hint; I’ll give you a hint. (Points to his glasses.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I got glasses!,,,Chandler,,,
 No I didn’t!,,,Chandler,,,
 No!,,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
" (sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didn’t think I used to wear glasses, right?",,,Chandler,,,
" That’s okay Pheebs, we’re not having a party or anything, so you don’t have to get us…",,,Chandler,,,
 What we want honey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Dying people say the craziest things.,,,Chandler,,,
 Our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! How’s the boat?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that.",,,Chandler,,,
 Do you know what I was thinkin’?,,,Chandler,,,
" Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Uh why, do you have a lecture?",,,Chandler,,,
 Then free as a bird. What’s up?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, did-did you correct him?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand.",,,Chandler,,,
 Does anybody know me?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Don’t worry about it Pheebs.,,,Chandler,,,
 An old cookie?,,,Chandler,,,
 We can’t accept this.,,,Chandler,,,
 ‘Cause it’s gross.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, we owe you a present.",,,Chandler,,,
 I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.,,,Chandler,,,
" Daddy. All right look, here’s the story. (Flashback to Chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam-filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and that’s when it happened.",,,Chandler,,,
 Guys?,,,Chandler,,,
 I know.,,,Chandler,,,
 Why do they put so much steam in there?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?,,,Chandler,,,
 Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things.,,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t want him to tell this story for years.,,,Chandler,,,
 If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!,,,Chandler,,,
" (getting up) All right, I’m off to see your dad.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face—And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass. (Exits.)",,,Chandler,,,
" So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little…I’m a little embarrassed about it.",,,Chandler,,,
 What did you do when they found out?,,,Chandler,,,
 So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!,,,Chandler,,,
 It’s your mommy. It’s your mommy.,,,Chandler,,,
 That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.,,,Chandler,,,
 And say nothing?,,,Chandler,,,
 No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.),,,Chandler,,,
" Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?",,,Chandler,,,
 Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.,,,Chandler,,,
" No I’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no-no, I can’t do that.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs hysterically.) So what was Phoebe’s secret?",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?,,,Chandler,,,
 (angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!,,,Chandler,,,
 What about him?,,,Chandler,,,
 Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow! Don’t show this to Monica! And don’t tell her about the W-H-Wow!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh it’s always nicer to hear than, ""Aw crap! You again!""",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
 Did you not understand the story?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! What’s up?,,,Chandler,,,
 Huh.,,,Chandler,,,
 No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!,,,Chandler,,,
 Nancy Thompson’s getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the shoulder.),,,Chandler,,,
 I had to okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!,,,Chandler,,,
 Du-ude!,,,Chandler,,,
" Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!""",,,Chandler,,,
" In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?",,,Chandler,,,
" You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!",,,Chandler,,,
 Ross came in fourth and cried!,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) Wow—whoa!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!!!,,,Chandler,,,
 That was you!,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?,,,Chandler,,,
 Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.),,,Chandler,,,
 Y’know when I said that because we’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah that was stupid. Let’s not do that.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn’t hang out with…all the guys in my office.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you guys doing?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this… (Makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. Henceforth, this shall be known as The Face.)",,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t know what it is, I just can’t take a good picture.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I’m not in that.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, but I should warn you, I’m not going. I’m going. (Does The Face while saying that last part.)",,,Chandler,,,
 How about those three-pointers?,,,Chandler,,,
" And those guys were this (Doing the standard ""This Close"" gesture) close to lettin’ us play this time too.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.",,,Chandler,,,
 They have that on the napkins at the club.,,,Chandler,,,
" Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y’know you can’t date him right?",,,Chandler,,,
 Dude that is so sad.,,,Chandler,,,
 Could I play?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (Does The Face.),,,Chandler,,,
" No, I am.",,,Chandler,,,
" I do? (He smiles, beautifully.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay. (You’ll have to see it, I can’t describe the face he makes, but it isn’t good.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Aww! (Smiles.),,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?,,,Chandler,,,
 I can’t help it!,,,Chandler,,,
 Borrow money from me?,,,Chandler,,,
 Why is there jelly on your shoe?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 (Pause) I’m right here!,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m still right here!,,,Chandler,,,
" Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?",,,Chandler,,,
 Can you people not see me?! (He waves his arms around to get their attention.),,,Chandler,,,
 There I am!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!",,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t know, but don’t worry, don’t worry, because I know how to take a picture now. (They get ready) Okay, see? Look down (Looks down), look down, look down… (He falls asleep.)",,,Chandler,,,
 (awakens) Yeah! (Looks up and does The Face.),,,Chandler,,,
 Ahhh.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, that looks good.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m marrying her.,,,Chandler,,,
 Die Hard still great!,,,Chandler,,,
 What’d you rent?,,,Chandler,,,
" (looking at the tape) Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s sweet.,,,Chandler,,,
" So uh, what did this woman look like?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive… (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, let’s see… (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is that her? (Pointing to the picture.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.",,,Chandler,,,
" (pause) No, we’re still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…",,,Chandler,,,
" I did not say fat! I said, ""Fa-aa-aw-ow…""",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not amused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me.",,,Chandler,,,
 Can you figure out what I’m doing?,,,Chandler,,,
 Who?,,,Chandler,,,
 Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!,,,Chandler,,,
 What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you fell in love with!",,,Chandler,,,
" (she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.",,,Chandler,,,
" (To Monica) It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.",,,Chandler,,,
" You-you-you didn’t know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, I guess my work here is done!",,,Chandler,,,
" As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.",,,Chandler,,,
 I would really love it if I could do both.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
 A hundred and forty-five pounds.,,,Chandler,,,
" Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.",,,Chandler,,,
 You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!,,,Chandler,,,
" Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.",,,Chandler,,,
 So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.,,,Chandler,,,
 I’d carry you around in my pocket.,,,Chandler,,,
 Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.,,,Chandler,,,
 …Come on! Why are we here?!,,,Chandler,,,
 The hot chicks?,,,Chandler,,,
 Wow that’s actually pretty cool.,,,Chandler,,,
 Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.,,,Chandler,,,
" You didn’t bring me here to do that, did you?",,,Chandler,,,
" OH…MY…GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn’t tell her we were getting married, did you?",,,Chandler,,,
 Did she freak out?,,,Chandler,,,
 Right.,,,Chandler,,,
" (laughs) You said no, right?",,,Chandler,,,
" You said no, right?!",,,Chandler,,,
" Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check’s in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can’t wait to read your book, Ross!!",,,Chandler,,,
" What do you think, she’s just gonna sit there quietly? You don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!",,,Chandler,,,
 Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what? She’s probably not gonna even want to come.,,,Chandler,,,
 No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes!!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We’re not even sure why we’re having it.",,,Chandler,,,
 I say we go with Careless Whisper.,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?,,,Chandler,,,
 Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?,,,Chandler,,,
" No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!",,,Chandler,,,
 Is that what you’re thinking about right now?,,,Chandler,,,
" Janice, I’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight.",,,Chandler,,,
" Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.",,,Chandler,,,
 Say again?,,,Chandler,,,
" Feelings, such strong feelings.",,,Chandler,,,
 I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.),,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, no. No-no-no.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.",,,Chandler,,,
" Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica).",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, okay, time's up!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, Joey?",,,Chandler,,,
 Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list) There you go.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up Ross' pad),,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)",,,Chandler,,,
" I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up!",,,Chandler,,,
" Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, but if you can't…no dinner!",,,Chandler,,,
" Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.",,,Chandler,,,
 I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.,,,Chandler,,,
 Which smells delicious!,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!",,,Chandler,,,
 Huh! Where is the dog?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!",,,Chandler,,,
 What is it doing here?,,,Chandler,,,
" Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!",,,Chandler,,,
 (gasping) Really?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it still has to go, right?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, it's um…",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say, ""Do what you have to do"") Okay, I hate dogs.",,,Chandler,,,
" They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.",,,Chandler,,,
 (scared) Is there a puppy here?,,,Chandler,,,
" (to Tag) Okay, you are new!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.",,,Chandler,,,
" And I don't wanna say this, I don't want you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An awkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!",,,Chandler,,,
 (comes out of the bathroom) Here I am.,,,Chandler,,,
 How did you…know? (Heads back into the bathroom),,,Chandler,,,
 (comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica?,,,Chandler,,,
 Why not?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I, I should go in there.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why not?,,,Chandler,,,
 This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom),,,Chandler,,,
" Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?",,,Chandler,,,
 And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out),,,Chandler,,,
" No, no he went for a walk.",,,Chandler,,,
" Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y’know, for you, and…(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then over to the street)",,,Chandler,,,
 Clunkers?! Oh my god!,,,Chandler,,,
 (to Clunkers) It is so good to see you!,,,Chandler,,,
 It's up to you.,,,Chandler,,,
 All right.,,,Chandler,,,
" You got it. (Starts looking at the pad, while Ross gets the turkey out of the fridge and starts to unwrap it) You got Nevada twice.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom),,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) My dad gave me his old one.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! What are you guys doing?,,,Chandler,,,
" I’m sorry, who?",,,Chandler,,,
 But we don’t know the neighbors.,,,Chandler,,,
 Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?,,,Chandler,,,
" Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, either that or uh…(Motions towards Joey’s door.)",,,Chandler,,,
 (about to cry) Am not!,,,Chandler,,,
" Don’t worry, I’m brave! I am brave! I…I am brave! (They get to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through the door.) Can you tell me who is there please?",,,Chandler,,,
 (laughs) 4:00 A.M.,,,Chandler,,,
" I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! (Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us.",,,Chandler,,,
 Mm! Night Gar’! (Monica closes the door.),,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?,,,Chandler,,,
 (with his mouth full) What happened? I’m just eating candy.,,,Chandler,,,
" Absolutely! Y’know, because tushie can mean both ass and good worker.",,,Chandler,,,
 What is the matter with you?,,,Chandler,,,
" Maybe, isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has s*x really loud?",,,Chandler,,,
 Y’know what would work?,,,Chandler,,,
 Stop making candy!,,,Chandler,,,
 You mean they like you.,,,Chandler,,,
 Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?,,,Chandler,,,
 (asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on?,,,Chandler,,,
 Joey!,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you doing?,,,Chandler,,,
" Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot Lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here! (Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?",,,Chandler,,,
 No not (imitating) Candy Lady.,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, y’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it!",,,Chandler,,,
 You’re welcome. (They kiss.),,,Chandler,,,
 No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh—are you okay?,,,Chandler,,,
 Buh-bye. (Hangs up the phone) I just got us reservations at Michelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.,,,Chandler,,,
 …betrothed couple.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Pheebs?,,,Chandler,,,
 Skull?,,,Chandler,,,
 How long have we been home?,,,Chandler,,,
 Lovely!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?",,,Chandler,,,
 Why not?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.",,,Chandler,,,
" No reason, except…she…told…me.",,,Chandler,,,
" No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.",,,Chandler,,,
" Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?",,,Chandler,,,
" (to the Maitre d') Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please? (Laughs.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.,,,Chandler,,,
 Is this because of the burrito thing?,,,Chandler,,,
 Give him money? It was a joke!,,,Chandler,,,
" Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d', very smoothly) Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it. (Shakes his hand)",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (Walks back to Monica),,,Chandler,,,
 Had the money in the wrong hand. (Shows her his left hand with the money in it),,,Chandler,,,
 How do you know so much about this?,,,Chandler,,,
" Richard used to do it, didn't he?",,,Chandler,,,
 Mustached b*st*rd…,,,Chandler,,,
 (walks up to the Maitre d') Excuse me...,,,Chandler,,,
" (finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' his money, but he isn't there anymore)",,,Chandler,,,
" Thank you Gunther, put it there. (He gets up, and shakes Gunther's hand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely not easier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks, Joey is just helping him to pick them up.) Thank you.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Pheebs!,,,Chandler,,,
" If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.),,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird…turtle-man?",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" You bet I did, Ben, put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand, but the money falls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing right there) Ho, ho, ho!",,,Chandler,,,
" You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!",,,Chandler,,,
 Why?,,,Chandler,,,
 But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.,,,Chandler,,,
" Fine, I'll give the suit back.",,,Chandler,,,
 Santa? Really?,,,Chandler,,,
 Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?,,,Chandler,,,
 Then it's okay! (They kiss.),,,Chandler,,,
" Because, if Santa and the Holiday…Armadillo? (Ross nods) ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?",,,Chandler,,,
 My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. (Glaring at Joey who’s nodding.),,,Chandler,,,
 Ohh. Mmm.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.",,,Chandler,,,
 (nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.,,,Chandler,,,
 I—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.,,,Chandler,,,
 Because it's too delicious.,,,Chandler,,,
" No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, (Reading the label) Momma’s Little Bakery. (Pause) I feel terrible, I’m a horrible, horrible, horrible person.",,,Chandler,,,
 So…,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, what’s at 8:00?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie’s made some new friends.",,,Chandler,,,
 I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then shushes him.),,,Chandler,,,
 Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!,,,Chandler,,,
 I can’t seem to say goodbye.,,,Chandler,,,
 Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!,,,Chandler,,,
 (closing the box) Y’know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.,,,Chandler,,,
 Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, thank you for lunch.",,,Chandler,,,
 So apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughs then Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?,,,Chandler,,,
 Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.),,,Chandler,,,
" By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, we don’t want that.",,,Chandler,,,
 But we should take it.,,,Chandler,,,
 Why?,,,Chandler,,,
 Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecake and they take off upstairs.),,,Chandler,,,
" I’m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I’ll regret it.",,,Chandler,,,
 What are you doing tonight?,,,Chandler,,,
 Dude! Dude! (Motions that Joey should pull up his pants.),,,Chandler,,,
" Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s what Monica said.,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!,,,Chandler,,,
 I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (She tries to whistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know what? I don’t trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I’m takin’ it back! (Grabs the cheesecake and heads for his apartment.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yes!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yes!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yes! Oh yes!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well that’s not fair, you’ve already had some!",,,Chandler,,,
 What do we use to split it?,,,Chandler,,,
" (examining the cake) Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh… There’s more crust on this side. Y’know? So, maybe if I measured…",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, I’ll pick that one. (Points.)",,,Chandler,,,
 (gloatingly and holding his piece) Ohhh!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don’t come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my… (Rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor. That process leaves just the forkful Chandler has, Rachel starts to go after that little bit and Chandler retreats into his apartment.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Stick to your side!,,,Chandler,,,
 (looking up with her) That’s a plane!,,,Chandler,,,
" (with a quivering voice) No, I’m not!",,,Chandler,,,
 Because it’s flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come on Monica! (He goes inside.),,,Chandler,,,
 (whispering) Monica!,,,Chandler,,,
" I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?",,,Chandler,,,
" Sorry, I just…can’t sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light and Monica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I’m like…(Fake snores.)",,,Chandler,,,
 What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and heads into the living room.),,,Chandler,,,
" Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) I’m sorry, I thought maybe I’d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.",,,Chandler,,,
 It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, y’know what we can do? Y’know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y’know like we did when we were first going out. It’d be fun!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?",,,Chandler,,,
" (Pause) No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s correct.,,,Chandler,,,
 (startled) What? What? What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah! You?,,,Chandler,,,
 (intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope you’re not thinking about cleaning the living room.,,,Chandler,,,
 Do you know what just happened?,,,Chandler,,,
 No. We were in the middle of s*x…and you fell asleep.,,,Chandler,,,
 (turning the light back on) Monica?,,,Chandler,,,
" I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Don’t fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesn’t move as he gets out of bed and as he’s heading for the door.) And I probably won’t spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hm-hmm, I told you! (Looks at the clock) I can’t believe that I’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes…",,,Chandler,,,
 Do you wanna?,,,Chandler,,,
" Couldn’t I just say, ""This is Ross?""",,,Chandler,,,
 (knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.),,,Chandler,,,
" Joey! Joe! (Sees that he’s not here and starts investigating. He picks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) Beer’s still cold. Something terrible must’ve happened here! (He decides it’s not that important; sits down on Rosita, and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! (Runs over to Stevie.) Stevie, I was never here! (Runs out.)",,,Chandler,,,
" My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! (He runs out the door, grabs the back of Rosita, and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are coming up the stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore.",,,Chandler,,,
 (excitedly) Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?,,,Chandler,,,
 That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair?,,,Chandler,,,
 I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replaced it with mine!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?",,,Chandler,,,
 I’m gettin’ my chair back! (Heads for Joey and Rachel’s.),,,Chandler,,,
 Joey you broke my chair!!,,,Chandler,,,
 I think I should get the chair!,,,Chandler,,,
" Because you (Points to Joey) broke a chair and you (Points to Rachel) broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair, is me!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, where’s the logic in that?!",,,Chandler,,,
 So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) She’s not as pretty as she was when she was 29.,,,Chandler,,,
" No Rach, it’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn’t that much fun.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ross, a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Joey) Would you put that back on?! Monica’s gonna be here any minute!,,,Chandler,,,
" (frustrated) Okay, for the last time. It’s not named for each individual man.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can’t believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I can’t believe that you would have a tux that’s thirty years old! (Puts his hand on Mr. Geller’s shoulder.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.),,,Chandler,,,
" Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off the lights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the assemblage.)",,,Chandler,,,
" (getting up to investigate) Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what’s going on.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey-hey are you drunk?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, here’s the thing. We’re gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you’re drunk.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I’ll take care of it.",,,Chandler,,,
 (laughing) Okay we have to do something about your breath.,,,Chandler,,,
" That’s still yours. Okay, now remember it’s a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.",,,Chandler,,,
" See? (Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room, and has to pass in front of Mr. Geller who’s sitting at the table and Mrs. Geller who’s standing next to him.)",,,Chandler,,,
 (correcting her) Phil.,,,Chandler,,,
" Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on the steps.) Okay, (catches her) you’re doing great. You’re doing great. You’re doing fine.",,,Chandler,,,
 Monica’s a little drunk.,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesn’t want her parents to know she’s drunk.,,,Chandler,,,
 Monica’s wasted.,,,Chandler,,,
" (To Rachel) Okay, will you just go help her change please!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!",,,Chandler,,,
" For my last birthday you gave me a hug! (To Rachel) Okay, read the card! Read the card!",,,Chandler,,,
 No-no-no-no! That was the joke!,,,Chandler,,,
" No, because you’re not a grandmother!",,,Chandler,,,
 (to a waiter) Oh that’s great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? (The waiter comes over) There we go.,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) How are you feeling?,,,Chandler,,,
" (To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don’t talk to anyone.",,,Chandler,,,
 Pheebs!!,,,Chandler,,,
 I think it’s necessary. (Backs away anyhow.),,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, here we go.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! How’d it go?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Ross) Monica said wedding.,,,Chandler,,,
 Do you think you could get through a poem?,,,Chandler,,,
 Too?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-type manner.)",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s great!,,,Chandler,,,
 So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!,,,Chandler,,,
 Don’t do it.,,,Chandler,,,
 I think it’s the dying cat parade.,,,Chandler,,,
 (turning around and looking) Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, ""You’re half Scottish right?""",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Why is your family Ross?!,,,Chandler,,,
" If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I feel like a snack!",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh no thanks. I don’t like anything from my Scottish heritage.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)",,,Chandler,,,
 We heard you play all the way from your apartment!,,,Chandler,,,
" That’s not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.",,,Chandler,,,
 Because we hate them.,,,Chandler,,,
 We have heard you play.,,,Chandler,,,
 You mean the spitter?,,,Chandler,,,
 Easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil.,,,Chandler,,,
 You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?,,,Chandler,,,
" Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say ""I do,"" he’s thinking, ""Yeah, I’d do her too!""",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah!,,,Chandler,,,
 Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.,,,Chandler,,,
" We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!",,,Chandler,,,
" No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.",,,Chandler,,,
 Joe…,,,Chandler,,,
" (To Monica) Y’know, we haven’t found anybody else.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah you can do it.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Our minister…,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) Should we call the spitter?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. O-okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" See Joe, not that that’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!",,,Chandler,,,
" No, not us… (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)",,,Chandler,,,
" See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic stories. Nice stories.",,,Chandler,,,
 Joe?,,,Chandler,,,
 Isn’t that what happened with you and the bridesmaid?,,,Chandler,,,
 And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.,,,Chandler,,,
 But then later that night…,,,Chandler,,,
 (answering the door) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Well I was… I wasn't exactly expecting company after…(He looks at his watch.) 9:15.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you’re not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, look it’s been a really emotional time y’know, and you’ve had a lot to drink. And you’ve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!",,,Chandler,,,
 You kidding? You’re the most beautiful woman in most rooms… (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?,,,Chandler,,,
 But we don’t do that.,,,Chandler,,,
 How drunk are you?,,,Chandler,,,
 (thinks) That’s the perfect amount!,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 I know.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay!,,,Chandler,,,
 It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yep!,,,Chandler,,,
 Count of three?,,,Chandler,,,
 Two!,,,Chandler,,,
 Well I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.,,,Chandler,,,
 Eh!,,,Chandler,,,
 Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers as Joey enters. Remember?),,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e… (Notices that the TV is turned off.),,,Chandler,,,
 No! No! No!,,,Chandler,,,
 They’re in my bag over there. (Points.),,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, could you leave me one?",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 No I-I-I’m fine.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Who did you originally want to hook up with?,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, it’s not important? It’s not important?! If it wasn’t for a bridesmaid you’d be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!",,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I’m runner up.,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Joey) Look there is no way you’re doing this wedding now. Okay?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I don’t know what I need. I need a walk.",,,Chandler,,,
" It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin. (Walks out and slams the door.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his plate) It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!,,,Chandler,,,
" Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding…",,,Chandler,,,
 How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!,,,Chandler,,,
 That’s what you should say.,,,Chandler,,,
 When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say.,,,Chandler,,,
 I’d love it if you would do it.,,,Chandler,,,
 But those are the words! Those exact words!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.",,,Chandler,,,
 So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we’re trying to get to play at the wedding?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!,,,Chandler,,,
 Gap commercial. (To Monica) So did you book them? Did you call?,,,Chandler,,,
 Do you want me to call?,,,Chandler,,,
 Staying out of the way.,,,Chandler,,,
 Sure! That’s one of the great things about being engaged. I’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Ross) Smooth.,,,Chandler,,,
" So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?",,,Chandler,,,
 Huh.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Uh Joe, when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you don’t come by? That’s okay!",,,Chandler,,,
 Really? Right across the street?,,,Chandler,,,
 When’d you meet her?,,,Chandler,,,
 Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hi! How’d it go?,,,Chandler,,,
 (sarcastically shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross’s situation?,,,Chandler,,,
" So this is nice! I wish I didn’t have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh, by the way, what’s the name of the girl you’re dating?",,,Chandler,,,
 Bye! (Exits.),,,Chandler,,,
 Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (He goes into the bathroom to wash his hands.),,,Chandler,,,
 (returning) What are you guys talking about?,,,Chandler,,,
 But I love swing music!,,,Chandler,,,
" Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there’s another reason too.",,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t want to say.,,,Chandler,,,
 Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hi, honey! I’m home!",,,Chandler,,,
 Why? Do you have another boyfriend in there or something?,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know it’s funny I started it but, now it’s scaring me. So could you come out here please?",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh you got a wedding dress? That’s great!,,,Chandler,,,
 Well then why can’t I see it?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay I promise. I’ll-I’ll hate it. (She enters.) Wow! You-you look…hideous.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen. Wh-why do you have to return it?",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh that’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it’s like yuck! It’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay!,,,Chandler,,,
 (without turning around) I thought you were gonna be gone all day.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh totally! (Holds up his finger.) Pull my finger.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big",,,Chandler,,,
 Kinda. They’re really big.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" No. No, see when I first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.",,,Chandler,,,
" Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I’m afraid even more sweating.",,,Chandler,,,
" I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. (Monica laughs.) Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts, I’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.",,,Chandler,,,
 (hoarsely) Water! Water! Water!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.,,,Chandler,,,
 Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…,,,Chandler,,,
" Technically we could have s*x again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s me! Come on!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.",,,Chandler,,,
 (transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!,,,Chandler,,,
 I’ll be right with you.,,,Chandler,,,
 I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at Monica’s eyes.) Say something.,,,Chandler,,,
" Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?",,,Chandler,,,
" This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.",,,Chandler,,,
 Y’know I think we should invite them.,,,Chandler,,,
 Well this is just sad!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.",,,Chandler,,,
" (sees another rack) Well, what’s the deal with these? These-these look nice.",,,Chandler,,,
 You mean like for award shows?,,,Chandler,,,
" You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, ""Who are you wearing?! You look fabulous!""",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Not bad.,,,Chandler,,,
 Who’s that?,,,Chandler,,,
 Pierce Brosnan?,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you serious?,,,Chandler,,,
 007?! This is James Bond’s tux?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I have to get married in James Bond’s tux!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, it’s not just that, I would be England’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?",,,Chandler,,,
 A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux!,,,Chandler,,,
 So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.,,,Chandler,,,
" Please, don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.",,,Chandler,,,
 That was pretty 007.,,,Chandler,,,
 Ross is Batman!,,,Chandler,,,
 Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!,,,Chandler,,,
 Batman has a utility belt!,,,Chandler,,,
 Batman has the Batmobile!,,,Chandler,,,
 Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get ESPN right?,,,Chandler,,,
" Actually, I don’t like martinis.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I would but mine doesn’t fit. The pants are a little tight.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, does that mean that you’re not going to be wearing yours?",,,Chandler,,,
 (standing up) Let me try it on!,,,Chandler,,,
 (trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds something in the pocket) What’s this?,,,Chandler,,,
 An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!,,,Chandler,,,
 The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. (Hands him the jacket and walks away.),,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you’re welcome. And tell them we’re really glad they’re coming.",,,Chandler,,,
 (yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!,,,Chandler,,,
 Whose is it?,,,Chandler,,,
 Whose is it?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, come on! I don’t care! Come on! Whose is it?",,,Chandler,,,
 Do you realize you get louder each week?,,,Chandler,,,
" I figured I’d buy those. Pat, I’d like to buy a vow. (Laughs)",,,Chandler,,,
" Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?",,,Chandler,,,
 Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?,,,Chandler,,,
" (watching in her) (in his head) Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What’s wrong with me? Ooh, don’t open that door.",,,Chandler,,,
" (writing) Monica, there are no words… (To Joey and Ross) There are no words! This should not be this hard!",,,Chandler,,,
" I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that.",,,Chandler,,,
 (seeing her) Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?",,,Chandler,,,
 (shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) That’s one?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.",,,Chandler,,,
 (writing) Monica…,,,Chandler,,,
 (writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
 You'll get one.,,,Chandler,,,
" All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, no.",,,Chandler,,,
" (trapped) Uh, uh.",,,Chandler,,,
 Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in),,,Chandler,,,
 Nice try.,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, Monica…",,,Chandler,,,
 This is not going to work.,,,Chandler,,,
 You are so great! I love you!,,,Chandler,,,
" Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!",,,Chandler,,,
 No I didn't!,,,Chandler,,,
 No I didn't!,,,Chandler,,,
 No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!,,,Chandler,,,
"  Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, what if all my stuff was here?",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God, I thought… (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?",,,Chandler,,,
" I've had a very long, hard day.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.",,,Chandler,,,
" Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Joe!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some coleslaw, some beans, and a Coke—(Yelps in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)—Diet Coke.",,,Chandler,,,
 It happened in London.,,,Chandler,,,
 The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.,,,Chandler,,,
 No-no-no-no-no! You can't!,,,Chandler,,,
" (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)",,,Chandler,,,
" (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?",,,Chandler,,,
 Phoebe knows about us!,,,Chandler,,,
" Ahh yes, the messers become the messees!",,,Chandler,,,
" Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, you're-you're going?",,,Chandler,,,
" (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy we're gonna have all the s*x.",,,Chandler,,,
 Not if I kiss you first.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have s*x with ya!,,,Chandler,,,
 Because I'm in love with Monica!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.",,,Chandler,,,
 Who are those people?,,,Chandler,,,
 What’s going on?,,,Chandler,,,
 So we both finished our vows.,,,Chandler,,,
" Don’t worry honey, we’ll make yours funnier.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, what do you guys think?",,,Chandler,,,
 You really like it?,,,Chandler,,,
 I stole Monica’s and changed the name.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.",,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not that close. I haven’t seen him in years.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.",,,Chandler,,,
" Trust me, you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.",,,Chandler,,,
 What’s this?,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—Think of the money we’ll save!! (Monica just looks at him.) We’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?,,,Chandler,,,
 Y’know we already went over this and I won!,,,Chandler,,,
 Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. I don’t wanna.,,,Chandler,,,
" No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedos—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. He was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!",,,Chandler,,,
 He had s*x with Mr. Garibaldi!,,,Chandler,,,
 Does it matter?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah o-okay, but I’m just doing this for you.",,,Chandler,,,
 So I really never get to win anymore?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)",,,Chandler,,,
" No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re here yet! I’m not sure I’m ready for that. And besides, he’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.",,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t know if I’ve told you this, but he’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, he’s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y’know it’s all very Cats in the Cradle—I don’t want to get into it. (The show starts.) Here we go.",,,Chandler,,,
 And there’s daddy!,,,Chandler,,,
" Believe me, I’ve been saying that for years. Oh my God!",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s Mr. Garibaldi playing the piano.,,,Chandler,,,
 He’s coming into the audience. He’s coming into the audience.,,,Chandler,,,
 It can’t happen like this. Okay? I’ll meet you back at the hotel.,,,Chandler,,,
 (resigning himself to his fate) Chandler. (He quickly sits down.),,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, they’re a hoot.",,,Chandler,,,
 Actually Monica and I are engaged.,,,Chandler,,,
 Wait! Wait! We’d really love it if you could be there.,,,Chandler,,,
" I know it would make me happy, ma’am.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) When I was growing up I…played the one on the far left.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the mrs. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.,,,Chandler,,,
 The young hot ball and chain.,,,Chandler,,,
 What’s up?,,,Chandler,,,
" Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I’m buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.",,,Chandler,,,
 But you’re still my friend?,,,Chandler,,,
" During this time…are you, are you still my best man?",,,Chandler,,,
 Do I still call you Ross?,,,Chandler,,,
" (smiling) Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.",,,Chandler,,,
 So are we…friends again?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (Pause) You won’t believe what Monica’s older brother just said to me!,,,Chandler,,,
 (entering from the bedroom) Okay. Here’s a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, include more people in this.",,,Chandler,,,
 Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.,,,Chandler,,,
 Well you don’t have to sound so surprised.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Honestly? Me too.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. Y’know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I’ll go all…Chandler. But nothing has.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. I’ll be right there.,,,Chandler,,,
 We’re the Bings.,,,Chandler,,,
 Mr. and Mrs. Bing! (Walks away.),,,Chandler,,,
 Hi.,,,Chandler,,,
 Mom. Thanks for wearing something. (They hug.) (She’s wearing a tight dress with a lot of cleavage showing.),,,Chandler,,,
 Hi…dad.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God! (He and Monica walk away.),,,Chandler,,,
 How did you guys find me? I knew I should’ve hid at the gym!,,,Chandler,,,
 Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I’m related to Monica. How is she?,,,Chandler,,,
 No! No! No! I can’t do that!,,,Chandler,,,
" Because if I go home, we’re gonna become the Bings! I can’t be the Bings!",,,Chandler,,,
 The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!,,,Chandler,,,
 No.,,,Chandler,,,
" It’s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don’t race cars! I don’t make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.",,,Chandler,,,
" I want to. I love her so much, but I’m afr…It’s too huge.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well yeah, but then…",,,Chandler,,,
 Depends on what you mean by we.,,,Chandler,,,
 No.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah okay. Well, what’s the next little bit?",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. You’re right. Hey I-I can do that.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, excuse me for a minute. (Starts to leave)",,,Chandler,,,
" Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh fresh air!,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Ross! (He starts to get up.),,,Chandler,,,
 (standing up) That’s right! I’m not!,,,Chandler,,,
 I know about Monica.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.",,,Chandler,,,
 You don’t know?,,,Chandler,,,
 Monica’s pregnant.,,,Chandler,,,
 Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes…,,,Chandler,,,
" Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that’s when I uh, saw this. (He holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads I (heart) New York.) Yeah, y’know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can’t be scary.",,,Chandler,,,
" But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she’d know I was okay.",,,Chandler,,,
 You look beautiful mom. (His dad clears his throat.) You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) I’m so glad you're here. (He kisses his mom.),,,Chandler,,,
 Are you Joey?,,,Chandler,,,
 You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.),,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 (in Monica’s ear) He’s Greek Orthodox.,,,Chandler,,,
" (To Ross) No, that’s okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way, it’s okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I’m sure? (He leans in and kisses her.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I do.,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.,,,Chandler,,,
 Our baby.,,,Chandler,,,
 Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.,,,Chandler,,,
 Then…who did?,,,Chandler,,,
 What?! What are you talking about?,,,Chandler,,,
 Who’s the father?,,,Chandler,,,
 Why not?,,,Chandler,,,
 As in Barbara Streisand’s husband James Brolin?,,,Chandler,,,
 Y’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.,,,Chandler,,,
 Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya.,,,Chandler,,,
 No?,,,Chandler,,,
 I’ve been taking dancing lessons.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.",,,Chandler,,,
 So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?,,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t know, it’s these new shoes, they’re all slippery.",,,Chandler,,,
 Not well.,,,Chandler,,,
 Thank you.,,,Chandler,,,
 Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.,,,Chandler,,,
 Funny: ha-ha or funny: (Mimes blowing his brain out.),,,Chandler,,,
 What size shoes do you wear?,,,Chandler,,,
" Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?",,,Chandler,,,
 (looking at Joey’s feet) Those aren’t eleven and a half.,,,Chandler,,,
 And the world will never know.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.",,,Chandler,,,
 But you’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.,,,Chandler,,,
 Did it turn into sand?,,,Chandler,,,
" (sliding up behind her) No. No, I won’t. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn’t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why?,,,Chandler,,,
 (to the front desk clerk) Hi! We’re checking out of the bridal suite.,,,Chandler,,,
" And I’m the happiest guy in the world! (Monica goes and sits down in a huff.) Oh honey, come on don’t be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!",,,Chandler,,,
 We got the honeymoon.,,,Chandler,,,
 The wedding pictures?,,,Chandler,,,
 Not the disposable cameras from the tables.,,,Chandler,,,
" I’ll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.",,,Chandler,,,
 What? What did you take a picture of?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, well I’m gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. (Joey laughs again.) 32 Joe. You’re 32! (Exits)",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah but you don’t need—(Picks up something)—What is this?,,,Chandler,,,
 Score! Where are the disposable cameras?,,,Chandler,,,
 The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said…",,,Chandler,,,
 So you don’t have the cameras?!,,,Chandler,,,
 So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!,,,Chandler,,,
 Great.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! Did you find the cameras?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well this is great. Y’know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she’s really depressed.",,,Chandler,,,
 All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’t believe I screwed this up!,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you serious?,,,Chandler,,,
 Marriage advice? Really?!,,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t know, Monica picked out the flowers.",,,Chandler,,,
 She picked those out too.,,,Chandler,,,
 That was her.,,,Chandler,,,
 I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?,,,Chandler,,,
" (to another couple) Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?",,,Chandler,,,
 Uhh… Yeah sure. (Holds the camera up to his face.) Click!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah. I’ll take, I’ll take your picture. (He takes the picture with his finger over the lens.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!,,,Chandler,,,
 Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, you ready for the last picture?",,,Chandler,,,
" Get ready to run. (Chandler walks over to the new bride.) Congratulations on your wedding. (He grabs her, kisses her, Ross takes the picture, and they both run out.)",,,Chandler,,,
 We’re back!,,,Chandler,,,
 It’s picture time.,,,Chandler,,,
" (showing her the pictures) Here’s a picture of Ross. (Shows another one.) And that’s me. (Another one.) And that’s me and Ross. (Another one.) Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.",,,Chandler,,,
 Eh?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, so this isn’t a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with…with this lady. Which by the look on your face I’m sure you’ll remember. So we don’t need—(Rips the picture)—There’s no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!,,,Chandler,,,
 Call it even?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! Babe! Aren’t you excited we’re going on our honeymoon?,,,Chandler,,,
" (singing) Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama…",,,Chandler,,,
 I’d better go pack.,,,Chandler,,,
" A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit. (Goes into the bedroom.)",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Hey, what was that all about?",,,Chandler,,,
 (in a high pitched voice) What?! I didn’t even know that—Why didn’t you tell me?! (Pause) Why am I talking like this?!,,,Chandler,,,
 (in the high pitched voice) What?! (Normal voice) I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.",,,Chandler,,,
 You already know.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh honey, leave them alone, they’re in love.",,,Chandler,,,
 We are on our honeymoon.,,,Chandler,,,
" 25J and K, any chance those aren’t together?",,,Chandler,,,
 No.,,,Chandler,,,
 Just act like you belong.,,,Chandler,,,
 Shh! (To the guy behind the counter) Nice to see you again. (They tries to walk past him.),,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, of course. (Shows him the tickets.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh that’s all right, I have it memorized. It’s 1A.",,,Chandler,,,
 Apology accepted. Excuse us. (They try to enter again.),,,Chandler,,,
 Oh you’ve got to be kidding me.,,,Chandler,,,
 We’re you just ten seconds later!,,,Chandler,,,
 (looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff.,,,Chandler,,,
 What else is new?,,,Chandler,,,
" Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can’t wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.",,,Chandler,,,
" They’re terrific, and they live right here in the city.",,,Chandler,,,
" I’m sorry, we’re just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.",,,Chandler,,,
" Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance…",,,Chandler,,,
 We really…didn’t get a chance to…,,,Chandler,,,
 Ross! It’s got your wavy black lines!,,,Chandler,,,
 Y’know who has a great video camera?,,,Chandler,,,
 Let’s call ‘em.,,,Chandler,,,
 Here you go. (Shows her the number again.),,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, we’re gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them agree.)",,,Chandler,,,
" I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong.",,,Chandler,,,
 I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!,,,Chandler,,,
 Well maybe it was all of your questions.,,,Chandler,,,
" The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!",,,Chandler,,,
 (angrily) Was that another question?,,,Chandler,,,
 Did you do it on our invitations?!,,,Chandler,,,
" So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framed invitation down onto the table.)",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s the magic story you use when you wanna have s*x!,,,Chandler,,,
 Jenny! That is so Jenny!,,,Chandler,,,
" You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet p0rn?",,,Chandler,,,
 What’s funny about that?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey that’s okay. So, where do you want to go?",,,Chandler,,,
 The Hard Rock Café?,,,Chandler,,,
 Again?!,,,Chandler,,,
 You like the Purple Rain display! (A guy walks up.) Hey Bob.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, he thinks that’s my name.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t say anything. And then the next time he said, ""Hey Toby, do you want a donut?"" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and I’m still Toby.",,,Chandler,,,
" No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides, we work in different departments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What’s the big deal? It could be worse, it’s not like he’s calling me Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Shh! It is a family name!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Bob.,,,Chandler,,,
" If I see him, I’ll ask.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah!,,,Chandler,,,
 We’re on a semi-first name basis.,,,Chandler,,,
" Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know if he has what it takes.",,,Chandler,,,
 But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.,,,Chandler,,,
 I think it’s best sir.,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em.",,,Chandler,,,
 What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Sure, what’s up?",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Bobby.,,,Chandler,,,
" Uhh yeah. Yeah, it’s (Points down the hall) right, right down there. (When he has Bob looking down the hall, he turns around and knocks his nameplate off of his door.) Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here.",,,Chandler,,,
 Bob!,,,Chandler,,,
 Well that puts me in a difficult position.,,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Bob. Bob! Bob!!! (He turns around) What the hell are you doing?!,,,Chandler,,,
 You’re an actor!,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering from the bedroom wearing a big, pink bunny costume) Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume…",,,Chandler,,,
 The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!,,,Chandler,,,
 No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!,,,Chandler,,,
 How is that me?,,,Chandler,,,
 When have I ever done that?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Wow! I don’t have the worst costume anymore!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh! Hi!,,,Chandler,,,
 Joey’s gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you’d come by as a slutty nurse.,,,Chandler,,,
" You’d think that would embarrass me, but you see I’m maxed out.",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Ross) Marry her.,,,Chandler,,,
 Howdy doody.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh relax man, relax. You’re looking a little flushed.",,,Chandler,,,
 What question?,,,Chandler,,,
 There’s no question.,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) You picked Ross?!,,,Chandler,,,
 I cannot believe you didn’t pick me.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove it? (He pushes Ross who starts to fall backwards until Mona catches him.),,,Chandler,,,
 (To Ross) You’re going down.,,,Chandler,,,
 That means nothing to me. (To Ross) Come on!,,,Chandler,,,
 And dignity.,,,Chandler,,,
 Nope! I can do this all day.,,,Chandler,,,
" God, I’m exhausted.",,,Chandler,,,
 No way! If anything you’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinks I’m a wimp!,,,Chandler,,,
 You’re Spudnik.,,,Chandler,,,
 Fine. (He lets Ross win.) Oh no!,,,Chandler,,,
" Listen, I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, I let him win—Ross!",,,Chandler,,,
 Would you tell her I let you win please?,,,Chandler,,,
 I am strong! I’ll show you! (He sits down at the table.),,,Chandler,,,
 Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay. 1…2…3—Go! (Once again he’s at a stalemate, but this time he’s in pain.) (Pause) I’m gonna kill myself!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know uh, I didn’t actually do this.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, it wasn’t you.",,,Chandler,,,
 I got a maid. Yay!,,,Chandler,,,
" Uh honey, I know you don’t like to relinquish control…",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, she’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, I distinctly remember ‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?",,,Chandler,,,
 What’s the matter?,,,Chandler,,,
 See? I told you.,,,Chandler,,,
 (pause) What?,,,Chandler,,,
 So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?,,,Chandler,,,
 She must’ve been planning this for years!,,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?",,,Chandler,,,
" So, shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?",,,Chandler,,,
" Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?",,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hi!,,,Chandler,,,
 How come?,,,Chandler,,,
 To see her pants?,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you sure? Did you see the stain?,,,Chandler,,,
" God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh dear God!,,,Chandler,,,
 And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.,,,Chandler,,,
 Here’s another plan…No!,,,Chandler,,,
 Why?,,,Chandler,,,
 I fear a jury will see it the same way!,,,Chandler,,,
 You see that?,,,Chandler,,,
 All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!,,,Chandler,,,
 You need new clothes.,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m leaning. This is where I lean.,,,Chandler,,,
 Brenda a bee!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!,,,Chandler,,,
 You do?,,,Chandler,,,
 I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I just see your bra?,,,Chandler,,,
 Her what?!!,,,Chandler,,,
 You had a bachelorette party?!,,,Chandler,,,
" I thought we weren’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.",,,Chandler,,,
 You went home with the waitress.,,,Chandler,,,
 I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!,,,Chandler,,,
 My God! You must be good in bed!,,,Chandler,,,
 She’s okay with Rachel and the baby?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you’re going down the same path, but you’re really going down different ones.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Honey! That’s crazy! I don’t want you to get me a stripper…,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it’s a little creepy. Y’know? I’m not a bachelor anymore.",,,Chandler,,,
 All right fine! But I’m only doing this for you!,,,Chandler,,,
 And Joey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.",,,Chandler,,,
 I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you doing?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. I can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day.,,,Chandler,,,
" You’re right, this is more fun.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi. (Joey blows on a noisemaker.),,,Chandler,,,
 That’s me.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, yeah right over there.",,,Chandler,,,
 That was weird.,,,Chandler,,,
 So she’s a…,,,Chandler,,,
 I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!,,,Chandler,,,
" Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. (Walks towards the bedroom.) Ma’am, are you also a stripper?",,,Chandler,,,
" That is funny, maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh actually, I’d rather you…Yeah, go ahead. We’re gonna have to burn that room down anyway.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why would she do that?,,,Chandler,,,
 This is the worst bachelor party ever!,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Joey) In a minute? What’s gonna happen in a minute?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Why me?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Which is why you should do it.,,,Chandler,,,
 You do it!,,,Chandler,,,
" All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! (Joey smirks.) What?",,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t think we’ve actually done this before!,,,Chandler,,,
 Well we…we still hang out.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well y’know, things are different. I’m…I’m married now.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we’ll make time to hang out with each other.",,,Chandler,,,
" Her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?",,,Chandler,,,
 Monica! Wait!,,,Chandler,,,
 (puts on his crown) Carry on.,,,Chandler,,,
 Could you not narrate?,,,Chandler,,,
 I have no idea.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah! I’m just pretending to watch the game so I don’t have to help out with stuff.,,,Chandler,,,
 Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah! Anderson just scored again! (To Phoebe) There’s no Anderson.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh hey. I’d shake your hand but uh; I’m really into the game. Plus, I think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next to each other.",,,Chandler,,,
" I’m watching the game, but I’m not deaf!",,,Chandler,,,
" (To Phoebe) Y’know, it’s been a while since we’ve screamed something. Maybe we should.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh come on!,,,Chandler,,,
 Good game!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.,,,Chandler,,,
 (simultaneously) Detroit.,,,Chandler,,,
 Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?,,,Chandler,,,
 Did she look 16?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.",,,Chandler,,,
 New haircut? (Monica nods ‘No.’) Necklace? (No) Dress? (No) Boots? (Monica nods ‘Yes.’) Boots!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m gonna miss being able to afford food.,,,Chandler,,,
 She had a point. (Shows her the receipt.),,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah well, too bad we’re gonna have to return them.",,,Chandler,,,
 I have you.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey-hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.),,,Chandler,,,
 (returning to his seat) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 (spinning around looking for him) I don’t think you did a very thorough job!,,,Chandler,,,
 (opening the door) What’s wrong?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh don’t forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (They go into the apartment.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Now sweetie, I know you don’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why not?,,,Chandler,,,
 Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?,,,Chandler,,,
" You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know, that party wasn’t bad.",,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?",,,Chandler,,,
" What honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’s go.",,,Chandler,,,
 What’s going on?,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. (Pause) It’s oddly unsettling.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hop on.,,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, I know you’re in pain right now, but I’m a little turned on.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh I’m sorry! Do you need a break?,,,Chandler,,,
 I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.,,,Chandler,,,
 (pause) I don’t have your boots.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!",,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?",,,Chandler,,,
 Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (Moves closer to the window.),,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?",,,Chandler,,,
" I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry.",,,Chandler,,,
 No.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn’t it?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.,,,Chandler,,,
 It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.,,,Chandler,,,
 Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.,,,Chandler,,,
 Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.,,,Chandler,,,
 Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with that bitch.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl.",,,Chandler,,,
 It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh no-no-no!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hi honey I’m home.,,,Chandler,,,
" It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!",,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ooh, I don’t know if we’re there yet.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?,,,Chandler,,,
 Pheebs you didn’t have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang…,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, okay.",,,Chandler,,,
 I kinda like it here.,,,Chandler,,,
 Well what did it do?,,,Chandler,,,
 A vending machine?,,,Chandler,,,
 Who cares? It’s a stupid game.,,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t suck. It’s sucks. You suck.,,,Chandler,,,
 Why do you want to play this game so bad?,,,Chandler,,,
 You are not going to believe what I did today!,,,Chandler,,,
 I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. (Pause) Although I-I hope they don’t.,,,Chandler,,,
" Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five! (Holds up his hand to give Monica a high five, only he can’t straighten his fingers.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours, it’ll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they’re dirty words.",,,Chandler,,,
 Because it’s awesome.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.",,,Chandler,,,
 It is when you put it together with that one.,,,Chandler,,,
" Come on, he won’t even know what they mean.",,,Chandler,,,
 Have you talked to him lately?,,,Chandler,,,
" No-no-no, if you unplug it, I’ll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. (She unplugs it.) No! (And plugs it back in.) Hey look at that! Look at that, it’s still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM (Read Only Memory, it’s a memory chip.) Chip in it or something!",,,Chandler,,,
 With the claw?!,,,Chandler,,,
 (smiles) Pull my finger—(Looks at his hand)—My hand is messed up.,,,Chandler,,,
 I did. (Looks at his still deformed hand) But it came at a price.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (They both look at him.) Was it just me?!",,,Chandler,,,
 One more score to go! You can do it! (Touches her shoulder.),,,Chandler,,,
 All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Are you, are you high?",,,Chandler,,,
 Really? I don’t like baths.,,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, it’s not the bath I enjoy, it’s the wet, naked lady.",,,Chandler,,,
 Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.,,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, it’s 2:00 on a Wednesday and I’m watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh my God, what’s up?!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no-no, no you don’t, just come back.",,,Chandler,,,
 Do you?,,,Chandler,,,
 In London?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.",,,Chandler,,,
 If that.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 s*x on the balcony?,,,Chandler,,,
 What is it?,,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having s*x on the balcony?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, this does butch it up a bit.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss s*x on the balcony?",,,Chandler,,,
" (thinking) All right, this isn’t so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I’ve got my boat.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God.,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m going to need a bigger boat.,,,Chandler,,,
" I’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there’s something wrong.",,,Chandler,,,
 I’m in the bathtub.,,,Chandler,,,
" I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’t compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!",,,Chandler,,,
 The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different. (Pause) It’s interesting.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!",,,Chandler,,,
 I had the exact same conversation.,,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?",,,Chandler,,,
 Uh-huh.,,,Chandler,,,
 He didn’t say anything about that to me.,,,Chandler,,,
" He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.",,,Chandler,,,
 But what did he mean by rules?,,,Chandler,,,
 Because he was looking at her differently.,,,Chandler,,,
 My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!,,,Chandler,,,
 You don’t say anything.,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m not going to let you say anything.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, God!",,,Chandler,,,
 Do I smell essential oils?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 L-leaving my troubles behind?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed.",,,Chandler,,,
 (upset) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) You told her?!,,,Chandler,,,
 (sarcastically) Because it’s a relaxing and enjoyable time!,,,Chandler,,,
 You like Rachel?!,,,Chandler,,,
 (sarcastically) Yes we’re all in here and we would love for you to join us!,,,Chandler,,,
 I’ll…I’ll get you later!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. And what you’re doing feels so good.,,,Chandler,,,
 You’re not?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey Pheebs, whatâ€™s up?",,,Chandler,,,
" Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaningâ€¦Donâ€™t let Phoebe in.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, Phoebe I thought Iâ€™dâ€”(Off Phoebeâ€™s look)â€”Yeah, what the hell. (Exits with Phoebe.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey babe.,,,Chandler,,,
 Who says you canâ€™t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?,,,Chandler,,,
 How about to the street say from the balcony?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. How about in that cabinet?,,,Chandler,,,
 How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by the bathroom.),,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (Tries the door.) Itâ€™s locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yâ€™know, Iâ€™ve been living here a while and Iâ€™ve never seen whatâ€™s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?",,,Chandler,,,
 Donâ€™t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!,,,Chandler,,,
 Fine.,,,Chandler,,,
 (walking casually away) Love you.,,,Chandler,,,
" Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said, ""If it helps!"" (Goes to the bedroom.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I wasnâ€™t trying to open your closet! I wasnâ€™t trying to open your closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.),,,Chandler,,,
 Monica has a secret closet and she wonâ€™t let me see whatâ€™s in it.,,,Chandler,,,
 I donâ€™t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I canâ€™t see?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?,,,Chandler,,,
 And here we goâ€¦,,,Chandler,,,
 There has got to be a way!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait, Iâ€™m not an nine-year-old girl.",,,Chandler,,,
 Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.,,,Chandler,,,
" So, howâ€™s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?",,,Chandler,,,
 Thatâ€™s a good idea.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, itâ€™s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Yâ€™know? Youâ€™re doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (He loses his card behind the door.) Richard? If-if youâ€™re in there, could you pass me my credit card?",,,Chandler,,,
" Not to shabby, I got this all off myselfâ€¦using my wifeâ€™s tools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see whatâ€™s behind the green door! It is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) Oh my God!",,,Chandler,,,
 (laughs) Youâ€™re messy.,,,Chandler,,,
 I married Fred Sanford!,,,Chandler,,,
" No, honey youâ€™re not sick! Look, I donâ€™t love you because youâ€™re organized, I love you in spite of that.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 So Rachelâ€™s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you okay?,,,Chandler,,,
 Happy Valentine’s!,,,Chandler,,,
" (picking up a video from the table) ‘Candy and Cookie’. ‘Candy and Cookie?’ Monica got me p0rn?! Girl-on-girl p0rn?! She really must love me!! (Chandler runs over to the TV, puts the tape in, and sits down to enjoy some ""p0rn"")",,,Chandler,,,
" I love you, St. Valentine.",,,Chandler,,,
" Woah, woah, that’s not pretty!",,,Chandler,,,
" Worst p0rn ever! Worst p0rn ever! (Chandler starts to press buttons on the remote control, frantically.)",,,Chandler,,,
 I am trying!,,,Chandler,,,
 (pointing at the video) Why did you get me this?,,,Chandler,,,
" It’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. Oh, the dilating…",,,Chandler,,,
 I thought…maybe…you got me p0rn for Valentine’s Day.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I’m not really in a sexy mood right now.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?",,,Chandler,,,
 How long it took to go back in the water?,,,Chandler,,,
 You don’t know. You didn’t see it.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? (picks up the remote and presses a button, and he immediately makes a face that just looks like he’s going to throw up!)",,,Chandler,,,
" See, honey, there’s—(puts his hand on her leg)",,,Chandler,,,
 90 seconds.,,,Chandler,,,
" You know, it haunts me? Up ‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!",,,Chandler,,,
 I can do that.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I know!",,,Chandler,,,
 Poor Ross.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don’t watch it.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.",,,Chandler,,,
" (with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (Chandler puts the tape in, and they all sit down) Okay, here we go.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why have I seen this thing three times?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Wait, you guys, look!",,,Chandler,,,
" No, the baby’s out! Look, look!",,,Chandler,,,
 And look how happy the mom is now!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) She’s growing inside you.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh! (Pulls his hand away.),,,Chandler,,,
 I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don’t think they exist.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why?,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Come on, don’t be crazy. (To Rachel) You don’t think there’s someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at him.)",,,Chandler,,,
" A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!",,,Chandler,,,
" Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.",,,Chandler,,,
 You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?,,,Chandler,,,
 (mouths to Phoebe) What?,,,Chandler,,,
 What’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.) On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still there’s staring.) No?,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you doing?!,,,Chandler,,,
" I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!",,,Chandler,,,
" Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?",,,Chandler,,,
" Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.",,,Chandler,,,
 Is it made of cheese?,,,Chandler,,,
 (disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?,,,Chandler,,,
 What do we do?,,,Chandler,,,
" Sure, why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.",,,Chandler,,,
" I’m sorry, did you say cheese?",,,Chandler,,,
" Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.",,,Chandler,,,
 No. But I’m sure (mimics Don) ‘tomatoes’ does.,,,Chandler,,,
 You don’t?,,,Chandler,,,
 So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?,,,Chandler,,,
 I love you.,,,Chandler,,,
 Y’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica doesn’t look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?,,,Chandler,,,
 What?! No! No!,,,Chandler,,,
" (incredulous) I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, ""I love you,"" was, ""Oh crap!""",,,Chandler,,,
 (interrupting him) We didn’t play it!!,,,Chandler,,,
 I didn’t know you read tea leaves.,,,Chandler,,,
 What does yours say Pheebs?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I’m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor’s.",,,Chandler,,,
" Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! (Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?",,,Chandler,,,
" I know it’s tough now, but things will get better.",,,Chandler,,,
" I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?",,,Chandler,,,
 Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.,,,Chandler,,,
 In the James Taylor case.,,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, I’m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?",,,Chandler,,,
 They were just giving those away at the store (off Monica’s look) in exchange for money.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.",,,Chandler,,,
 What problem did you tell him you had?,,,Chandler,,,
" (singing) The sun’ll come out…tomorrow! Bet…your bottom dollar that tomorrow… (The girls start laughing, and in a deep voice) …there’ll be sun.",,,Chandler,,,
 You can always sell your baby.,,,Chandler,,,
" Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they’re not in the baby buying business.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh I’m sorry, you’re kicking me out of my own living room?",,,Chandler,,,
 I’ll be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.),,,Chandler,,,
" Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (Sits up) Who said that?",,,Chandler,,,
 And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you doing?,,,Chandler,,,
 It’s a dog.,,,Chandler,,,
 It’s your parents’ anniversary and you’re going to talk about their dead pet?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, (Pause) and I think my testacles may be in here too.",,,Chandler,,,
 Ha!,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t think the flash went off.,,,Chandler,,,
 Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you doin’?,,,Chandler,,,
" Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could (Punches the air).",,,Chandler,,,
 If only there was something in your head to control the things you say. (Joey nods his agreement.),,,Chandler,,,
 Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?,,,Chandler,,,
" No, we’re just four people with neck problems. You talk like this. (Out of the sides of their mouths.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Nice work my friend.,,,Chandler,,,
 And a bagel with only…,,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?",,,Chandler,,,
 All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?,,,Chandler,,,
" Y’know what, we have to turn off the p0rn.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, ready?",,,Chandler,,,
 Two.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.",,,Chandler,,,
 You wanna see if we still have it?,,,Chandler,,,
 FREE p0rn!!!,,,Chandler,,,
 We have free p0rn here!!!,,,Chandler,,,
 What’s wrong with you?,,,Chandler,,,
 This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you—Go to the doctor!,,,Chandler,,,
 That’s still in there?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Stick to your side!,,,Chandler,,,
 Mento?,,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks.,,,Chandler,,,
 Well this one's for you.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, (Puts bracelet on Joey) it's about you and me and the fact that we're (Reading bracelet) best buds.",,,Chandler,,,
 That's what they'll call us.,,,Chandler,,,
 It hurts me. It physically hurts me.,,,Chandler,,,
 You’re turning into a woman.,,,Chandler,,,
 Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh my God, introduce us!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?,,,Chandler,,,
 That’s great.,,,Chandler,,,
 You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.",,,Chandler,,,
 Bamboozled?,,,Chandler,,,
 (simultaneously with Ross) No!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well Joey, I’m a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! (Waves.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Bogota.,,,Chandler,,,
 What does a Wicked Wango card do?,,,Chandler,,,
 Higher or lower than what?,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Ross) Can you believe how lame this is?,,,Chandler,,,
" This is ridiculous, he’s not gonna hold his breath… (Ross cuts him off by taking a deep breath and holding it.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Let me see that.,,,Chandler,,,
 Triscadecaphobia.,,,Chandler,,,
 Fear of Triscuts?,,,Chandler,,,
 This game makes no sense!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh come on Ross, I think we’re all losers here.",,,Chandler,,,
 Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.,,,Chandler,,,
" Either, it makes no difference.",,,Chandler,,,
 I’ll take a card.,,,Chandler,,,
 This game is kinda fun.,,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.,,,Chandler,,,
 Treasure of the Sierra Madre!,,,Chandler,,,
 Madre Sierra the of Treasure!,,,Chandler,,,
 I’d like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.,,,Chandler,,,
 Six!,,,Chandler,,,
 (disappointed and simultaneously as Ross) Hungry monkey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Tell it to the Time Turtle!,,,Chandler,,,
 (annoyed) Oh come on!!,,,Chandler,,,
 I’d like a Google Card.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes! (Pause) No! (Pause) Google!,,,Chandler,,,
 Nooo!!,,,Chandler,,,
 This is the best game ever!!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m so sorry.,,,Chandler,,,
 I have a job interview I have to get ready for.,,,Chandler,,,
" And people say you don’t pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It’s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.",,,Chandler,,,
 That’s what I do now.,,,Chandler,,,
" The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don’t ya?",,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I got a job interview. It’s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I’d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.",,,Chandler,,,
" Me! I do that. So… Seriously, do I look okay? I’m little nervous.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why not?,,,Chandler,,,
 What about it?,,,Chandler,,,
 (shocked) What?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you serious?!,,,Chandler,,,
 What is it that I do?,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?,,,Chandler,,,
 I can’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh good. Good, because I’m sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.",,,Chandler,,,
 An hour.,,,Chandler,,,
 Phoebe!,,,Chandler,,,
 Chandler Bing.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. (Pause) I’ll let myself out.",,,Chandler,,,
" …I think you’ll find if I come to work here, I don’t micro-manage. I don’t shy away from delegating.",,,Chandler,,,
" (suppressing a smile) What I do do…is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh! (Stands up.),,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 …also I was the point person on my company’s transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.,,,Chandler,,,
 That I did. That I did.,,,Chandler,,,
 (nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right.,,,Chandler,,,
 (trying not to laugh) I see.,,,Chandler,,,
 (really try not to laugh) Good to know.,,,Chandler,,,
 No don’t I beg of you!,,,Chandler,,,
 (relieved) Really?!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y’know I’ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesn’t understand) Duties. (Still doesn’t.) Duties! (Still doesn’t.) Poo. (Still doesn’t.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!",,,Chandler,,,
 I’ll look forward to your call. (Walks away.),,,Chandler,,,
 Let’s. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.),,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! Did you have the baby yet?,,,Chandler,,,
" He’s not snoozing, he’s teaching a class.",,,Chandler,,,
 I haven’t seen this dress.,,,Chandler,,,
 You really want to take me?,,,Chandler,,,
 So you’re never actually going to pay me back?,,,Chandler,,,
 I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.,,,Chandler,,,
" (in a manly voice) Yeah well, I’m gonna go spit. (He goes into the bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)",,,Chandler,,,
 This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 It’s just so glamorous.,,,Chandler,,,
 Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh-ho-ho, yeah!",,,Chandler,,,
 The whole thing! Can we go?,,,Chandler,,,
" I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!",,,Chandler,,,
 I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.,,,Chandler,,,
" Don’t go! I’m sorry. I’m so sorry! (Sees another guy who is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! (Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance.",,,Chandler,,,
 Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m so sorry.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
" You don’t owe me anything, I don’t want you money…",,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t know, five hundred dollars?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.",,,Chandler,,,
 Do you want a calculator?,,,Chandler,,,
 Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was right.),,,Chandler,,,
" Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes…",,,Chandler,,,
 Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, money well spent!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi!,,,Chandler,,,
" Man, if only you’d gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares at him.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay. I’ve been thinking about it too, and I, I think we’re ready.",,,Chandler,,,
 But you said you were ready too.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, but haven’t you wanted a kid like forever?",,,Chandler,,,
 I’m not crazy about babies. I’m crazy about us.,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, we’ve always talked about having babies someday. I’m not saying it has to be right now, but I’m starting to think that we can handle it. We’re good. We’re really good.",,,Chandler,,,
 But nothing has to happen until your ready.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?! It’s not right! We’re not ready to have a kid now!!,,,Chandler,,,
 I’m kidding. This is going to be fun.,,,Chandler,,,
" We’re trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandler stops it.) Y’know I’m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?",,,Chandler,,,
 Period math?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 Right here?,,,Chandler,,,
" Wait a minute, it’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we’re in a building that’s full of beds!",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (They start kissing.),,,Chandler,,,
" Okay. Uh, we’ll dim the lights, dim the lights. (He goes to the light switch and finds it’s not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. (He sprays an aerosol air freshener above her.)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, 98.6. You’re gonna be fine.",,,Chandler,,,
 Should we tell Rachel there’s an empty private room right next door to hers?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!",,,Chandler,,,
" If it’s not, then there’s two of them. And that would mean it’s the end of the world!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi.,,,Chandler,,,
 Weirdest thing. Did I hear—(A nurse opens the privacy screen and Chandler sees Janice)—Mother of God it’s true!,,,Chandler,,,
 Jan-Janice!,,,Chandler,,,
 Janice I didn’t even know you were pregnant! Who’s the unwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?,,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,,,
 That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?,,,Chandler,,,
" It’s incredible, I mean one minute she’s inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.",,,Chandler,,,
" So, do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?",,,Chandler,,,
 So then I guess Ferdinad is out.,,,Chandler,,,
 You do?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no, it’s gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn’t it?",,,Chandler,,,
 That was amazing.,,,Chandler,,,
" And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.",,,Chandler,,,
 He pulled a quarter out of my ear!,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. Wow.,,,Chandler,,,
 Sure.,,,Chandler,,,
 That was you?! I thought it was Jack!,,,Chandler,,,
 What?! Why does she think that?,,,Chandler,,,
" Again, what?!",,,Chandler,,,
 As we all are at some point during the day.,,,Chandler,,,
 Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?,,,Chandler,,,
 And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, what did she say?",,,Chandler,,,
 Does Ross know?,,,Chandler,,,
 Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.,,,Chandler,,,
" If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!",,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.",,,Chandler,,,
" I’m so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but no foreplay.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hello sir, you know Monica.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, we can’t stay in here forever.",,,Chandler,,,
" This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)",,,Chandler,,,
" I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn’t for fun.",,,Chandler,,,
" (To Monica) Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why… (To Mr. Geller) Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.",,,Chandler,,,
" That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.",,,Chandler,,,
" Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.",,,Chandler,,,
 You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?,,,Chandler,,,
" Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look like?!",,,Chandler,,,
 Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, look, just do it gently.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yea yea. (Pulls the balloon out of his mouth),,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office (Pulls another balloon out of his mouth) Am I producing them?",,,Chandler,,,
" Couldn’t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn’t sleep. Y’know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I’ll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn’t fall asleep.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.",,,Chandler,,,
 Walter (nods).,,,Chandler,,,
 Yep.,,,Chandler,,,
 (not knowing what he’s saying yes to) Yes.,,,Chandler,,,
 (enters) Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?,,,Chandler,,,
 Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing,,,Chandler,,,
" Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?",,,Chandler,,,
 People who’ve never ever been to Paris.,,,Chandler,,,
 We’re moving to Tulsa! (Makes a excited expression on his face),,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.",,,Chandler,,,
" The Sooner State, whatever that is.",,,Chandler,,,
 Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monica’s not impressed.) I’ll get out of it.",,,Chandler,,,
 (hears Emma crying) What is wrong with Emma?,,,Chandler,,,
" Umm ma’am, do you have a minute? (She points for him to come in) I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.",,,Chandler,,,
" It’s a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really know what I was saying.",,,Chandler,,,
" But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, here’s the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go there!",,,Chandler,,,
" No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (She glares at him.) That’s a picture of your daughter, isn’t it, well she’s lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I’ll call you from Tulsa. (Exits.)",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering, loudly) Hey!",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh so there can’t be any yelling.,,,Chandler,,,
 We’re moving to Tulsa,,,Chandler,,,
" Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! (Walks backwards towards the door) I can’t, I can’t hear you. (He runs out)",,,Chandler,,,
" (enters) Hey, what you guys talking about?",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.",,,Chandler,,,
 They said it could be up to a year.,,,Chandler,,,
" There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.",,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
 (Enters) Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 I've got good news!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?",,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
 That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, you said that without gagging!",,,Chandler,,,
 I know what she's talking about.,,,Chandler,,,
 He saw a therapist?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.,,,Chandler,,,
 Slim Pickings.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.",,,Chandler,,,
 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.,,,Chandler,,,
 Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.,,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 How far outside?,,,Chandler,,,
" And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job.",,,Chandler,,,
 What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?,,,Chandler,,,
 I think you should take the job.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?,,,Chandler,,,
 Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?,,,Chandler,,,
 That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy. (They hug)",,,Chandler,,,
 Of course I will call you. I love you.,,,Chandler,,,
 Awww. (They hug) Bye!,,,Chandler,,,
 (Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the matter Joe?,,,Chandler,,,
 Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!",,,Chandler,,,
 I know.,,,Chandler,,,
 I know that too. (They kiss),,,Chandler,,,
" (On cell phone) Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.",,,Chandler,,,
" (enters singing) Oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plane, STOP IT! Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas? 7 o clock maybe I'll hit the gym (sits down) who am I kidding pay-per-view p0rn.",,,Chandler,,,
 DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica: (smiles),,,Chandler,,,
" everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise. (She hugs him, and she knows what he was doing so she looks at the TV and sees sharks swimming around thinking Chandler was giving himself a treat to sharks.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Ok honey. that was close.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hi honey I'm home!,,,Chandler,,,
 oh it was great.,,,Chandler,,,
" well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!",,,Chandler,,,
 (Chandler looking confused) Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.,,,Chandler,,,
 no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.,,,Chandler,,,
 does what always have to be sharks.,,,Chandler,,,
 What's going on?,,,Chandler,,,
 let ME be a part of this!,,,Chandler,,,
 no they don't,,,Chandler,,,
" OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular p0rn",,,Chandler,,,
 yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.,,,Chandler,,,
" You are an amazing wife. (Monica shrugs) No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.",,,Chandler,,,
" Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? (colleague raises hand) Yes, Ken is it?",,,Chandler,,,
" (laughs) Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. (to everyone:) You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?",,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, lo...look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. (everyone lights) So you all smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not.",,,Chandler,,,
" (loud) Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.",,,Chandler,,,
" I always liked you, Ken. (takes a cig)",,,Chandler,,,
" Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.",,,Chandler,,,
" No! I just happened t'do a lot trivia's about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.",,,Chandler,,,
" Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?",,,Chandler,,,
 Pheebs?,,,Chandler,,,
" (getting in) Okay, something to cover the smell ... Oven cleaner! (sprays himself, reads label) Unscented!",,,Chandler,,,
" No thanks, I'm good.",,,Chandler,,,
" (shrinks back) Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.",,,Chandler,,,
" (still backs away) Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulence's.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two pack...a...a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. (How many cigs are there in one pack and how many packs in one carton in the US?) But it's over, I made a decision, I'm not gonna smoke anymore.",,,Chandler,,,
" But, those are for you.",,,Chandler,,,
" I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.",,,Chandler,,,
 Will power? I've watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs (?) without taking the tin foil off.,,,Chandler,,,
" 'kay, look: Can we just drop this? I'm not gonna smoke again.",,,Chandler,,,
 You forbid me?,,,Chandler,,,
" You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?",,,Chandler,,,
" Then, I might as well ... (grabs the cigs) do this (lights one, exhales). Not really sure what to do now.",,,Chandler,,,
 Fine. What!?,,,Chandler,,,
 You serious? (follows),,,Chandler,,,
" Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking.",,,Chandler,,,
 And no kissing your neck.,,,Chandler,,,
 And lots of kissing your neck.,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I can't do this. I can't make love to you while we're fighting this way.",,,Chandler,,,
" That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?",,,Chandler,,,
 Mean it?,,,Chandler,,,
" You are incredible. Unless, I...I'm not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, let's celebrate life!",,,Chandler,,,
 Uhh. You are welcome.,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes--no big deal.,,,Chandler,,,
 Leave it.,,,Chandler,,,
 You tricked me to get me into bed?,,,Chandler,,,
 I feel so used.,,,Chandler,,,
 I would never lie to get someone into bed.,,,Chandler,,,
 I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.,,,Chandler,,,
 You mean the lully story?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Joey) You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having s*x with her.,,,Chandler,,,
 What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?,,,Chandler,,,
" So you never had s*x with a Kennedy, have you?",,,Chandler,,,
" (picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog in his throat) Hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog in his throat when he speaks again) Hello?",,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, you're screaming.",,,Chandler,,,
" (yawning) Oh, that's great.",,,Chandler,,,
 (clearly not so interested) Awesome.,,,Chandler,,,
" (angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) Save it for inside! (he enters)",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.",,,Chandler,,,
" (laughs, but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.",,,Chandler,,,
" What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? (Monica laughs) See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, he came up...",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Phoebe) Were you there?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.",,,Chandler,,,
" (Can't believe what he hears) Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.",,,Chandler,,,
 Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah!,,,Chandler,,,
" Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you guys talking about?,,,Chandler,,,
" You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? (Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler seems happy again.)",,,Chandler,,,
" You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)",,,Chandler,,,
" If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)",,,Chandler,,,
 What is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke),,,Chandler,,,
" Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)",,,Chandler,,,
 So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and Ross walk away from the kitchen),,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?,,,Chandler,,,
" I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at http://www.hahanotsomuch.com/.",,,Chandler,,,
" Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!",,,Chandler,,,
 I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the back.),,,Chandler,,,
 See ya! (he leaves the apartment),,,Chandler,,,
 Hi!,,,Chandler,,,
 How come?,,,Chandler,,,
 Do you have any ideas?,,,Chandler,,,
" (imitating Monica) Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club",,,Chandler,,,
 So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical,,,Chandler,,,
 mmm That's enough about you!,,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a",,,Chandler,,,
 We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this,,,Chandler,,,
 (Chandler looks around the place and his eye gets caught by,,,Chandler,,,
 There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.,,,Chandler,,,
 Get there faster! (Joey gasps and finally understands...),,,Chandler,,,
" I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what",,,Chandler,,,
" Don't judge me, I'm only human!",,,Chandler,,,
" I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape",,,Chandler,,,
 Some girl...!?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah...!?,,,Chandler,,,
" Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not",,,Chandler,,,
 Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.,,,Chandler,,,
" Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?",,,Chandler,,,
 Why am I hearing cheering?,,,Chandler,,,
 Football? Just football?,,,Chandler,,,
 It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the,,,Chandler,,,
 Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the p0rn star!,,,Chandler,,,
" Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard",,,Chandler,,,
 This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.",,,Chandler,,,
 What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!,,,Chandler,,,
 Is that a problem?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?",,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.",,,Chandler,,,
 What is the point of having them if we never use them?,,,Chandler,,,
 I will explain it to her.,,,Chandler,,,
 Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!,,,Chandler,,,
 Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you going to do?,,,Chandler,,,
 Well you proved them wrong.,,,Chandler,,,
" I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..",,,Chandler,,,
 Why?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?",,,Chandler,,,
 I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.,,,Chandler,,,
" You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>",,,Chandler,,,
" No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?",,,Chandler,,,
 Actually what?,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?",,,Chandler,,,
 Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?",,,Chandler,,,
 Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up.,,,Chandler,,,
" So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""Go to your room! You're grounded""?",,,Chandler,,,
 You said that to me last week.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.",,,Chandler,,,
" Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.,,,Chandler,,,
" By the way, that fight was totally arousing.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yeah? Well thanks.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.",,,Chandler,,,
 Nope...,,,Chandler,,,
 Yep...,,,Chandler,,,
" Nope... (Monica walks in) Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.",,,Chandler,,,
 Maybe not even then. (Joey walks in),,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah. That’s a lot of cats, Jolene. Single, are ya?",,,Chandler,,,
 Chandler Bing.,,,Chandler,,,
" What’s up, Joe?",,,Chandler,,,
 Braid each other’s hair then ride horseback on the beach?,,,Chandler,,,
 Courtside? Oh my god!!,,,Chandler,,,
 That is so cool. I’ll let Monica know.,,,Chandler,,,
 Joey just called. He’s got courtside Knicks tickets for me and him tomorrow night.,,,Chandler,,,
 But-t it’s courtside! The cheerleaders are gonna be right in … [mouths last words so Monica does not hear them]. That’s not the way to convince you.,,,Chandler,,,
 I…I…I know. You’re right. I wanna see you too. I’ve just got to figure out a way to tell Joey. He’s really looking forward to this.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, yeah, yeah. I’ll think of something.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, well, look at you!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it’s great, well, I’m just wearing the same thing underneath! Look at you.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Joey can’t know that I am here.",,,Chandler,,,
" Because I didn’t know how to tell him that I couldn’t go to the Knicks game, so I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.",,,Chandler,,,
" Eh, it is always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion. [Monica glares at him] Except with you!",,,Chandler,,,
" You know, it’s funny. I’ve been practising the art of seduction as well! Hya! [Does a wiggle]",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. [Chandler’s phone goes off] It’s Joey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, Joe!",,,Chandler,,,
 What? Why?,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I can’t. What’s going on?",,,Chandler,,,
 [Loudly] No!,,,Chandler,,,
 [Quiet] Can you hear him now?,,,Chandler,,,
 [Loudly] No! Wait!,,,Chandler,,,
 Right. Just stay there. I'm coming home.,,,Chandler,,,
 Is that really necessary?,,,Chandler,,,
 Don’t you think it’s better for him to think that you’re cheating on me than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? [Silence] I heard it!,,,Chandler,,,
 Alright. I’ve got a plan. I’ll go down the fire escape…,,,Chandler,,,
" Hear me out, woman! I’ll go down the fire escape, then I’ll wait for a while. Then, when I come back up the stairs, it’ll just be like I got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in here and see that there is no guy in here.",,,Chandler,,,
 Just gonna wait for a little while.,,,Chandler,,,
 It’s huge!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well,… you’re forgetting about the time difference.",,,Chandler,,,
" That’s right. Your husband’s home, so now the s*x can stop.",,,Chandler,,,
 Joey said that you’re in here with another man!,,,Chandler,,,
 What’s he doing?,,,Chandler,,,
" Alright, well, I’ll check the guest bedroom.",,,Chandler,,,
" Nobody here, Joe.",,,Chandler,,,
" I climb down the fire escape, and you can’t put that in the closet?",,,Chandler,,,
 I’m sorry. I told you that I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I didn’t…didn’t know…didn’t think you’d understand.,,,Chandler,,,
" I feel so bad. Is there, is there anything I can do to make it up to you?",,,Chandler,,,
 I’m sorry. That’s the one thing I can’t do. I promised that I’d be with Monica.,,,Chandler,,,
 [Turning around] What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Really? Are you going to be okay?,,,Chandler,,,
" You’re gonna put sweats on and clean, aren’t ya?",,,Chandler,,,
" Thanks. Listen, I’m never gonna lie to you again.",,,Chandler,,,
 And I want you to know that no-one thinks that you are stupid.,,,Chandler,,,
" Game’s tomorrow night, Joe. [Enters apartment]",,,Chandler,,,
" (coming from the bedroom) Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by",,,Chandler,,,
" So, who does?",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm sorry I won't be here.,,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks. (they kiss) I'll see you new year's day.,,,Chandler,,,
 Did I not mention that?,,,Chandler,,,
" (thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming:)",,,Chandler,,,
" All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas eve and you'd",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey. Where've you been?,,,Chandler,,,
" (to the others) You hear that? You may not be with your familys,",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with",,,Chandler,,,
" Haha, no thanks!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a",,,Chandler,,,
" Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty",,,Chandler,,,
" I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.",,,Chandler,,,
 What? That's terrible!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.",,,Chandler,,,
" No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!",,,Chandler,,,
" No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why?,,,Chandler,,,
" No, I have a great idea for a present for her.",,,Chandler,,,
" If I help, we can find 'em faster!",,,Chandler,,,
" OK, Pheebs, your turn.",,,Chandler,,,
" And, a lemon lime.",,,Chandler,,,
 And last but not least.,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.),,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a,,,Chandler,,,
 Why?,,,Chandler,,,
 But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.,,,Chandler,,,
" Fine, I'll give the suit back.",,,Chandler,,,
 Santa? Really?,,,Chandler,,,
 Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?,,,Chandler,,,
 Then it's okaaay! (They kiss.),,,Chandler,,,
" You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your",,,Chandler,,,
" Good, God's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door,",,,Chandler,,,
 Ah. Thanks.,,,Chandler,,,
 Ah. (The phone rings; he answers it) Chandler Bing.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ahh, merry Christmas; I miss you guys!",,,Chandler,,,
" Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.",,,Chandler,,,
 It is. Did I... not tell you about her?,,,Chandler,,,
 I send them home.,,,Chandler,,,
" Uhh, uh...",,,Chandler,,,
 I don't know!,,,Chandler,,,
" I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.",,,Chandler,,,
 BE-LOW me!,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, she... she didn't win...",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in",,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm serious!,,,Chandler,,,
 Merry Christmas.,,,Chandler,,,
" Merry Christmas, you guys!",,,Chandler,,,
" (hanging up the phone) The wife says ""Hi!"".",,,Chandler,,,
" Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just",,,Chandler,,,
" This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but...",,,Chandler,,,
" Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! (He takes a step back, but she still",,,Chandler,,,
 I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ...,,,Chandler,,,
" (flattered) No,... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm *happily* married.,,,Chandler,,,
" Right. So, I'm sorry...",,,Chandler,,,
" Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know.",,,Chandler,,,
" I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!",,,Chandler,,,
 You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...,,,Chandler,,,
 But we don't do that.,,,Chandler,,,
 How drunk are you?,,,Chandler,,,
 (thinks) That's the perfect amount!,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 I know.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay!,,,Chandler,,,
 It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yep!,,,Chandler,,,
 Count of three?,,,Chandler,,,
 Two!,,,Chandler,,,
 Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively,,,Chandler,,,
 Eh! (They start making out again),,,Chandler,,,
" So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing",,,Chandler,,,
" Really? Okay, so...",,,Chandler,,,
" Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?",,,Chandler,,,
 Right!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue",,,Chandler,,,
 Let's go! (Starts to leave.),,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was",,,Chandler,,,
 I don't think so.,,,Chandler,,,
 (looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.),,,Chandler,,,
" No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)",,,Chandler,,,
 Ehh.,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I",,,Chandler,,,
" Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
" Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place",,,Chandler,,,
 Sure you do.,,,Chandler,,,
 You sure?,,,Chandler,,,
 I love you so much.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.,,,Chandler,,,
 Monica.,,,Chandler,,,
 I never want to leave you again!,,,Chandler,,,
 Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you.",,,Chandler,,,
 (realizing) I have *not* thought this through!,,,Chandler,,,
" I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.",,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks!,,,Chandler,,,
 (flattered) Ahh...,,,Chandler,,,
" (to Monica) Here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)",,,Chandler,,,
 I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other,,,Chandler,,,
 I don't have a *job*!,,,Chandler,,,
 Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.,,,Chandler,,,
" I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?",,,Chandler,,,
 But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!,,,Chandler,,,
 How long was I in there?,,,Chandler,,,
 Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!,,,Chandler,,,
" I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.",,,Chandler,,,
" I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? ""Cheese. It's milk that you chew."" ""Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy."" ""A grape.",,,Chandler,,,
 Honey? Leave it to the pros.,,,Chandler,,,
" ""The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones.""",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no. But let me show you what I can do. ""Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood.""",,,Chandler,,,
 Really? That's great!,,,Chandler,,,
" It's funny. When you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid.""",,,Chandler,,,
" Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have s*x tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right",,,Chandler,,,
" Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, Ross is here so...",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.",,,Chandler,,,
 That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.,,,Chandler,,,
" That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little",,,Chandler,,,
 Or a year?,,,Chandler,,,
" It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. ""Pants. Like shorts, but longer."" (Pause) It'll probably be more than a year.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.",,,Chandler,,,
 I quit and you learn what I do?,,,Chandler,,,
 I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.,,,Chandler,,,
 Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.",,,Chandler,,,
" I tried, but apparantly singing ""I will survive"" in a helium voice - not helping.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.",,,Chandler,,,
 Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.,,,Chandler,,,
 Now that Rachel's gone?,,,Chandler,,,
 I wasn't staring. I was leering.,,,Chandler,,,
 Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.,,,Chandler,,,
" Seriously dude, 3 years ago.",,,Chandler,,,
 You don't trust him?,,,Chandler,,,
" Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.",,,Chandler,,,
" Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have s*x with it.",,,Chandler,,,
 Picturing that tree?,,,Chandler,,,
" Where you going, Joe?",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh. You mind if I join you?,,,Chandler,,,
 Your thoughts? Plural?,,,Chandler,,,
" I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.",,,Chandler,,,
 Great novels?,,,Chandler,,,
" (In a helium voice, holding a balloon) I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.",,,Chandler,,,
" (still helium voice) Right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the door)",,,Chandler,,,
" (sings in a helium voice) First I was afraid, I was petrified (very happy)",,,Chandler,,,
 (normal voice) Hi,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, well someone left this (shows a green jacket). This is yours?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever,,,Chandler,,,
 No!,,,Chandler,,,
 Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said,,,Chandler,,,
 So are you gonna...talk to her?,,,Chandler,,,
" You know when ""That's fine"" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!",,,Chandler,,,
 No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?,,,Chandler,,,
" Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!",,,Chandler,,,
 Why did I get married?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,",,,Chandler,,,
 What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!,,,Chandler,,,
" Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing",,,Chandler,,,
 Did she go out with him?,,,Chandler,,,
 Ah! The high road...,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you trying to get everybody divorced?,,,Chandler,,,
 I thought I had to make the jokes!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it.",,,Chandler,,,
 We still got it!,,,Chandler,,,
" I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed",,,Chandler,,,
 By drowning or...?!,,,Chandler,,,
 Well...,,,Chandler,,,
" Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?",,,Chandler,,,
" I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!",,,Chandler,,,
 It’s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!,,,Chandler,,,
" Ok. First of all, this is green!",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well, I guess you don’t need my help Victor Victoria!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.",,,Chandler,,,
 And done!,,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about",,,Chandler,,,
 No problem.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 I am sorry I am late. You’ll understand when you’ll see Joey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Really? In front of all this people?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
 Are those my wife’s nipples?,,,Chandler,,,
 I gotta stop this.,,,Chandler,,,
" You, touching yourself, out!",,,Chandler,,,
" “Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped him",,,Chandler,,,
" See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.",,,Chandler,,,
 Wow.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!",,,Chandler,,,
" Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!",,,Chandler,,,
 I don't do that.,,,Chandler,,,
" I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?",,,Chandler,,,
 Today is the sixth.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, it's also 2003.",,,Chandler,,,
 It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Tough crib.,,,Chandler,,,
 I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.,,,Chandler,,,
 I am not working. There's not much to do around here!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not. ",,,Chandler,,,
 I - I don't think I can.,,,Chandler,,,
 Because of Emma.,,,Chandler,,,
 Sorry.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front of the B-A-B-Y.",,,Chandler,,,
 Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?,,,Chandler,,,
" You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have s*x with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.",,,Chandler,,,
 Emma was doing it!,,,Chandler,,,
" Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...",,,Chandler,,,
 I think we may have really done it this time.,,,Chandler,,,
 You may wanna get some more of those too.,,,Chandler,,,
 Where's Emma?,,,Chandler,,,
" Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (Runs out.),,,Chandler,,,
" All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no, no.",,,Chandler,,,
 What? Why?,,,Chandler,,,
 Your family name is Tribbiani.,,,Chandler,,,
" (excited) Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what…",,,Chandler,,,
 Thank you. I got a job in advertising. (Everybody cheers),,,Chandler,,,
" Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.",,,Chandler,,,
" Right. So, it'll be the same except… less s*x with you. (Joey nods)",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating ",,,Chandler,,,
 (grinning awkwardly) Humiliating and noble!,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering) Good morning, everybody.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys… except for the tie, the briefcase… and the fact that I can rent a car.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.",,,Chandler,,,
" Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope (he sits down) ",,,Chandler,,,
 The comedian? USO?!,,,Chandler,,,
" (entering, carrying a large box) Honey, I'm old!",,,Chandler,,,
 I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, but I don't think life experience with these. (He opens the box and takes an inline skate-like sneaker out)",,,Chandler,,,
 They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.,,,Chandler,,,
 What am I supposed to do with these?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, first of all, they're not called ""sneakers"" anymore. Apparently, they're called ""kicks"" or ""skids"" and I think I heard somebody say ""slorps"". (He takes a sneaker) And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! (to Monica) Would you help me try to sell these?",,,Chandler,,,
" No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for. ",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Putting on the sneakers… thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything…",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!",,,Chandler,,,
 (sitting on the couch) You know what… these aren't half-bad! (to Rachel) You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.,,,Chandler,,,
 Alright (He stands wearing the sneakers on) I feel younger already! ,,,Chandler,,,
" (on the floor) Yah, I think I broke my hip.",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay… (He stands up) You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age…,,,Chandler,,,
" A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: ""Not suitable for adults!"" ",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, thank you, sir… or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me (He sits down again)",,,Chandler,,,
" (over-enthusiastic) I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.",,,Chandler,,,
 The cold weather hurts my hip!,,,Chandler,,,
 Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?,,,Chandler,,,
" I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.",,,Chandler,,,
 Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.,,,Chandler,,,
 You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?,,,Chandler,,,
 No! We're not borrowing money.,,,Chandler,,,
 Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.,,,Chandler,,,
 That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.... she's not so cute.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes dear.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Joe!,,,Chandler,,,
 Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.,,,Chandler,,,
 And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.,,,Chandler,,,
 What? What do you mean you know?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh! Right.,,,Chandler,,,
" Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! (Joey begins writing a cheque),,,Chandler,,,
 Oh ok.,,,Chandler,,,
 I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.,,,Chandler,,,
" No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.",,,Chandler,,,
" I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. (kisses monica) Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
 But honey you don't have to.,,,Chandler,,,
 Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!,,,Chandler,,,
 your ass?!?!?,,,Chandler,,,
 They...do that?,,,Chandler,,,
 God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?,,,Chandler,,,
" Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?",,,Chandler,,,
 (sedated) What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.",,,Chandler,,,
 Aaaaand....... hernia.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you. (they hug again)",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! Ready to go?,,,Chandler,,,
 What are you doin'?,,,Chandler,,,
" Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .",,,Chandler,,,
 The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?,,,Chandler,,,
 Bet she'd sleep with you now...,,,Chandler,,,
" Let me see what you wrote about yourself: ""Doctor Paleontology, two kids... "" (pause) You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!",,,Chandler,,,
" Maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on Ross' computer) ""Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best s*x I've ever had""... aaand SEND!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I'm so sorry!",,,Chandler,,,
 You're not gonna need my help?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)",,,Chandler,,,
 I believe I read that somewhere!,,,Chandler,,,
 I respectfully disagree.,,,Chandler,,,
 Who cares? Nobody reads those things,,,Chandler,,,
 I don't have a page.,,,Chandler,,,
 Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.,,,Chandler,,,
 Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! (Monica hangs up) I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something).",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, you'll see my friend.",,,Chandler,,,
 (faking sympathy) And so young.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, how you died was funny.",,,Chandler,,,
 It kills over one americans every year.,,,Chandler,,,
 You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?",,,Chandler,,,
 Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?,,,Chandler,,,
" No, come on, you know that's not true.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.",,,Chandler,,,
" Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.",,,Chandler,,,
" Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?",,,Chandler,,,
" Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !",,,Chandler,,,
 There you go! Someone came!,,,Chandler,,,
" (in a mournful voice) Please, come in.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.",,,Chandler,,,
 At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom),,,Chandler,,,
" Some guy, Tom Gordon.",,,Chandler,,,
" (entering, very upset) Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)",,,Chandler,,,
 Ok! (shuts the door behind Tom),,,Chandler,,,
" Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!",,,Chandler,,,
" You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. (Ross hides in the bedroom again)",,,Chandler,,,
 Kori? Kori Weston?,,,Chandler,,,
 Wow! You look amazing!,,,Chandler,,,
" Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.",,,Chandler,,,
" Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)",,,Chandler,,,
 I didn't know Ross and you were so close.,,,Chandler,,,
" I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!",,,Chandler,,,
 Still on Amelia Earhart?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.,,,Chandler,,,
 (looking around at the others)I'll ask. (To Ross) Boohaki?,,,Chandler,,,
 Kinda like Joey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Pie eating contest?,,,Chandler,,,
" No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.",,,Chandler,,,
" (hysterical)Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!! (picks up the phone)",,,Chandler,,,
" (into receiver)Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?",,,Chandler,,,
 (still on the phone)Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.,,,Chandler,,,
 One of the slots got filled.,,,Chandler,,,
 Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah I know.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.",,,Chandler,,,
" I can see the headline now: ""Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm"".",,,Chandler,,,
" Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?",,,Chandler,,,
 Ooh! Calm down ...,,,Chandler,,,
" You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.",,,Chandler,,,
" You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.",,,Chandler,,,
 (looks around) I'll take this one too (to Ross) Uh ... Mommy?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye. (hangs up)",,,Chandler,,,
" Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.",,,Chandler,,,
 He's the boss's son.,,,Chandler,,,
 What about the ones you have on the nightstand?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.",,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Mon) She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...",,,Chandler,,,
" Let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from Rachel)",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!",,,Chandler,,,
" Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...",,,Chandler,,,
" (looking at the answering machine) Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)",,,Chandler,,,
 This is..shhh!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. (pause) But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?",,,Chandler,,,
 I got that!,,,Chandler,,,
 No.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ah, the ""I'm sorry I rejected you"" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. (on the phone, getting up from the sofa) Hey, Steve.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!",,,Chandler,,,
" Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow (hangs up).",,,Chandler,,,
" What? (pause) Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.",,,Chandler,,,
 Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?,,,Chandler,,,
" Thanks, man.",,,Chandler,,,
 Really? What?,,,Chandler,,,
" (smiling, surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards the kitchen, worried) Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.",,,Chandler,,,
" Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.",,,Chandler,,,
 Me too.,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!,,,Chandler,,,
" What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont (shows them a brochure)!",,,Chandler,,,
" So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?",,,Chandler,,,
 Are you really that busy?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) ""Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it (pause) Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? (pause) Oh, can't you make an exception?""",,,Chandler,,,
" (on the phone) ""Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?"" (pause) ""Oh, thank you very much!"" (hangs up) Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...",,,Chandler,,,
 I don't have travel insurance.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.",,,Chandler,,,
 New York.,,,Chandler,,,
" I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?",,,Chandler,,,
" Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?",,,Chandler,,,
 Just give us the cheapest room you have.,,,Chandler,,,
 That's insane!,,,Chandler,,,
 Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? (pause) We'll take it.,,,Chandler,,,
" (aside, to Ross) What!? They are totally ripping us off!",,,Chandler,,,
" Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!",,,Chandler,,,
" Dude, you're shaking!",,,Chandler,,,
 USA Today,,,Chandler,,,
 And I also got... two more apples.,,,Chandler,,,
 I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.,,,Chandler,,,
" I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, but the batteries...",,,Chandler,,,
" Thank you, thank you very much!",,,Chandler,,,
 No!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, we have enough, just walk away.",,,Chandler,,,
 There's a forest right outside.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, go quick!",,,Chandler,,,
 I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table),,,Chandler,,,
" (browsing through a diary) Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.",,,Chandler,,,
 I could fall asleep at a play.,,,Chandler,,,
" (browsing through a diary) Uh, let's see, who do I hate?",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.",,,Chandler,,,
 Where the hell is everybody?,,,Chandler,,,
" (To himself) oh yes, God yes!!",,,Chandler,,,
 I... I don't know... you seem lovely.,,,Chandler,,,
" (to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play?",,,Chandler,,,
 Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16: ""fat, single and ready to mingle"", I was uplifted.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!",,,Chandler,,,
 Did somebody sign your bra?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.",,,Chandler,,,
" Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away).",,,Chandler,,,
" I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Joey) So, a professor, uh?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites Monica to have s*x on it)",,,Chandler,,,
 We really need to take those tests?,,,Chandler,,,
 But I don't wanna do it in a cup!,,,Chandler,,,
 It's weird! In a doctor's office?,,,Chandler,,,
" (embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause) And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!",,,Chandler,,,
 I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.,,,Chandler,,,
" Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I guess!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, Come on!",,,Chandler,,,
 Why are you here?,,,Chandler,,,
" (to Heaven) No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??",,,Chandler,,,
 What!?,,,Chandler,,,
" I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got a hot date... (starts to leave)",,,Chandler,,,
 (disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves),,,Chandler,,,
 (To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!,,,Chandler,,,
 I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.,,,Chandler,,,
" (Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?",,,Chandler,,,
" (smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...",,,Chandler,,,
" (stares at her intently, then yells) It was a ""Wendy's!! """,,,Chandler,,,
 (picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause) Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)",,,Chandler,,,
 Doctor Connelly just called.,,,Chandler,,,
 Actually it's both of us.,,,Chandler,,,
 Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.,,,Chandler,,,
 It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It means...,,,Chandler,,,
" (seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm sorry.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.",,,Chandler,,,
 (looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hi.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, DAMN IT!",,,Chandler,,,
" Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!",,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hey guys!,,,Chandler,,,
" I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.",,,Chandler,,,
 But you come first!,,,Chandler,,,
 (sitting down on the couch) Ok.,,,Chandler,,,
 Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get p0rn if you're giving a sperm sample.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
" Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.",,,Chandler,,,
 (stopping Joey) ah-ha!,,,Chandler,,,
 I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!",,,Chandler,,,
" You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! (pause) Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Mon) So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?",,,Chandler,,,
" So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is ""spermtastic""!",,,Chandler,,,
" No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!",,,Chandler,,,
 Ok!,,,Chandler,,,
 (bringing the beer to Zack) Zack!,,,Chandler,,,
" So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!",,,Chandler,,,
 You don't like him.,,,Chandler,,,
 Alright! Just follow my lead!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?",,,Chandler,,,
 (very seriously) That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.,,,Chandler,,,
" You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness (Monica stretches her neck to look behind Zack's head and then gives Chandler an ""ok"" sign)",,,Chandler,,,
 I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?,,,Chandler,,,
 (Proceeding with his dinner) We're teeth people Zack!,,,Chandler,,,
 You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?,,,Chandler,,,
" Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.",,,Chandler,,,
 Ok.,,,Chandler,,,
 I think we've found our sperm!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?",,,Chandler,,,
" Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, he's better!",,,Chandler,,,
 Really? Are you sure?,,,Chandler,,,
" (sighs with relief) Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.",,,Chandler,,,
 So you know this leaves us with...,,,Chandler,,,
 How do you feel about that?,,,Chandler,,,
 Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.,,,Chandler,,,
 (smiling) Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 We are gonna be great parents.,,,Chandler,,,
" Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, Zack!",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.",,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
" My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.",,,Chandler,,,
" You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff"".",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind"".",,,Chandler,,,
 (upset) She does?,,,Chandler,,,
 I wouldn't read too much into it.,,,Chandler,,,
" David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.",,,Chandler,,,
" Seriously, we're gonna do this?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, because his pen1s was too big. (he notices that David is not amused) Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. (pause) They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 I didn't mean now...,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.",,,Chandler,,,
" David, I'm pretending to read here!!",,,Chandler,,,
" (smiling cheekily) I do! Want a hint? huh? ""I do"" (Monica looks confused, so Chandler repeats) ""I do"".",,,Chandler,,,
 David is going to propose to Phoebe.,,,Chandler,,,
" Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.",,,Chandler,,,
" I did! A pen1s one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?",,,Chandler,,,
" Man, that's some bad advice!",,,Chandler,,,
 That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!,,,Chandler,,,
" Tonight?! (looks at the ring) Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) Oh, there it is!",,,Chandler,,,
 (slaps him on the shoulder) Nice! (goes to Monica),,,Chandler,,,
" Monica, can I talk to you for a sec? (Pulls her away from Phoebe and Rachel)",,,Chandler,,,
 David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!,,,Chandler,,,
 That would be advice!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?",,,Chandler,,,
 (offended) What? (pause) May I?,,,Chandler,,,
" (at the laptop) Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!",,,Chandler,,,
" Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!",,,Chandler,,,
 It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.,,,Chandler,,,
 Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it didn't say ""This is a virus""!!",,,Chandler,,,
 Nude... (Ross looks at him)... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.,,,Chandler,,,
" It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!",,,Chandler,,,
 I just feel awful.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... (Ross glares at him) you know, you and Monica have the same ""I'm gonna kill you"" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... (Ross continues to glare at him and Chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss Ross)",,,Chandler,,,
" (pretending not to sense the tone) Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!",,,Chandler,,,
" Phoebe is going to say ""yes""? That's, that's great!",,,Chandler,,,
 And there's not chance that will work?,,,Chandler,,,
 (pointing at her) Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!,,,Chandler,,,
 This vacation sucks!!,,,Chandler,,,
" You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.",,,Chandler,,,
" I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? (doing David) ""Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..."" Spit it out, David!",,,Chandler,,,
" I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! Remember when I had corneas?,,,Chandler,,,
 Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.,,,Chandler,,,
 (to a paleontologist sitting next to him) Not to mention the cold sores.,,,Chandler,,,
 (to the one sitting next to him) Really?,,,Chandler,,,
 I don't think so!,,,Chandler,,,
" Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?",,,Chandler,,,
 And...?,,,Chandler,,,
 I'm not playing with you.,,,Chandler,,,
 She gets crazy! This scar (points to his forehead) is from Pictionary!,,,Chandler,,,
" (nearly whispering) Oh dear God, there's two of them!",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Phoebe) Did you know this about him?,,,Chandler,,,
 (interrupting her) OK!,,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Phoebe) Do you really find this attractive on him?,,,Chandler,,,
 I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.",,,Chandler,,,
 Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?,,,Chandler,,,
" (exhausted) Ok, look! Enough is enough!",,,Chandler,,,
" Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!",,,Chandler,,,
 But...,,,Chandler,,,
 What about the obsessive cleaning?,,,Chandler,,,
 You ok?,,,Chandler,,,
" No, you didn't.",,,Chandler,,,
 Because I'm gonna play for ya.,,,Chandler,,,
" (In a loving voice) Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.",,,Chandler,,,
" (Still in a loving voice) You're welcome, sweetheart.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.",,,Chandler,,,
 And that's... how... it's done!,,,Chandler,,,
" I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!",,,Chandler,,,
 I don't know.,,,Chandler,,,
 That's why!,,,Chandler,,,
" You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.",,,Chandler,,,
 You're on!,,,Chandler,,,
" He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.",,,Chandler,,,
 She's cheating on Joey with Ross!,,,Chandler,,,
 Wow!,,,Chandler,,,
 How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!,,,Chandler,,,
 Anything?,,,Chandler,,,
 You do realise that's your brother?,,,Chandler,,,
 That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay Buckwheat!,,,Chandler,,,
 And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!,,,Chandler,,,
 (caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!,,,Chandler,,,
 He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica),,,Chandler,,,
 You got it!,,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?",,,Chandler,,,
 Enunciate!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.",,,Chandler,,,
" You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!,,,Chandler,,,
 I think.... I think I can see your scalp.,,,Chandler,,,
 What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.",,,Chandler,,,
 Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.,,,Chandler,,,
" You go back to work tomorrow night, right?",,,Chandler,,,
" So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?",,,Chandler,,,
 What are you singing?,,,Chandler,,,
" It's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from ""Apocalypse Now""... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!",,,Chandler,,,
 Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.,,,Chandler,,,
" Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hit yourself in the tooth?,,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?",,,Chandler,,,
 Really? What happened?,,,Chandler,,,
 You can't move at all?,,,Chandler,,,
" If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?",,,Chandler,,,
 (trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little frayed.,,,Chandler,,,
" Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?",,,Chandler,,,
 I think you know.,,,Chandler,,,
 This is what I want to do.,,,Chandler,,,
" (Picks up the ""Miss Congeniality"" DVD) She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.",,,Chandler,,,
 There's a hair in my coffee.,,,Chandler,,,
" You know, it's funny. Every time you say ""triplets,"" I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.",,,Chandler,,,
" So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?",,,Chandler,,,
" I mean, you have a lovely home.",,,Chandler,,,
 That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?,,,Chandler,,,
" You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, you must be Owen.",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.",,,Chandler,,,
 You know how to use a compass?,,,Chandler,,,
 You do? That's fantastic!,,,Chandler,,,
" I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 I got nothing.,,,Chandler,,,
 Where are Bill and Colleen?,,,Chandler,,,
 We have to leave!!,,,Chandler,,,
" I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.",,,Chandler,,,
 But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?,,,Chandler,,,
 See? Intuitive!,,,Chandler,,,
 Which technically now you should give back!,,,Chandler,,,
" I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. ""Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real.""",,,Chandler,,,
" Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. (Runs off.),,,Chandler,,,
" So, you and Rachel tonight, uh?",,,Chandler,,,
 Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?,,,Chandler,,,
 What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.,,,Chandler,,,
 How can you be so confident?,,,Chandler,,,
 Really? Like you have a routine?,,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
 You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way),,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. (They look at each other, both embarassed)",,,Chandler,,,
 ...and beer!!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!,,,Chandler,,,
 She went on one of those spray-on tan places.,,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica) Why...why?,,,Chandler,,,
" Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Pheebs!,,,Chandler,,,
 Who's Amanda?,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you trying to do a British accent?,,,Chandler,,,
" Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?",,,Chandler,,,
" No, had it done to me though. Feels good !",,,Chandler,,,
 Hello? Is someone on the line?,,,Chandler,,,
" Hang on, she’s right here. (he enters the living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for ya.",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Amanda) I get pedicures!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hold on! There is something different.,,,Chandler,,,
 Was that place... The Sun?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!,,,Chandler,,,
 How was your date with Joey?,,,Chandler,,,
 You didn't like that?,,,Chandler,,,
 (without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't know! (Monica just smiles),,,Chandler,,,
" If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, aren't you a treat.",,,Chandler,,,
" That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!",,,Chandler,,,
" Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...",,,Chandler,,,
" Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.",,,Chandler,,,
" I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)",,,Chandler,,,
" Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.",,,Chandler,,,
" I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, I just had to get a picture of this.",,,Chandler,,,
 I see you later!,,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.",,,Chandler,,,
 Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!,,,Chandler,,,
 There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...,,,Chandler,,,
" Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.",,,Chandler,,,
" I know, what are we gonna do?",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!,,,Chandler,,,
 To be fair this one does have nuts.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?,,,Chandler,,,
" We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)",,,Chandler,,,
 Was that Emma? Is she up?,,,Chandler,,,
 I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!,,,Chandler,,,
 To the bathroom!,,,Chandler,,,
 (Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and Joey come out looking shocked),,,Chandler,,,
" You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm begging you stop.,,,Chandler,,,
 (Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!,,,Chandler,,,
 Thats a bear.,,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!",,,Chandler,,,
 I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?,,,Chandler,,,
 They left.,,,Chandler,,,
" I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?",,,Chandler,,,
" Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.",,,Chandler,,,
 Ooh! That's my girl!,,,Chandler,,,
 Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?,,,Chandler,,,
 Me too...,,,Chandler,,,
 There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?,,,Chandler,,,
 I was kidding.,,,Chandler,,,
" No, not yet.",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.",,,Chandler,,,
" Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)",,,Chandler,,,
" Let's do it, come on!",,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks!,,,Chandler,,,
" Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.",,,Chandler,,,
 So excited about your letter!,,,Chandler,,,
 So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?,,,Chandler,,,
 That's where people make number two!!,,,Chandler,,,
 (reading) I don’t... uh... understand.,,,Chandler,,,
 On every word?,,,Chandler,,,
 And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?,,,Chandler,,,
" You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.",,,Chandler,,,
 I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.,,,Chandler,,,
 Word!,,,Chandler,,,
 She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a guy..?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!",,,Chandler,,,
 Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?,,,Chandler,,,
 Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?,,,Chandler,,,
" It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)",,,Chandler,,,
" (on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).",,,Chandler,,,
 (Still looks confused) They loved it.,,,Chandler,,,
 They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.,,,Chandler,,,
" She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.",,,Chandler,,,
 That sounds like fun.,,,Chandler,,,
 I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but I am wrong!,,,Chandler,,,
 Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.",,,Chandler,,,
 (he enters) Hey honey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Is Monica not here?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! (silence) Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.",,,Chandler,,,
" First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.",,,Chandler,,,
 Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey you guys.,,,Chandler,,,
" Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.",,,Chandler,,,
 Joe...,,,Chandler,,,
 Fine!,,,Chandler,,,
" Work, Joe!",,,Chandler,,,
" He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!",,,Chandler,,,
" That's good! I liked it, they didn't. (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake, go to work! (Joey runs away).",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Joe!,,,Chandler,,,
 Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.,,,Chandler,,,
 (Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man.,,,Chandler,,,
" (sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey continues to look at him suspiciously) But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!",,,Chandler,,,
 (looks surprised) What!? Of course I did!,,,Chandler,,,
" I'm not lying to you, I watched it!",,,Chandler,,,
 I watched it!,,,Chandler,,,
 (now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did!,,,Chandler,,,
" (following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape. (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)",,,Chandler,,,
"(In a sarcastic ""of course not""!-tone) No!",,,Chandler,,,
 I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!,,,Chandler,,,
 What did I just say?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...",,,Chandler,,,
 Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?,,,Chandler,,,
 He really is a chameleon.,,,Chandler,,,
" Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.",,,Chandler,,,
 I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?,,,Chandler,,,
 Lying is wrong!,,,Chandler,,,
 I'm a pretty little girl.,,,Chandler,,,
" That's funny, we were doing the same thing!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.",,,Chandler,,,
" It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
 Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.,,,Chandler,,,
 You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!,,,Chandler,,,
 Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.,,,Chandler,,,
 (pointing at himself) Little people?,,,Chandler,,,
 What...? NO!,,,Chandler,,,
" (he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!",,,Chandler,,,
" I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.",,,Chandler,,,
" Ok, ok, here we go.",,,Chandler,,,
 Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door and both are smiling exaggeratedly),,,Chandler,,,
 But you already gave all your money to charity!,,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t think you can do that!,,,Chandler,,,
" That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.",,,Chandler,,,
" But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
 Of course it was!,,,Chandler,,,
 RAT b*st*rd!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with",,,Chandler,,,
 (Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey bangs on",,,Chandler,,,
" WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.,,,Chandler,,,
 (nervous smile) You can't make this stuff up!,,,Chandler,,,
 What the hell are you doing?,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, we're not.",,,Chandler,,,
 We don't have a code word.,,,Chandler,,,
 Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously),,,Chandler,,,
 (escorting Joey to the door) You have to get out of here. You slept with,,,Chandler,,,
 Ok!,,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat)",,,Chandler,,,
 I can explain... Joey...,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, that's really ok.",,,Chandler,,,
 Wrong number?,,,Chandler,,,
 That's great!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.",,,Chandler,,,
" No, no! We made this decision together.",,,Chandler,,,
 Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!,,,Chandler,,,
 We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?,,,Chandler,,,
 Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?,,,Chandler,,,
" You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!",,,Chandler,,,
 Somebody is gonna pick us.,,,Chandler,,,
" I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. (pause) What, he's my favourite author!",,,Chandler,,,
" (after a long pause) ""The Firm""?",,,Chandler,,,
" You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.",,,Chandler,,,
" I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing ""high profile"".",,,Chandler,,,
 Tell me more.,,,Chandler,,,
 You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh my God!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hmm, the game's at one.",,,Chandler,,,
" Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.",,,Chandler,,,
" You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!",,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (pause) And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!,,,Chandler,,,
 I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!,,,Chandler,,,
 (peeping) They're out there!,,,Chandler,,,
" (peeping) Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says ""Rangers"" on it. They went to the game!",,,Chandler,,,
 (looking through the peephole again) Ross' shirt is torn.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to Monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?",,,Chandler,,,
 (relieved) Oh thank God!,,,Chandler,,,
" (looking through the peephole) That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.",,,Chandler,,,
" Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. (Monica looks at Chandler)",,,Chandler,,,
 HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!,,,Chandler,,,
 Please let me stay on this side of the door.,,,Chandler,,,
 The cranberries...?,,,Chandler,,,
" He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him! (They both look away)",,,Chandler,,,
 The floating heads do make a good point.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.",,,Chandler,,,
 That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.,,,Chandler,,,
 A little late for that.,,,Chandler,,,
" Uhm, we've got turkey grease.",,,Chandler,,,
 Can you ever feel your ears?,,,Chandler,,,
" (sarcastically) Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!",,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!",,,Chandler,,,
" Come on guys, PUSH!",,,Chandler,,,
 My cranberries!,,,Chandler,,,
 Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!,,,Chandler,,,
 (to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!,,,Chandler,,,
 What's going on?,,,Chandler,,,
 And?,,,Chandler,,,
 Are you serious? (they hug),,,Chandler,,,
 That is the exact same thing.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hi!,,,Chandler,,,
" We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.",,,Chandler,,,
 And so incorrect!,,,Chandler,,,
" Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..",,,Chandler,,,
 I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.,,,Chandler,,,
 So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yes, but...",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: ""Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?""",,,Chandler,,,
 You're gonna be great.,,,Chandler,,,
 Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.,,,Chandler,,,
 Ok.,,,Chandler,,,
 That's what our friends call us.,,,Chandler,,,
 (astonished) I don't think that's exactly...,,,Chandler,,,
" So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?",,,Chandler,,,
 Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, wow.",,,Chandler,,,
 No-ot for me it doesn’t.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?",,,Chandler,,,
 You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I did.",,,Chandler,,,
 We are NOT signing those papers.,,,Chandler,,,
 It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.,,,Chandler,,,
 You have gotta stop!,,,Chandler,,,
 She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.,,,Chandler,,,
" Your Veal Chop is $34,95!",,,Chandler,,,
 But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?,,,Chandler,,,
 I know..,,,Chandler,,,
" oh, honey..",,,Chandler,,,
" Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. ",,,Chandler,,,
" So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.",,,Chandler,,,
 You're Jewish.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.,,,Chandler,,,
 I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.",,,Chandler,,,
 Erica wait!,,,Chandler,,,
 You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.,,,Chandler,,,
" Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.",,,Chandler,,,
" But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?",,,Chandler,,,
 You still want that baby?,,,Chandler,,,
" (looking at her) Seriously, answer faster!",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Phoebe) It's like a giant hug.,,,Chandler,,,
 (picking up the phone) Hello.,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.",,,Chandler,,,
 Those are all really old!,,,Chandler,,,
 Hi!,,,Chandler,,,
 I was in the car with Nancy all day.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!",,,Chandler,,,
 It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.,,,Chandler,,,
 And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) What were the things you said?,,,Chandler,,,
 And the fireplace in the bedroom.,,,Chandler,,,
 This is bringing out a lovely color in you!,,,Chandler,,,
 I don’t know. What do you think?,,,Chandler,,,
 I do too.,,,Chandler,,,
 I know.,,,Chandler,,,
" I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.",,,Chandler,,,
" We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.",,,Chandler,,,
 I know. Gooooood luck with it.,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?",,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.,,,Chandler,,,
 ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.,,,Chandler,,,
" Actually, we already found a house we love.",,,Chandler,,,
" Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?",,,Chandler,,,
 I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.,,,Chandler,,,
" (goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)",,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!",,,Chandler,,,
" If you win, we give up the birds.",,,Chandler,,,
" But if we win, we get your apartment.",,,Chandler,,,
 Dangerous Liaisons.,,,Chandler,,,
 Fancy.,,,Chandler,,,
 Fancy guest.,,,Chandler,,,
 Thanks man.,,,Chandler,,,
 Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!,,,Chandler,,,
" (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.",,,Chandler,,,
" Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.",,,Chandler,,,
 (entering) Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 I know. (He kisses her.),,,Chandler,,,
 No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.),,,Chandler,,,
 Sure!,,,Chandler,,,
" Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.",,,Chandler,,,
" Here, here!",,,Chandler,,,
" Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.",,,Chandler,,,
" (to Nancy) Okay, thanks... (to Monica) They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.",,,Chandler,,,
 I know.,,,Chandler,,,
" That's okay, we understand.",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.",,,Chandler,,,
 We got the house.,,,Chandler,,,
 I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.,,,Chandler,,,
 We're getting the house. (they hug) We're getting the house.,,,Chandler,,,
 We're growing up.,,,Chandler,,,
 So who's gonna tell them?,,,Chandler,,,
 Not it! Damn it!,,,Chandler,,,
 You'll see.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.",,,Chandler,,,
 What did I marry into?,,,Chandler,,,
 You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!,,,Chandler,,,
 (to Monica) I'm leaving you.,,,Chandler,,,
 Who?,,,Chandler,,,
 (looking around) Did I go to this school?,,,Chandler,,,
" (looks over at her) Sure, nice.",,,Chandler,,,
" You're right, by saying ""nice"" I'm virtually licking her.",,,Chandler,,,
 Are you asking permission to break the pact?,,,Chandler,,,
" Awesome, the name really stands out.",,,Chandler,,,
" Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" You know, our band is playing on Friday.",,,Chandler,,,
 Fresh!,,,Chandler,,,
 Mint!,,,Chandler,,,
" I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.",,,Chandler,,,
" I said it first, bro.",,,Chandler,,,
" (angrily) Look, if you did...",,,Chandler,,,
 Totally. I had s*x in High school...,,,Chandler,,,
" All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.",,,Chandler,,,
" All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.",,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.",,,Chandler,,,
 Your hands are shaking.,,,Chandler,,,
 (to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them). That didn't make us sound gay at all!,,,Chandler,,,
" Ross, that was 16 years ago!",,,Chandler,,,
" I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (Ross just stares at him) All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh really?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh really!?,,,Chandler,,,
 ADRIENNE TURNER!! (A girl behind them turns around),,,Chandler,,,
" Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.",,,Chandler,,,
 Really?,,,Chandler,,,
 Aren't you...?,,,Chandler,,,
 (smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hi Monica.,,,Chandler,,,
 O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes off to find Ross.),,,Chandler,,,
" Well, I did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) That's when I wrote the song: ""Betrayal In The Common Room"".",,,Chandler,,,
 Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong time ago.,,,Chandler,,,
 (smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..,,,Chandler,,,
" (sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?",,,Chandler,,,
 Not her!,,,Chandler,,,
 Soo... you girls having fun?,,,Chandler,,,
 Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.,,,Chandler,,,
" Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.",,,Chandler,,,
 So where are you applying to?,,,Chandler,,,
 I'm in college and I'm in a band.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why?,,,Chandler,,,
 You kissed her that night too?,,,Chandler,,,
" Seriously, where did this happen?",,,Chandler,,,
 Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?,,,Chandler,,,
 I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.,,,Chandler,,,
" Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?",,,Chandler,,,
 What did I marry into?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,,,Chandler,,,
" You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.",,,Chandler,,,
 No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.,,,Chandler,,,
 (to Rachel) You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.,,,Chandler,,,
 Heh.,,,Chandler,,,
 This is like figure skating team all over again. (Phoebe and Ross glare at him astonished) I mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) I mean- I mean the balance beam. (to Ross) Help me!,,,Chandler,,,
 Thank you.,,,Chandler,,,
" I know, I hate being left out of things.",,,Chandler,,,
 Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.,,,Chandler,,,
 What happened?,,,Chandler,,,
 (standing up too) M-Me-me-me!,,,Chandler,,,
" Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!",,,Chandler,,,
 You are going downer!,,,Chandler,,,
" (almost crying) I wouldn't know, I didn't make it! (they hug)",,,Chandler,,,
 Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.,,,Chandler,,,
 Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!",,,Chandler,,,
" Let me tell you why you need to pick me. (Goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. Rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.",,,Chandler,,,
" (Getting up and raising his fist in victory) Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make ""groom"" for Chandler.",,,Chandler,,,
 How's it going?,,,Chandler,,,
 (smiling to himself too) That's what I was doing too.,,,Chandler,,,
 You too.,,,Chandler,,,
 Me too.,,,Chandler,,,
 I'm not supposed to tell you.,,,Chandler,,,
 You told us both we could be in the wedding? (they both stare at Rachel),,,Chandler,,,
" Rach, Rach, knock knock.",,,Chandler,,,
 I'll tell you at the wedding.,,,Chandler,,,
" So technically, would this person be in the wedding?",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm not scared. (moves towards Mike and Chappy) I'll just take little Chappy and... (he backs out) HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.,,,Chandler,,,
 (quickly) I'll do it.,,,Chandler,,,
" (to Ross) Na ha ha... (to Chappy) Ne he he... (Ross moves Chappy to Chandler, who quickly backs away) Ah ah...",,,Chandler,,,
 (to Monica) Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yeah! (Monica walks outside),,,Chandler,,,
 Ready?,,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,,,
 Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?,,,Chandler,,,
 You look beautiful.,,,Chandler,,,
 That really was an incredible wedding.,,,Chandler,,,
" I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized s*x anyone's ever had.",,,Chandler,,,
 I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.,,,Chandler,,,
" So, where's Mike?",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Why are you wearing my apron?,,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as ""my wife"" and ""the woman who's carrying my child""? (she's not amused) No? Divorce?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes ""Mooooo""!",,,Chandler,,,
 I'm so sorry...,,,Chandler,,,
" Monica. Calm, self.",,,Chandler,,,
 Why would you say that?,,,Chandler,,,
 Great! (to Monica) This baby'd better to be really good.,,,Chandler,,,
" (enters the room wearing an ""I love New York"" t-shirt, a ""Statue of Liberty"" hat and carrying bags) New York is awesome!",,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?",,,Chandler,,,
 That's great.,,,Chandler,,,
" So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?",,,Chandler,,,
 I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.,,,Chandler,,,
 Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! (He turns the light on),,,Chandler,,,
" Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.",,,Chandler,,,
 I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.,,,Chandler,,,
" I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?",,,Chandler,,,
" Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says ""mom"" on his shovel-wielding arm!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey! How was lunch?,,,Chandler,,,
" (struggling) Oh, really?",,,Chandler,,,
" O-okay. (steps closer to Monica and speaks softly) So, is she gonna take the test?",,,Chandler,,,
" Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?",,,Chandler,,,
 How do you know?,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?,,,Chandler,,,
 (nods in appreciation) Shovely Joe!,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.",,,Chandler,,,
" You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it. (she shrugs)",,,Chandler,,,
 A dinosaur died a million years ago?,,,Chandler,,,
 YOU NEVER DID IT!,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.",,,Chandler,,,
 Mrs Hannigan?,,,Chandler,,,
 Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.",,,Chandler,,,
 Damn it.,,,Chandler,,,
 That's what we were gonna name the baby.,,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, how'd the interview go?",,,Chandler,,,
" You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.",,,Chandler,,,
 That is a bad interview.,,,Chandler,,,
 Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!,,,Chandler,,,
 To Ross!,,,Chandler,,,
" And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.",,,Chandler,,,
 What?,,,Chandler,,,
" When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?",,,Chandler,,,
" Man, those two dogs are going at it!",,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,,,
 Really? What changed your mind?,,,Chandler,,,
" Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.",,,Chandler,,,
 Ha! I'm just messing with you.,,,Chandler,,,
 You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?,,,Chandler,,,
 It's seven years ago. (he looks surprised) My time machine works!,,,Chandler,,,
 Excuse me?,,,Chandler,,,
" For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.",,,Chandler,,,
 How did the job stuff go?,,,Chandler,,,
 That's great!,,,Chandler,,,
 How did the job stuff go?,,,Chandler,,,
 Or facing a bitch of a commute.,,,Chandler,,,
 My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (Monica looks at him and can't really place what he just said),,,Chandler,,,
" Well, it makes me feel sad, but...",,,Chandler,,,
 I see.,,,Chandler,,,
 Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?,,,Chandler,,,
" We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.",,,Chandler,,,
 What do you think Pheebs?,,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah.,,,Chandler,,,
 You're kidding!,,,Chandler,,,
 Oh yeah?,,,Chandler,,,
 I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.,,,Chandler,,,
" Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.",,,Chandler,,,
" It feels like we’re cheating on our house. And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won’t do?",,,Chandler,,,
 And yet I never run into Beyonce!,,,Chandler,,,
" (at Janice's punching) Don't, don't! (looks disgusted)",,,Chandler,,,
 (To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why!?,,,Chandler,,,
 This can not be happening!,,,Chandler,,,
" The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.",,,Chandler,,,
" That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?",,,Chandler,,,
" Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.",,,Chandler,,,
" Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and (apes Janice's voice) ""Oh My God""!",,,Chandler,,,
" (looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she's right) Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly outside) Oh, that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)",,,Chandler,,,
 The Hitlers will be so disappointed.,,,Chandler,,,
 Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.,,,Chandler,,,
 Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.,,,Chandler,,,
 I never stopped loving you.,,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.",,,Chandler,,,
" Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.",,,Chandler,,,
 (stunned) Obviously.,,,Chandler,,,
 Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.,,,Chandler,,,
 I understand.,,,Chandler,,,
 (speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now.,,,Chandler,,,
 That's nice.,Joey,,Chandler,,,
" Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.",,,Chandler,,,
 I was not ready for this today!,,,Chandler,,,
 Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.,,,Chandler,,,
 Listen...this is really nice. Do you... (sees his chequebook) Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?,,,Chandler,,,
" We have to get out of here, baby!",,,Chandler,,,
 Sure.,,,Chandler,,,
 What am I gonna do now?,,,Chandler,,,
 No no no!,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,Chandler,,,
" He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.",Joey,,Chandler,,,
 (running after bus) Ben! Ben! Ben! ,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?,Joey,,Chandler,,,
" Woah, hey, yo. [Rachel and Ross move]",Joey,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, yo. [they move from out of in front of the TV]",Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,Chandler,,,
" Hey, woah, hey, woah.",Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Okay. (they don't move),Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Sorry Phoebe.,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Yeah! Why don’t you stick around. You can sit right there.,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!!,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Whoa!!!,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 YEAH!!! YES!!!,Joey,,Chandler,,,

 Surprise!!,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Ohhh.,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Nice!,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,Chandler,Monica,,
 All right.,,,Chandler,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,Chandler,Monica,,
 What?!,,,Chandler,Monica,,
 No!,,,,,,
" ‘I’ll be a fool for you. I’m sure, you know I",,,Chandler,,Phoebe,

" Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.",,,,Monica,,
"  Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! (A shell explodes outside next to the tent and when the smoke clears, Phoebe still has her arm.) Whew! (Her arm falls off and starts pumping out blood.) This is getting ridiculous uh!",,,,,Phoebe,
" C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!",Joey,,,,,
 Instead of...?,Joey,,,,,
 Never had that dream.,Joey,,,,,
" This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.",Joey,,,,,
 And you never knew she was a lesbian...,Joey,,,,,
" Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?",Joey,,,,,
" Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!",Joey,,,,,
 I say push her down the stairs.,Joey,,,,,
" (SITTING BESIDE HER) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.",Joey,,,,,
" What, like there's a rule or something?",Joey,,,,,
 Who's Paul?,Joey,,,,,
 Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?",Joey,,,,,
 What's this?,Joey,,,,,
 Done with the bookcase!,Joey,,,,,
" Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?",Joey,,,,,
 You got screwed.,Joey,,,,,
" What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavour of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavours out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!",Joey,,,,,
" Congratulations. And while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelette or something... (JOEY AND CHANDLER TASTE THE COFFEE, GRIMACE, AND POUR IT INTO A PLANT POT) Although actually I'm really not that hungry...",Joey,,,,,
" Morning, Paul.",Joey,,,,,
 That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I'm an actor.",Joey,,,,,
 I doubt it. Mostly regional work.,Joey,,,,,
 I will not take this abuse. (WALKS TO DOOR AND OPENS IT TO LEAVE),Joey,,,,,
 (PERCHED ON THE SIDE OF THE SOFA)Of course it was a line!,Joey,,,,,
 (BURSTS OUT LAUGHING AGAIN) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!,Joey,,,,,
 I can't believe what I'm hearing here.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?",Joey,,,,,
 (PAUSE)....Are we still talking about s*x?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.",Joey,,,,,
" Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?",Joey,,,,,
" .....Well, this is still ruined, right?",Joey,,,,,
" Your folks are really that bad, huh?",Joey,,,,,
 What are we supposed to be seeing here?,Joey,,,,,
" Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. Cushions the blow.,Joey,,,,,
" ""Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.""",Joey,,,,,
 Thanks! Let's keep going.,Joey,,,,,
" ""I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.""",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 Whoah!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.",Joey,,,,,
 Y'miss it?,Joey,,,,,
 That's ridiculous!,Joey,,,,,
" Y'okay, Phoebe?",Joey,,,,,
 What are you talking about? Keep it!,Joey,,,,,
 So when do we get to meet the guy?,Joey,,,,,
" Let it go, Ross. ",Joey,,,,,
" You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!",Joey,,,,,
 (SHOUTS TO CHANDLER) Chandler! He's here!,Joey,,,,,
 Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.,Joey,,,,,
 Alan.,Joey,,,,,
 ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, (IMITATING ROSS) ""you do, do you""?",Joey,,,,,
 Do you have any respect for your body?,Joey,,,,,
 (DRAGGED IN BY MONICA. HE HAS JUST COME OUT OF THE SHOWER) What's going on?,Joey,,,,,
 Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, God! (HURRIEDLY CLOSES HIS KNEES) ",Joey,,,,,
 So that's it? It's over? Just like that?,Joey,,,,,
 Okay!,Joey,,,,,
 Probably kill myself!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!",Joey,,,,,
" You are? Ross, I'm sorry..",Joey,,,,,
" ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.",Joey,,,,,
" (TO ROSS) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.",Joey,,,,,
" We love you, man. (KISSES HIM)",Joey,,,,,
 So?,Joey,,,,,
 What's wrong with the twentieth?,Joey,,,,,
" The hell with hockey, let's all do that!",Joey,,,,,
" C'mon, Ross!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.",Joey,,,,,
" Leech spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass! (KICKS IT TO ROSS, BUT ROSS IS STARING INTO A SHOP WINDOW)",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 -Peaches?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! (THEY TURN TO STARE AT HIM) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.",Joey,,,,,
" C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, how long do you think it'll be?",Joey,,,,,
" He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 With Carol?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh.,Joey,,,,,
" Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! ",Joey,,,,,
 Man. Can you believe he's only had s*x with one woman?,Joey,,,,,
 Really?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, ah- the kid has it.",Joey,,,,,
" Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.",Joey,,,,,
" No plans, huh?",Joey,,,,,
" Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.",Joey,,,,,
" My god, Angela.",Joey,,,,,
" No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. [he walks over to her] Hey, Angela.",Joey,,,,,
 You look good.,Joey,,,,,
 You don't say.,Joey,,,,,
 Bob? Who the hell's Bob?,Joey,,,,,
" Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?",Joey,,,,,
" You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.",Joey,,,,,
" Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.",Joey,,,,,
" Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is--",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.",Joey,,,,,
" [proud] I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?",Joey,,,,,
 Yep.,Joey,,,,,
 Which what?,Joey,,,,,
" No, but he's--",Joey,,,,,
 Oh my god.,Joey,,,,,
 I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.,Joey,,,,,
" So, you and Angela, huh?",Joey,,,,,
" You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" Come on, they're close.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, who's to say what's true? I mean--",Joey,,,,,
" All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.",Joey,,,,,
 Ow!,Joey,,,,,
" Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.",Joey,,,,,
 Excellent.,Joey,,,,,
" Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.",Joey,,,,,
 Whadja think?,Joey,,,,,
" C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.",Joey,,,,,
" The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!",Joey,,,,,
 Who's Rick?,Joey,,,,,
 I couldn't do it.,Joey,,,,,
" When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (TO ALL) That was my agent. (TOSSES AND CATCHES PHONE) My agent has just gotten me a job- in the new Al Pacino movie!",Joey,,,,,
 Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! 'I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!',Joey,,,,,
" 'Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!'",Joey,,,,,
 ...I'm his (MUMBLES),Joey,,,,,
" ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.",Joey,,,,,
" C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!",Joey,,,,,
 Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.,Joey,,,,,
 Whaddya think? Today's the big day!,Joey,,,,,
 Thank you! (GOES OFF TO THE BATHROOM),Joey,,,,,
" Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.",Joey,,,,,
 Me?,Joey,,,,,
 Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (TAKES IT OFF) And the robe is lost.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I'm- I'm showering.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.",Joey,,,,,
 I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...,Joey,,,,,
 Nope.,Joey,,,,,
 I got fired.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and-",Joey,,,,,
 My mom will.,Joey,,,,,
" Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!",Joey,,,,,
" Hard to tell, I was naked.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah? That's so nice! (THEY HUG),Joey,,,,,
 Hi everyone.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.",Joey,,,,,
 What's up man?,Joey,,,,,
" [to everyone] Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! [on phone] Chandler, listen. [says something intentionally garbled]",Joey,,,,,
 OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.,Joey,,,,,
 We have a winner!,Joey,,,,,
 It's never gonna happen.,Joey,,,,,
 You and Rachel.,Joey,,,,,
" Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.",Joey,,,,,
" Ross, you're mayor of the zone.",Joey,,,,,
" Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' [Rachel comes into the room behind them]",Joey,,,,,
 Are you going to do it?,Joey,,,,,
 Do you want any help?,Joey,,,,,
" Good luck, man.",Joey,,,,,
 OK. [Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to Rachel],Joey,,,,,
" Hey, where are you going?",Joey,,,,,
 You can't go out there.,Joey,,,,,
 Because of... the reason.,Joey,,,,,
" I, um, can't tell you.",Joey,,,,,
" OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.",Joey,,,,,
 He's planning your birthday party.,Joey,,,,,
 [as Phoebe enters] You'd better act surprised.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.",Joey,,,,,
" Sorry, that was wax.",Joey,,,,,
 [does a maniacal laugh] Bwah-hah-hah!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.",Joey,,,,,
 Not me.,Joey,,,,,
 Twice?,Joey,,,,,
 You guys okay?,Joey,,,,,
" Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! [Realises his tactlessness] ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?",Joey,,,,,
 [Entering with Chandler] Morning. We ready to go?,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. [He has a pocket TV]",Joey,,,,,
" No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.",Joey,,,,,
" [Hides the TV, but he still has an earphone] Just a, uh... hearing disability.",Joey,,,,,
 Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.,Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, look look look look look! I got Monica naked!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hey.",Joey,,,,,
" Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.",Joey,,,,,
 You know those posters for the city free clinic?,Joey,,,,,
" No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers)",Joey,,,,,
 Thanks.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 (to Monica) We did?,Joey,,,,,
" Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. (pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis?",Joey,,,,,
 I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.,Joey,,,,,
" I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.",Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?",Joey,,,,,
" Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?",Joey,,,,,
 What's wrong?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh. What?,Joey,,,,,
" Wait, wait, wait!",Joey,,,,,
 So I guess you all saw it.,Joey,,,,,
 Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.,Joey,,,,,
" Chandler, will you just come in already?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.",Joey,,,,,
" But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.",Joey,,,,,
 The balloon?,Joey,,,,,
" Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.",Joey,,,,,
 That tone will not make me go any faster.,Joey,,,,,
 That one will.,Joey,,,,,
" Nope, not that one.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.",Joey,,,,,
 You call that delicious?,Joey,,,,,
 I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I will.",Joey,,,,,
 The bigger half.,Joey,,,,,
" Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.",Joey,,,,,
" I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.",Joey,,,,,
" Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!",Joey,,,,,
" Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.",Joey,,,,,
" Nice shoes, huh? [He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle]",Joey,,,,,
 You know more than one Fun Bobby?,Joey,,,,,
" Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, four.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?",Joey,,,,,
" Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! [She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger girl]...You brought your kids.",Joey,,,,,
" Wow, that's, uh, dirty.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, kids...",Joey,,,,,
 [Approaching] Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?,Joey,,,,,
" There y'go, kids.",Joey,,,,,
 You seen Sandy?,Joey,,,,,
 Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.,Joey,,,,,
" Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.",Joey,,,,,
 Alrightalrightalright. [Kisses him. Ross takes a photo] There.,Joey,,,,,
 I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.,Joey,,,,,
" C'mon, she's your mom!",Joey,,,,,
 Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Right. No big deal.,Joey,,,,,
 In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!,Joey,,,,,
" You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.",Joey,,,,,
" Ross, how could you let this happen?",Joey,,,,,
 You don't think my mom's sexy?,Joey,,,,,
" I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?",Joey,,,,,
 He forgot to leave his grip size!,Joey,,,,,
 So are you gonna tell him?,Joey,,,,,
" How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.",Joey,,,,,
 Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!,Joey,,,,,
" Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.",Joey,,,,,
" Me neither, y'know what-",Joey,,,,,
 What are you mad at me for?!,Joey,,,,,
" (Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) See what happens when you break the code?",Joey,,,,,
 Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door),Joey,,,,,
" (To Ross, on the couch) Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.",Joey,,,,,
" C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.",Joey,,,,,
 (Laughing) Mother-Kisser... (Sees Ross's look) I'll shut up.,Joey,,,,,
" Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.",Joey,,,,,
" No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?""",Joey,,,,,
" Then she came back with ""The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?""",Joey,,,,,
 That makes more sense.,Joey,,,,,
" I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to the door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)",Joey,,,,,
" Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!",Joey,,,,,
 You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.,Joey,,,,,
" Ross, did you really read all these baby books?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? (measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) This is your baby. (in baby-like voice) Hi Daddy!",Joey,,,,,
 (in baby-like voice) How come you don't live with Mommy? (pause; shows Ross less than amused) How come Mommy lives with that other lady? (pause; Ross still looks less than amused; Joey smiling) What's a lesbian? (playfully hits Ross),Joey,,,,,
" I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...",Joey,,,,,
 Need a new table.,Joey,,,,,
 That's the rule.,Joey,,,,,
 How'd you get to that?,Joey,,,,,
 You knew about that?,Joey,,,,,
" Ok, ok, How about if we split it?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah,Joey,,,,,
 Why not?,Joey,,,,,
" Why, are you moving out?",Joey,,,,,
 You'd tell me if you were moving out right,Joey,,,,,
" Aw, I know all about Kip!",Joey,,,,,
" Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?",Joey,,,,,
 So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up and waves arms frantically in protest),Joey,,,,,
 Or an uncle...,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.",Joey,,,,,
" Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!",Joey,,,,,
 Feminist issue. That's where I went!,Joey,,,,,
" Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? (points to a table)",Joey,,,,,
" So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"" Of course!",Joey,,,,,
" I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat something.""",Joey,,,,,
" All right, how about the ladybugs?",Joey,,,,,
" Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!",Joey,,,,,
" Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!",Joey,,,,,
" No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.",Joey,,,,,
" Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!",Joey,,,,,
 Wha-,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!",Joey,,,,,
 Oh yeah!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?",Joey,,,,,
" Dad, dad. [Shakes his head]",Joey,,,,,
" [Snatches the phone] Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? [To his dad] Did you know this isn't Ma?",Joey,,,,,
 Sure. So how long you been... [Goes back to chopping],Joey,,,,,
 Since then?!,Joey,,,,,
 ...I d'know.,Joey,,,,,
 You're one to talk. [Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan],Joey,,,,,
 Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.,Joey,,,,,
" It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the CIA. [Considers] That'd be cool.... This blows!",Joey,,,,,
 What's the matter with Rog?,Joey,,,,,
" Night, you guys.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?",Joey,,,,,
 I'm Joey Tribbiani.,Joey,,,,,
" Dad, Ronni's here.",Joey,,,,,
 Whoah-ho.,Joey,,,,,
 No you won't.,Joey,,,,,
 If you go to a hotel you'll be.. doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.,Joey,,,,,
" That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.",Joey,,,,,
" Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni- uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, either you break it off with Ronni-",Joey,,,,,
 Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!,Joey,,,,,
 I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!,Joey,,,,,
 Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear. ,Joey,,,,,
" I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...",Joey,,,,,
" Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...",Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
 You really think so?,Joey,,,,,
" Thanks, Chandler. [Snuggles up to him]",Joey,,,,,
 [Runs out in a towel] What's the matter with you?!,Joey,,,,,
 Ma! What're you doing here?,Joey,,,,,
 Oww! Big ring!,Joey,,,,,
" Hold on, you-you knew?",Joey,,,,,
" So then- how could you- I mean, how could you?!-",Joey,,,,,
" Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?",Joey,,,,,
 I'm...happy...for you?,Joey,,,,,
" Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.,Joey,,,,,
 With this ring? No contest.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I guess. It's just- parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.",Joey,,,,,
" Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. [He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by Monica in a towel]",Joey,,,,,
 Sorry. Wrong boobies.,Joey,,,,,
" I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.",Joey,,,,,
 You're in!,Joey,,,,,
" Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, ""Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg.""",Joey,,,,,
 Think it'll work?,Joey,,,,,
" Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.",Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.",Joey,,,,,
" Pathetic mess? I know, but--come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! [Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and eats it.] Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.",Joey,,,,,
 [Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife] How do I look?,Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down. CHANDLER: Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!",Joey,,,,,
" [at the urinal] Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.",Joey,,,,,
" Good for you. [jumps suddenly] Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?",Joey,,,,,
 [to Lorraine] We can't do that.,Joey,,,,,
" Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, we might be leaving now.",Joey,,,,,
" She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.",Joey,,,,,
" You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.",Joey,,,,,
" I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.",Joey,,,,,
 [in disbelief] Whoa.,Joey,,,,,
 I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.,Joey,,,,,
" [to Chandler] If you don't do it, I will.",Joey,,,,,
 So what're you going to do?,Joey,,,,,
" How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.",Joey,,,,,
" [aside to Ross] So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... [gestures with hands, back and forth] huh-huh?",Joey,,,,,
" I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.",Joey,,,,,
 [tasting] Mmmm. Good.,Joey,,,,,
 It's creamier.,Joey,,,,,
" I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?",Joey,,,,,
 Uh-oh.,Joey,,,,,
 [in disbelief] Vulva?,Joey,,,,,
 [sarcastic] Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??,Joey,,,,,
 What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.,Joey,,,,,
 Why not? Come on! Close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.,Joey,,,,,
 ....yeah... what else?,Joey,,,,,
" [walks to catch up to him] Alright, look, I'll start, OK?",Joey,,,,,
" Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! [in a low voice] Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.",Joey,,,,,
" Alright, now you say something.",Joey,,,,,
" Come on! You like this woman, right?",Joey,,,,,
" You want to see her again, right?",Joey,,,,,
" Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!",Joey,,,,,
" [turning around] Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.",Joey,,,,,
 There you go! Keep going. Keep going!,Joey,,,,,
 Say it... say it!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.",Joey,,,,,
" And again, and again, and again... [phone rings, he answers] Hello? [hands phone to Chandler] And again.",Joey,,,,,
 What a tool!,Joey,,,,,
" [to Ross] So, er... how did it go with Celia?",Joey,,,,,
" All right, Ross!",Joey,,,,,
 Whoa! And the... [gestures with hands] huh-huh?,Joey,,,,,
 You cuddled.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, where the hell is he?",Joey,,,,,
" There's the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?",Joey,,,,,
" No, no how come are you working here?",Joey,,,,,
 I'm sayin' I see a difference.,Joey,,,,,
 I don't care. Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's--hot!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.",Joey,,,,,
 Nope.,Joey,,,,,
 Nope.,Joey,,,,,
 Not from where I was standin'.,Joey,,,,,
" I went back to Riff's. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, and she brought me a tuna melt and four plates of curly fries.",Joey,,,,,
 She is so hot.,Joey,,,,,
 Pheebs? You think it would be ok if I asked out your sister?,Joey,,,,,
" So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there.",Joey,,,,,
" Cool, thanks.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Phoebe, could you do me a favor? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, no no no. It's for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size wise.",Joey,,,,,
 Yep. Ice Capades.,Joey,,,,,
" I don't know. I like her, you know. She's different. There's uh, somethin about her that--",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Phoebe, I asked you and you said it was ok.",Joey,,,,,
" Ok, well maybe now I'm not ok with it not being ok.",Joey,,,,,
 Out.,Joey,,,,,
 Yes.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, not that it's any of your business, but, no, we haven't, ok? You meant s*x, right?",Joey,,,,,
 Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.,Joey,,,,,
 He should take the sack?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking. Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?",Joey,,,,,
 I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.,Joey,,,,,
 When's that?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?",Joey,,,,,
" What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 Your sister stood me up the other night.,Joey,,,,,
" I've been trying for two days. When I call the restaurant, they say she's too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.",Joey,,,,,
" Urs, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.",Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no, don't say ""listen"". I know that ""listen"". I've said that ""listen"".",Joey,,,,,
 I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?,Joey,,,,,
 You don't drink,Joey,,,,,
 Urs--,Joey,,,,,
 Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?,Joey,,,,,
" No. No, I, I couldn't do that.",Joey,,,,,
" Then, uh, then I'm sorry.",Joey,,,,,
" I know. I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or what, but you have never looked so beautiful.",Joey,,,,,
 Pheebs?,Joey,,,,,
 We just got the message.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few.",Joey,,,,,
 Shut up!,Joey,,,,,
 Thank you.,Joey,,,,,
" There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.",Joey,,,,,
" Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz--[look of realization]",Joey,,,,,
 About what?,Joey,,,,,
 Heh... I was bluffing.,Joey,,,,,
" You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?",Joey,,,,,
 [pause]...Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
" No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.",Joey,,,,,
" Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.",Joey,,,,,
" But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. [gets up]",Joey,,,,,
 That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.,Joey,,,,,
 Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?,Joey,,,,,
" Me too. Alright, whattaya got.",Joey,,,,,
" Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. [the girls look at him, confused] Oh, I'm out.",Joey,,,,,
" Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.",Joey,,,,,
 Check.,Joey,,,,,
" That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?",Joey,,,,,
" Here, I got five, I got five. [Ross takes the money]",Joey,,,,,
" [to Ross]: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh!,Joey,,,,,
 [triumphantly] The Unbearable Likeness of Being!,Joey,,,,,
 Suck-fest.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.",Joey,,,,,
 I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.,Joey,,,,,
" I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.",Joey,,,,,
 She really said that?,Joey,,,,,
 'Tonight' tonight?,Joey,,,,,
 How could you lose him?,Joey,,,,,
 Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?,Joey,,,,,
 Marcel?,Joey,,,,,
 Marcel?,Joey,,,,,
 A monkey.,Joey,,,,,
" Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh. Then, no.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?",Joey,,,,,
" We can't, alright? [To the women] We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.",Joey,,,,,
 Marcel?,Joey,,,,,
" I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and s*x.",Joey,,,,,
" No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.",Joey,,,,,
 Her answer machine?,Joey,,,,,
" Duh, where've you been?",Joey,,,,,
" Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!",Joey,,,,,
" Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.",Joey,,,,,
 Maybe she never got your message.,Joey,,,,,
 He's back! The peeper's back!,Joey,,,,,
 (DUCKING) Get down!,Joey,,,,,
 (INTRIGUED) Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
 ..Naughty!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (EXIT RACHEL, SLAMMING DOOR IN HIS FACE) That's fine, yeah...",Joey,,,,,
 (WATCHES THEM FOR A WHILE) Oh my.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, you know our phone's not working?",Joey,,,,,
" I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",Joey,,,,,
" (TO MONICA) Can I use your phone? (ON PHONE) Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? (TO THE GANG) Sidney's a woman.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. Yeah, so what? (TO PHONE) Look, I live across the street, (WALKING TO WINDOW) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like- Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... mostly free weights, but occasionally..",Joey,,,,,
" (STILL ON PHONE) Yeah, my neighbour... Yeah, the brunette... (TO MONICA) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.",Joey,,,,,
 Big day.,Joey,,,,,
" All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...",Joey,,,,,
 How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?,Joey,,,,,
" No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.",Joey,,,,,
" Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. [Waitress looks at him funny] Which I'm not.",Joey,,,,,
 Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.,Joey,,,,,
" [Writes it down] Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.",Joey,,,,,
 Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!,Joey,,,,,
 Where've you been?,Joey,,,,,
 [To Chandler] Hey! He beat ya.,Joey,,,,,
" I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!",Joey,,,,,
 Isn't there any way you can keep him?,Joey,,,,,
 How do you get a monkey into a zoo?,Joey,,,,,
 Did you call the cops?,Joey,,,,,
 You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?,Joey,,,,,
 Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!,Joey,,,,,
 Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?,Joey,,,,,
" We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing-",Joey,,,,,
" I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.",Joey,,,,,
" Marcel, I'm hungry.",Joey,,,,,
" Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.",Joey,,,,,
 Holden McGroin.,Joey,,,,,
 Exellent dream score.,Joey,,,,,
 I donīt know. What are you wearing?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.",Joey,,,,,
 What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?,Joey,,,,,
 How young is young Ethan? Young?,Joey,,,,,
 Whoa!,Joey,,,,,
 Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesnīt mean...,Joey,,,,,
" All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.",Joey,,,,,
" Services? Oh, services.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hey. How was the first day?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh... Yeah, you do.",Joey,,,,,
 [reaches for hi scones] My scones.,Joey,,,,,
 All right.,Joey,,,,,
" So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest ""Power Ranger"" is?",Joey,,,,,
 Stegosaurus!,Joey,,,,,
 What about André?,Joey,,,,,
 Theyīre here allready?,Joey,,,,,
" Uh, moist, yeah.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, all right. [he comes out from their apartment with a huge sandwich in his hand]",Joey,,,,,
 For the ride.,Joey,,,,,
" All rihgt, Iīm going. Iīm going.",Joey,,,,,
 Do we have to know about that?,Joey,,,,,
" I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.",Joey,,,,,
" [to the screen] Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, listen, lady....[sees that she's pregnant]...whoa.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh yeah? And who do you like?,Joey,,,,,
" The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?",Joey,,,,,
" Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, oh, oh, sorry.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.",Joey,,,,,
 Tribbiani.,Joey,,,,,
" [takes phone] Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. [pause] Yeah, I'm single. [pause] 25. An actor. [pause] Hello?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?",Joey,,,,,
" Ok, look, maybe I should just go.",Joey,,,,,
" Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?",Joey,,,,,
 You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, it is.",Joey,,,,,
 It is.,Joey,,,,,
 Ew! What is that? Something exploded!,Joey,,,,,
" [panicked] Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?",Joey,,,,,
" Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's-- [notices the nurse looking at him strangely] I was just--yeah, right. Push! Push!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, just had a baby.",Joey,,,,,
 Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.,Joey,,,,,
" Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.",Joey,,,,,
" He doesn't do much, does he?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.",Joey,,,,,
" I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.",Joey,,,,,
 Well... I'm helping out down at the NYU Med School with some... research.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, just, y'know.... science.",Joey,,,,,
 [sigh]... It's a fertility study.,Joey,,,,,
" Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.",Joey,,,,,
 We make fire. Cook meat.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, OK.",Joey,,,,,
" I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.",Joey,,,,,
" What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have s*x with me.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 The country?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?,Joey,,,,,
" He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.",Joey,,,,,
" Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.",Joey,,,,,
" We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. [Joey gives Ross a hug]",Joey,,,,,
" Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I--",Joey,,,,,
" Then you do. Heh, heh.",Joey,,,,,
 What do you mean?,Joey,,,,,
 Not following you.,Joey,,,,,
 [to Rachel]: That book got me through some tough times.,Joey,,,,,
" [pats Chandler on the leg] That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.",Joey,,,,,
 The country.,Joey,,,,,
" He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.",Joey,,,,,
" Heh, heh. It was nothin'.",Joey,,,,,
" [panicked] Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.",Joey,,,,,
 Sure! Why not?,Joey,,,,,
 How do you mean?,Joey,,,,,
 Shhhh!,Joey,,,,,
 She's still asleep.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!",Joey,,,,,
" It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.",Joey,,,,,
 I know! Neither did I!,Joey,,,,,
 Seven hundred bucks!,Joey,,,,,
" Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.",Joey,,,,,
" What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? [Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.]",Joey,,,,,
" Um, this?",Joey,,,,,
" Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie.",Joey,,,,,
 Needs some clothes altered?,Joey,,,,,
" Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?",Joey,,,,,
" You know, I think I was sixteen.",Joey,,,,,
" No no no no no, I'm not fallin' for that again.",Joey,,,,,
" Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey says hello. He'll know what it means.",Joey,,,,,
 Can we see her?,Joey,,,,,
 How're you doing?,Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, that bad, huh? Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.",Joey,,,,,
 You gotta tell Ross how you feel.,Joey,,,,,
 What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.,Joey,,,,,
" Look, Rache, Rache, I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.",Joey,,,,,
 Frankie? What're you talking about?,Joey,,,,,
 No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.,Joey,,,,,
" That's how they do pants. First they go up one side, they move it over, they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?",Joey,,,,,
 What? That's not? Oh my god.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...",Joey,,,,,
" I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.",Joey,,,,,
" I gotta get one, too.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, does it hurt?",Joey,,,,,
 Chandler?,Joey,,,,,
" Ok, I got one, I got one. If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?",Joey,,,,,
 Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?,Joey,,,,,
 Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.,Joey,,,,,
 Who?,Joey,,,,,
 What's he doin' in my section?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?",Joey,,,,,
" Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. Bijan for men?,Joey,,,,,
" Bijan for men? Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work we could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men?",Joey,,,,,
 What is the big deal?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh--",Joey,,,,,
 Exactly.,Joey,,,,,
" Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.",Joey,,,,,
" Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.",Joey,,,,,
" I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah I guess you're right.,Joey,,,,,
 I'm gonna do it.,Joey,,,,,
" Mornin'. I said, mornin'.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I'm ready.",Joey,,,,,
" These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?",Joey,,,,,
" Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.",Joey,,,,,
" You guys are messin' with me, right?",Joey,,,,,
" That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, ""whoa.""",Joey,,,,,
" ""Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!""",Joey,,,,,
 Such as?,Joey,,,,,
 Check this out. Can I have this?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.",Joey,,,,,
" Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.",Joey,,,,,
" ""Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.",Joey,,,,,
 That's what it says.,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" So, you were both dorks. Big deal.",Joey,,,,,
 Have you been here all night?,Joey,,,,,
" Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.",Joey,,,,,
" Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.",Joey,,,,,
" I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?",Joey,,,,,
" You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?",Joey,,,,,
 Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.,Joey,,,,,
" Geez, look how fat she got.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?",Joey,,,,,
 You want his yearbook?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah.",Joey,,,,,
" This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?",Joey,,,,,
 I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.,Joey,,,,,
" I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.",Joey,,,,,
" Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' s*x on it.",Joey,,,,,
 What happens if you flick it?,Joey,,,,,
 Foxy lady.,Joey,,,,,
 The Ice Capades?,Joey,,,,,
" I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people. [Chandler puts the tape in]",Joey,,,,,
" Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have s*x. And then I say, wait, here's my line, [Joey from TV] you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.",Joey,,,,,
" Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .",Joey,,,,,
" Me too, we should get goin'.",Joey,,,,,
 I got time.,Joey,,,,,
" Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?",Joey,,,,,
 Do we need a cake?,Joey,,,,,
 All right.,Joey,,,,,
" Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.",Joey,,,,,
" Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying ""let's go here, let's go there"". Like we can afford to go here and there.",Joey,,,,,
 For Ross.,Joey,,,,,
 Hi.,Joey,,,,,
" If it's not you, this is a horrible story.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, someplace nice. (to Phoebe and Rachel) How much do you think I can get for my kidney? (at Central Perk)",Joey,,,,,
 Cool.,Joey,,,,,
" Sorry, sorry.",Joey,,,,,
" What are these, like famous chickens?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?",Joey,,,,,
 Thank you.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.",Joey,,,,,
" 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Thanks.,Joey,,,,,
" Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--",Joey,,,,,
 Charity.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.",Joey,,,,,
 Me too.,Joey,,,,,
 Fine.,Joey,,,,,
" Come on you guys, one more time.",Joey,,,,,
 Nooo.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.",Joey,,,,,
 You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?,Joey,,,,,
 And we don't work hard?,Joey,,,,,
 And you feel like we hold you back.,Joey,,,,,
 Let me get that. (to Chandler) You got five bucks?,Joey,,,,,
 Cool.,Joey,,,,,
" Goo, goo, goo, waaah!",Joey,,,,,
" Are you ok, Ross?",Joey,,,,,
 Is he gonna be ok?,Joey,,,,,
" What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?",Joey,,,,,
" Hat, milk, got it.",Joey,,,,,
 Consider it done.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.",Joey,,,,,
" It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.",Joey,,,,,
" No, seriously.",Joey,,,,,
 You wanna smell him?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.",Joey,,,,,
 (to Chandler) What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hey, look at that talent.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Get outta here. This is our stop too.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?",Joey,,,,,
" Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.",Joey,,,,,
 I'm him.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.",Joey,,,,,
" Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Ahh!,Joey,,,,,
" Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.",Joey,,,,,
 You got a better idea? ,Joey,,,,,
 Heads.,Joey,,,,,
 Yes! Whew!,Joey,,,,,
" Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.",Joey,,,,,
 Yes! There's still pie.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.",Joey,,,,,
" The guy still won't put out, huh?",Joey,,,,,
" Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.",Joey,,,,,
 Maybe he's. . . gay.,Joey,,,,,
" Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?",Joey,,,,,
" But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?",Joey,,,,,
 [to Ross] You're getting a cat?,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, ""Excellent butt, great rack.""",Joey,,,,,
" Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey Phoebs.,Joey,,,,,
 I can't find the remote. [Phoebe turns off the TV] Thank you.,Joey,,,,,
 And?,Joey,,,,,
" All right Phoebs, way to go.",Joey,,,,,
" So, so how did it happen?",Joey,,,,,
 And what did he say?,Joey,,,,,
 Wow.,Joey,,,,,
" Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.",Joey,,,,,
 This man is my God.,Joey,,,,,
 Tongue?,Joey,,,,,
 Cool.,Joey,,,,,
" [reading over her shoulder] Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?",Joey,,,,,
" No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then... [rubs his fingers together]",Joey,,,,,
 You got all that from saline solution?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, here's a thought, Ross. [reaches for the computer]",Joey,,,,,
" Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.",Joey,,,,,
" Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.",Joey,,,,,
 You could say that.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.",Joey,,,,,
" [to Ross] Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?",Joey,,,,,
" He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.",Joey,,,,,
" [opens the drapes] Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah, I do.",Joey,,,,,
" [quietly] I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? [Ross stares blankly at him] Maybe a little longer.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?",Joey,,,,,
 You gave him cookies?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh my God.,Joey,,,,,
" Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.",Joey,,,,,
" I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.",Joey,,,,,
 C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.,Joey,,,,,
" So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.",Joey,,,,,
 She told us.,Joey,,,,,
" Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.",Joey,,,,,
 Phoebe here with the cab yet?,Joey,,,,,
" Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, here she comes.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, big stuff.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey. [Phoebe takes off, Joey and Chandler are thrown back in the seat]",Joey,,,,,
 Sure is.,Joey,,,,,
 Good luck Phoebs.,Joey,,,,,
 How far'd ya get?,Joey,,,,,
" Phoebs, what's goin' on?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.",Joey,,,,,
" Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.",Joey,,,,,
" Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.",Joey,,,,,
" Rach, these are for you.",Joey,,,,,
" No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.",Joey,,,,,
 Uh-huh.,Joey,,,,,
" And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.",Joey,,,,,
 They're ribbed for your pleasure.,Joey,,,,,
 I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.,Joey,,,,,
" Here it is, here it is. [reading from newspaper] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.",Joey,,,,,
 Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.,Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.",Joey,,,,,
" When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.",Joey,,,,,
" No, I'm alright man. Really.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... [Fun Bobby picks Joey up off the ground, bounces him. Joey laughs.] Alright! It still works.",Joey,,,,,
 I just had a glass.,Joey,,,,,
 [realizing what everyone else did a minute ago] Ooooooh.,Joey,,,,,
" Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!",Joey,,,,,
 With a man?,Joey,,,,,
" What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.",Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
" OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, the part's mine if I want it.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.",Joey,,,,,
" Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?",Joey,,,,,
 I've never slept with someone for a part.,Joey,,,,,
 Sorry.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. [pause] You know, after having slept with her.",Joey,,,,,
" I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.",Joey,,,,,
" But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.",Joey,,,,,
" Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!",Joey,,,,,
 Alright... I've got to go shower. [leaves],Joey,,,,,
" It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..",Joey,,,,,
 Are you really not going?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.",Joey,,,,,
" No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.",Joey,,,,,
" It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.",Joey,,,,,
" There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] ""Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.",Joey,,,,,
 I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.,Joey,,,,,
" All right, all right. ""Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!""",Joey,,,,,
 I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.,Joey,,,,,
" Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?",Joey,,,,,
" Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?",Joey,,,,,
 They didn't fight a lot?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, look who's up.",Joey,,,,,
" I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!",Joey,,,,,
" It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.",Joey,,,,,
 [to a wedding guest] How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? [the guy nods] I wrapped those bad boys.,Joey,,,,,
 I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? [They all look at Chandler],Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.",Joey,,,,,
" No, my first fan mail.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?",Joey,,,,,
" Ah, the stalker.",Joey,,,,,
 Let's get out of here.,Joey,,,,,
" OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.",Joey,,,,,
 She's comin'.,Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?",Joey,,,,,
 Erica.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah it is. . . what?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.",Joey,,,,,
 No one.,Joey,,,,,
" Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. [laughs hysterically]",Joey,,,,,
" Alright, just one. [she licks his hands rather emphatically] Wow, you're good at that.",Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.",Joey,,,,,
 But that's what...,Joey,,,,,
 Hey I- [she cuts him off with a kiss],Joey,,,,,
" That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! [she starts nibbling his hand] Hey. He-hey.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey Erica, c'mon in.",Joey,,,,,
" Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?",Joey,,,,,
 Who?,Joey,,,,,
" It's not what you think, that was...",Joey,,,,,
" Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.",Joey,,,,,
 Somebody wanna help me out here?,Joey,,,,,
 'Cause it's a television show.,Joey,,,,,
 I'm not Drake.,Joey,,,,,
" Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.",Joey,,,,,
" Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care",Joey,,,,,
" OK, alright, the people who threw the water.",Joey,,,,,
 This is amazing.,Joey,,,,,
 I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.,Joey,,,,,
 Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey. [guard lets them in],Joey,,,,,
" Woah, dude, burn.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?",Joey,,,,,
" Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.",Joey,,,,,
 You're blowin' me off for a monkey?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.",Joey,,,,,
 Oooh.,Joey,,,,,
" Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?",Joey,,,,,
 Forget about it.,Joey,,,,,
" So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.",Joey,,,,,
 So what're you guys gonna eat?,Joey,,,,,
 Ma?,Joey,,,,,
" Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.",Joey,,,,,
 Are you naked in there?,Joey,,,,,
" Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?",Joey,,,,,
" Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, let me see.",Joey,,,,,
" Alright, alright. [climbs up in the next stall and looks over at Chandler] Woah, someone's flossing.",Joey,,,,,
 Chandler's wearing panties.,Joey,,,,,
" Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie.",Joey,,,,,
" One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.",Joey,,,,,
 Aaaaagggghhhhh.,Joey,,,,,
 Aaaaagggghhhhh.,Joey,,,,,
 Aaaaagggghhhhh. Mommy,Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.",Joey,,,,,
 Eight hundred and twelve bucks.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me. [hands Chandler a jewelry box]",Joey,,,,,
" Heh, what d'ya say?",Joey,,,,,
" Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.",Joey,,,,,
 Put it on.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. [gets the bracelet from the drawer] You put this on, you're good to go. [puts the bracelet on Chandler] Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.",Joey,,,,,
 You have any idea what this'll do for your s*x life?,Joey,,,,,
" If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?",Joey,,,,,
" You know what the. . . [sees Chandler on his knees, holding the couch cushions]",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 How come you have two?,Joey,,,,,
 Get out.,Joey,,,,,
" Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.",Joey,,,,,
" [pulls out a VCR tape] Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?",Joey,,,,,
 What is with your nose?,Joey,,,,,
 Some girl ate Monica.,Joey,,,,,
 Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.,Joey,,,,,
" Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.",Joey,,,,,
 Alright open your eyes. [opens his eyes to see two black leather recliners and a big screen TV],Joey,,,,,
 Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.,Joey,,,,,
 I know.,Joey,,,,,
 Uh-huh.,Joey,,,,,
" Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. [Chandler starts to sit in one of the chairs] Not that one.",Joey,,,,,
" [sits down] Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.",Joey,,,,,
 We dare.,Joey,,,,,
 What if we have to pee?,Joey,,,,,
" Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.",Joey,,,,,
 Hi.,Joey,,,,,
 What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?,Joey,,,,,
 She laughed at you?,Joey,,,,,
 It certainly is a miracle.,Joey,,,,,
" No, inside good, outside bad.",Joey,,,,,
" [uses a dentist mirror to see] Naa, she's lyin'.",Joey,,,,,
 Is that the fire alarm?,Joey,,,,,
 Cool.,Joey,,,,,
 Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, so.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?",Joey,,,,,
" Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.",Joey,,,,,
" Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?",Joey,,,,,
 So where you gettin' it?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?",Joey,,,,,
 Can you believe this place?,Joey,,,,,
" Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.",Joey,,,,,
 Huh?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?",Joey,,,,,
 Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.,Joey,,,,,
" Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.",Joey,,,,,
" Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.",Joey,,,,,
" I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.",Joey,,,,,
" What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.",Joey,,,,,
 Well that's how I feel.,Joey,,,,,
 Well then maybe I will.,Joey,,,,,
" Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .",Joey,,,,,
 I know. Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" No, we're alright.",Joey,,,,,
 Plastic spoons. Great.,Joey,,,,,
" These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.",Joey,,,,,
 I'm movin' out like we talked about.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.",Joey,,,,,
 Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.",Joey,,,,,
" Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.",Joey,,,,,
" Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?",Joey,,,,,
" Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.",Joey,,,,,
 Yes! And the table is mine.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.",Joey,,,,,
" Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.",Joey,,,,,
" So, I guess this is it.",Joey,,,,,
" Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.",Joey,,,,,
" Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.",Joey,,,,,
 Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.,Joey,,,,,
 Art.,Joey,,,,,
" Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?",Joey,,,,,
" Right, I go-, I got it.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. [leads them to the bathroom, gestures towards toilet, everyone stares, uncomprehending] Heh?",Joey,,,,,
" No no no, behind it.",Joey,,,,,
" That's right, I have a phone in here.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Hello.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.",Joey,,,,,
" Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, well great.",Joey,,,,,
 Well OK then. [oven timer goes off behind Chandler] Was that the oven timer?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?",Joey,,,,,
" Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hey, they're runnin'",Joey,,,,,
" I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.",Joey,,,,,
" You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?,Joey,,,,,
" Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. [grabs moose hat] It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?",Joey,,,,,
 Wow.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, now it's a spare room?",Joey,,,,,
" Well I uh, got what I came for. [puts on moose hat] I'll uh, I'll see you guys.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah he is. [leaves]",Joey,,,,,
 Eddie.,Joey,,,,,
" Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. [looks for the mail on the table by the door, it's not there] Where's the mail?",Joey,,,,,
 You don't keep it over here on this table any more?,Joey,,,,,
 Huh.,Joey,,,,,
" No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.",Joey,,,,,
 So how you two gettin' along?,Joey,,,,,
" Great, well, I'm happy for ya. [picks up the orange juice carton and it's empty] Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.",Joey,,,,,
" Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?",Joey,,,,,
 Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.,Joey,,,,,
 [sings] It may not be a bed of roses.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.",Joey,,,,,
" Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.",Joey,,,,,
" Page 42, page 42, page 42.",Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, I look good.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'",Joey,,,,,
" Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?",Joey,,,,,
" I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?",Joey,,,,,
" They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.",Joey,,,,,
" No. No way, I'm not signing that.",Joey,,,,,
 How can they do this to me?,Joey,,,,,
 I don't feel like talkin.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.",Joey,,,,,
" Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.",Joey,,,,,
" Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.",Joey,,,,,
" No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.",Joey,,,,,
" No, that means nothin to me.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?",Joey,,,,,
" Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.",Joey,,,,,
 Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.,Joey,,,,,
 Anybody want a croan.,Joey,,,,,
" So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?",Joey,,,,,
" No, can we get back to me?",Joey,,,,,
 Alright. Cab driver number two?,Joey,,,,,
 But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?,Joey,,,,,
" But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.",Joey,,,,,
 I'm sorry. See ya.,Joey,,,,,
 What is it?,Joey,,,,,
" See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.",Joey,,,,,
 It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh my God.,Joey,,,,,
" Look at this, how did I spend so much money?",Joey,,,,,
 Ahh.,Joey,,,,,
" My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 That's a two line part.,Joey,,,,,
 So what.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.",Joey,,,,,
" Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'",Joey,,,,,
" Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.",Joey,,,,,
" Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.",Joey,,,,,
 Well don't just say.,Joey,,,,,
 Ok.,Joey,,,,,
" I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.",Joey,,,,,
" Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.",Joey,,,,,
 I fell down an elevator shaft.,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything. ",Joey,,,,,
" And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.",Joey,,,,,
" No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day. [gets up and leaves]",Joey,,,,,
" Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.",Joey,,,,,
 They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.,Joey,,,,,
 Thanks Ross.,Joey,,,,,
 I went.,Joey,,,,,
 I didn't get it.,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 Huh?,Joey,,,,,
" [movers removing a glass parrot] Oh, not my parrot.",Joey,,,,,
 I can't watch this.,Joey,,,,,
" Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.",Joey,,,,,
 Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.,Joey,,,,,
 Hello.,Joey,,,,,
 I know I would.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey no problem.,Joey,,,,,
" Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...",Joey,,,,,
 A little foos?,Joey,,,,,
 What happened to the foosball?,Joey,,,,,
 He paid a lot of money for it.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.",Joey,,,,,
" Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.",Joey,,,,,
" No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.",Joey,,,,,
" Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?",Joey,,,,,
 I don't know.,Joey,,,,,
 How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?,Joey,,,,,
" [Monica walks back in the kitchen] Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. [With money in his palm] Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats [shakes his had and passes the dollar].",Joey,,,,,
 No problem. Hey Chandler,Joey,,,,,
 Ok.,Joey,,,,,
 He-he-eyy. [Shakes his had and passes the dollar],Joey,,,,,
 Ok. He kept my dollar.,Joey,,,,,
 How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?,Joey,,,,,
" Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.",Joey,,,,,
 We're the guys.,Joey,,,,,
 Man you are incredible.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.",Joey,,,,,
" No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. [Chandler starts kicking him below the table] I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Nooooo.,Joey,,,,,
 Not a dad.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?",Joey,,,,,
 Freaky.,Joey,,,,,
" Monica, relax, go get a beer.",Joey,,,,,
 Who said it was for you?,Joey,,,,,
 You're kiddin'.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.",Joey,,,,,
 Do what?,Joey,,,,,
" See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah good luck, good luck.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?",Joey,,,,,
" Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.",Joey,,,,,
" Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?",Joey,,,,,
 Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hey, hey no.",Joey,,,,,
" Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.",Joey,,,,,
" Phoebs, he's just a little dog. [turns back to the car window and the dog is halfway through it.] Ahhh.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?",Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'",Joey,,,,,
" Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.",Joey,,,,,
 How come those?,Joey,,,,,
 That is so not my motto.,Joey,,,,,
 Good.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.",Joey,,,,,
 [dials the phone] It's a woman.,Joey,,,,,
" [in a fake voice] Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. [hangs up]",Joey,,,,,
 [in the voice] Hard to say.,Joey,,,,,
" [walks out of his room] Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?",Joey,,,,,
 By someone besides Monica?,Joey,,,,,
" He-he-he, how's it goin'?",Joey,,,,,
 Excellent.,Joey,,,,,
 Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?,Joey,,,,,
" Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.",Joey,,,,,
" Cause she uh, she steals stuff.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.",Joey,,,,,
" I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.",Joey,,,,,
" [peeks back out] Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, [sees that the coast is clear] oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.",Joey,,,,,
 Right this is staging.,Joey,,,,,
" [as they're walking out, Dr. Greene questioningly gestures at the Happy Birthday sign over the door] This is clearly in the wrong apartment. [they all walk across the hall]",Joey,,,,,
 Quick volleyball question.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?",Joey,,,,,
" Ahh, you drive safe.",Joey,,,,,
" Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. [grabs her and kisses her to distract her. She goes limp in his arms. Mr. Greene leaves.] Well, ok, you take care.",Joey,,,,,
 Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh no, what happened?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I've had it.",Joey,,,,,
 But don't you need experience for a job like that?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.",Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.",Joey,,,,,
 Ha-ha. [Scott leaves] Are all you processors dorks?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?",Joey,,,,,
 I figure my character has kids.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.",Joey,,,,,
" You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.",Joey,,,,,
 What a phony.,Joey,,,,,
 Sir.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah Bing, what's that about?",Joey,,,,,
 This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.,Joey,,,,,
" Joseph's good, isn't he?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.",Joey,,,,,
" Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.,Joey,,,,,
 'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.,Joey,,,,,
" Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.",Joey,,,,,
" What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.",Joey,,,,,
 Karen.,Joey,,,,,
 Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.,Joey,,,,,
 Really?,Joey,,,,,
" Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.",Joey,,,,,
" It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot. [Chadler pushes him out the door by the face.]",Joey,,,,,
 Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.,Joey,,,,,
 All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.",Joey,,,,,
" No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.",Joey,,,,,
" I did do it, I'm a professional.",Joey,,,,,
" See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother. ",Joey,,,,,
" Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.",Joey,,,,,
" Come on, I need your help here.",Joey,,,,,
" You see this, this is a friend.",Joey,,,,,
 Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, that makes sense. (looks at Ross)",Joey,,,,,
" Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. (Chandler ignores him) Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.",Joey,,,,,
" Aww, Rach, I think you look cute (kisses her on the cheek, then looks at Ross) And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon (goes to kiss him).",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him (runs out)",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Man, I got this close to him (holds up his fingers) and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.",Joey,,,,,
" Aw, man I'm sorry (starts rubbing Chandler's shoulder). This must be very tough for ya, huh (and starts comfroting him looking for a kiss).",Joey,,,,,
" Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello? (picks up a statue of an Indian and walks into",Joey,,,,,
" Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.",Joey,,,,,
 I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.,Joey,,,,,
" Morning, hey, you made pancakes?",Joey,,,,,
 (sarcastically) Good morning.,Joey,,,,,
 (under his breath) Kiss her! Kiss her!,Joey,,,,,
 B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.,Joey,,,,,
" Come on, quite yankin' me.",Joey,,,,,
 This is Janice.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.,Joey,,,,,
 Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?,Joey,,,,,
 There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?",Joey,,,,,
 Wheel!,Joey,,,,,
 Fortune! This guy is so stupid. (yelling) It's Count Rushmore!!,Joey,,,,,
" I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?",Joey,,,,,
" Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.",Joey,,,,,
" No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandler follows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?",Joey,,,,,
" Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?",Joey,,,,,
" Look, what do you want me to say?",Joey,,,,,
" I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain? (Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')",Joey,,,,,
" I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.",Joey,,,,,
 And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...,Joey,,,,,
 But what does that gonna do...,Joey,,,,,
 Okay. I'm in.,Joey,,,,,
 Does it have to be a whole day?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.",Joey,,,,,
" I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.",Joey,,,,,
" But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.",Joey,,,,,
" No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having s*x.",Joey,,,,,
" All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider. (takes a glass from the fridge.)",Joey,,,,,
" (drinks from the glass and puts it back in the fridge) Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!",Joey,,,,,
 We have a half hour.,Joey,,,,,
" Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Ross, want some cider?",Joey,,,,,
 Glass of fat?,Joey,,,,,
 What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?,Joey,,,,,
 Am I in it?,Joey,,,,,
 Whoa!,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 How is this your seat?,Joey,,,,,
 But then you left.,Joey,,,,,
" What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there (points to the bathroom). Soo...",Joey,,,,,
 All right! You can have the chair.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh my, would you look at that! (holds up crossed fingers)",Joey,,,,,
 I'm so sorry.,Joey,,,,,
" Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.",Joey,,,,,
" Monica, how are you gonna do that?",Joey,,,,,
" Wow, what a cool job. (in a machine voice) 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.",Joey,,,,,
 Now she sounded breezy.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay. (he gets up and takes the cushions with him, as he starts to leave)",Joey,,,,,
" You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.",Joey,,,,,
 That's right! I'm taking the essence.,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Where's my underwear?!,Joey,,,,,
" Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.",Joey,,,,,
 It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, opposite, is opposite! (leaves)",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.",Joey,,,,,
 Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.",Joey,,,,,
 You could drink the fat.,Joey,,,,,
 Yaaaay!,Joey,,,,,
 Let's see what else he'll do!,Joey,,,,,
 (from bedroom) WHOAA!!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. (points to the sling he is wearing)",Joey,,,,,
 Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.,Joey,,,,,
 What is this? Fruit?,Joey,,,,,
" Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?",Joey,,,,,
 This will just be my batch.,Joey,,,,,
 Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?,Joey,,,,,
 (with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?,Joey,,,,,
" (with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe with crumbs)",Joey,,,,,
 Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!,Joey,,,,,
 Put your hands together.,Joey,,,,,
 No more jam?!,Joey,,,,,
 Check it out!! Jam crackers!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, the Knicks rule!",Joey,,,,,
" Let me see. (goes over and looks at the form) Oh, right.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, right after I did that s*x study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?",Joey,,,,,
" Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.",Joey,,,,,
" Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.",Joey,,,,,
" Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 Where you going?,Joey,,,,,
 Sperm or regular?,Joey,,,,,
" So you're really doing this, huh?",Joey,,,,,
 Sounds nice.,Joey,,,,,
" No kiddin', hmm.",Joey,,,,,
" No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.",Joey,,,,,
" I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.",Joey,,,,,
" It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.",Joey,,,,,
 He's got the body for it.,Joey,,,,,
" You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.",Joey,,,,,
" Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
" Sure! (Monica gets very depressed) But hey, you know this way sounds good too.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh Monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stops hugging her.) Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, (sees Monica) for like a day. (hugs her again).",Joey,,,,,
" I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it (tries to drink the rest of the jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc.) Maybe if they met me in person.",Joey,,,,,
 (wipes a little jam from the corner of his mouth) Did I get it?,Joey,,,,,
" You guys, can we please not watch this all right.",Joey,,,,,
" (on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills",Joey,,,,,
 Can we please turn this off?,Joey,,,,,
" (on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't,Joey,,,,,
 How is it you?,Joey,,,,,
" Yep, that's my audition.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her",Joey,,,,,
" Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to",Joey,,,,,
" What, what are you doing? What are you doing?",Joey,,,,,
" Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs",Joey,,,,,
 I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow),Joey,,,,,
" I'm sorry, it just felt nice.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, you know about that?!",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the",Joey,,,,,
" Come on baby, come on!",Joey,,,,,
 Thank you so much.,Joey,,,,,
" You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see",Joey,,,,,
" Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at",Joey,,,,,
" Nooo, four.",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?,Joey,,,,,
 Pheebs! There you are!,Joey,,,,,
" But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! (catches her in the",Joey,,,,,
" Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything?",Joey,,,,,
" It's okay, these things happen.",Joey,,,,,
" I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)",Joey,,,,,
" No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had!",Joey,,,,,
 They actually said that?,Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, shoot.",Joey,,,,,
 I didn't get it?,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, what else?",Joey,,,,,
 Oh.,Joey,,,,,
" Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she",Joey,,,,,
" You do, thanks.",Joey,,,,,
 Wait a minute.,Joey,,,,,
" Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get",Joey,,,,,
" (in a really, really bad Italian accent) That's-ah what I",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 No. Y'know how we’re always saying we need a place for the mail.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.",Joey,,,,,
" No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It’s a one day job, max.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente’s.",Joey,,,,,
 Power saw kinda got away from me there.,Joey,,,,,
 Her what?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Monica, who would yours be?",Joey,,,,,
" It’s just a game Mon. (makes a ‘Can-you-believe-her’ face to the rest of the gang.) Rach, how about you?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey-hey!,Joey,,,,,
 I know.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I’m sorry. Did I get ‘ya?",Joey,,,,,
" Calm down, do you want this unit or not?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, you should’ve told me that before, I’m not a mind reader. Hey, we’re out of beer. I’m going to Monica’s.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.",Joey,,,,,
" Nothing. It’s just old and dingy, that’s all.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. (Monica gasps) Yeah.",Joey,,,,,
" Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in his tight pants.)",Joey,,,,,
" (manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It’d take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)",Joey,,,,,
 Eh! There you go.,Joey,,,,,
" (yelling from bathroom) Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.",Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, very official.",Joey,,,,,
 Why don’t we just go on two.,Joey,,,,,
 Because it’s faster.,Joey,,,,,
" All right, but in the future...",Joey,,,,,
 So we are going on two?,Joey,,,,,
" Wow, it’s big!",Joey,,,,,
" Maybe, my ruler’s wrong.",Joey,,,,,
" Look it’s not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.",Joey,,,,,
 Y'know what?,Joey,,,,,
 I bet ‘ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center),Joey,,,,,
" Get out your checkbook, mister.",Joey,,,,,
 You are dogged man! I totally fit!,Joey,,,,,
" Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinks are on me!",Joey,,,,,
" Well, that’s really a different question.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, but let’s say there was. How might that go?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, there’s a dog out there!",Joey,,,,,
" Don’t you ah, don’t you wanna ask me any questions?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, ah, I’m an actor. I’m fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don’t worry I’m totally okay with the gay thing.",Joey,,,,,
" Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I’m totally cool with that.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! (goes into the apartment),Joey,,,,,
" Oh, no thanks, I got it. (picks it up) No I don’t!",Joey,,,,,
" Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.",Joey,,,,,
" That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination.",Joey,,,,,
 Like you wouldn’t believe. (they go into the apartment) Wow! This is a great place.,Joey,,,,,
 Gotcha.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, you bet I am!",Joey,,,,,
" You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?",Joey,,,,,
" Whoa, ah!! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh right, right.",Joey,,,,,
" Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk.",Joey,,,,,
 Baywatch.,Joey,,,,,
 Lifeguards.,Joey,,,,,
 Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.,Joey,,,,,
" They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?",Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no, don’t get up, I got a cooler right here.",Joey,,,,,
 Cool!!,Joey,,,,,
" Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?",Joey,,,,,
 Booo!!,Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Hey, you guys!",Joey,,,,,
 Guess what?,Joey,,,,,
 I got a gig!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, it’s not a part, no. I’m teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah. It’s like my chance to give something back to the acting community.",Joey,,,,,
 (glares at him) I know!,Joey,,,,,
" Good evening. I’m Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don’t have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.",Joey,,,,,
 Hi!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, ’Hey, the bell doesn’t dismiss you, I dismiss you.’",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, it’s this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I’m so, so right for it, y'know, he’s just like me. Except he’s a boxer, and has an evil twin.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?",Joey,,,,,
 You want me to lie to Chandler?,Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, you’re ah, pretty good at this.",Joey,,,,,
 Ahh!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey now!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!!! Oww!! And I’m bleeding.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, great.",Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 All right. I can’t see.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’ (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fishhook.) Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that’s how it’s done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey-hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Awww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud.",Joey,,,,,
 You bet! What’s the part?,Joey,,,,,
 Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers?,Joey,,,,,
 Whoa. That was really good.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I-I might’ve said supergay.",Joey,,,,,
" Because, Monica, the guy’s so good, and I really, really want this part.",Joey,,,,,
" (sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when you’ll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I’m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he’s got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from his students.) Thank you.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh-ho-kay, I’m talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)",Joey,,,,,
" (entering with Monica) Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way",Joey,,,,,
" It’ll kill him. I mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him.",Joey,,,,,
 (looking out the window) Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his,Joey,,,,,
 What did they do?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey, Ross?",Joey,,,,,
 I’ve got a science question.,Joey,,,,,
" If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact ‘Homo-sapien’, is that why",Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey, I’m not judging.",Joey,,,,,
 I’d really prefer a mountain bike.,Joey,,,,,
" Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do,",Joey,,,,,
" (stopping him) No, no, you can’t, you can’t, okay, you can’t,",Joey,,,,,
" Oh God. Uh, okay, here’s the thing, this is the thing, okay, the",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. I went down to the ‘Mattress King’ showroom and,",Joey,,,,,
 They were in his office.,Joey,,,,,
" I’m telling you man, I saw it.",Joey,,,,,
 I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema,Joey,,,,,
 You said number two.,Joey,,,,,
 I know. (giggles harder),Joey,,,,,
 Uh.,Joey,,,,,
 Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the,Joey,,,,,
" I’m tellin’ ya, he hasn’t moved since this morning.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, there is one way. His window’s open, I say, we poke",Joey,,,,,
" Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no",Joey,,,,,
" Well, now we got a reason.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, we’re fashioning a very long poking device.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey uh, what’s a matter?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh my God, is she going back to him?",Joey,,,,,
" What are you ah, what are you gonna do?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, it doesn’t matter what I would do.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, you’re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if",Joey,,,,,
" They have a kid together, y'know. They’re like, they’re like a",Joey,,,,,
" All right now remember, something this big and long is going to",Joey,,,,,
" All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke. (they start to",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, retract the device, retract the device.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?",Joey,,,,,
" Great, you can cover Chandler.",Joey,,,,,
 Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.,Joey,,,,,
" Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don’t play, everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even. Come on.",Joey,,,,,
 Says who? Your mom?,Joey,,,,,
" All right, we have to pick captains.",Joey,,,,,
 Thank you.,Joey,,,,,
" (to his team) All right, huddle up, right over here.",Joey,,,,,
 I got it. (catches the ball),Joey,,,,,
 Set....hike!,Joey,,,,,
" Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.",Joey,,,,,
" Hi-hi, I’m Joey.",Joey,,,,,
" I’m sorry Dutch, I didn’t get that last little bit.",Joey,,,,,
" Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.",Joey,,,,,
 Mar-klan.,Joey,,,,,
 I think so.,Joey,,,,,
" Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I’ll let you have her.",Joey,,,,,
" Well I don’t like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don’t feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You’re better with numbers and stuff.",Joey,,,,,
 Fumble!,Joey,,,,,
 What the hell’s the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.,Joey,,,,,
" All right, that’s it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.",Joey,,,,,
" Pheebs, run!",Joey,,,,,
 After!!,Joey,,,,,
" It’s hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.",Joey,,,,,
 What are you gonna do?,Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 Here you go!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it’s better if we’re on the same team.",Joey,,,,,
" Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.",Joey,,,,,
 Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.,Joey,,,,,
" Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I’m not playing with this guy, now.",Joey,,,,,
 Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn’t understand the question.,Joey,,,,,
 Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of s*x.,Joey,,,,,
" This sucks, I was just up by that much!",Joey,,,,,
 (looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!,Joey,,,,,
" When they’re hungry enough, they’ll come in.",Joey,,,,,
 And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.,Joey,,,,,
 What? Me having a job?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I’m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey. What, what are you doing here?",Joey,,,,,
" Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....",Joey,,,,,
 Sure.,Joey,,,,,
 All right.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, that’s, that’s ah, one of the old ones, he’s just taking it to the back.",Joey,,,,,
 Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, they go into the chipper.",Joey,,,,,
 (to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the ‘cut it’ motion with his hands),Joey,,,,,
" All right, I’ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus’s.",Joey,,,,,
" Look Rach, wasn’t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?",Joey,,,,,
" If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you’ve got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.",Joey,,,,,
" (entering, interrupting Rachel) Hey! I got great news!",Joey,,,,,
" What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?",Joey,,,,,
" Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?",Joey,,,,,
 Not a problem.,Joey,,,,,
 And now for the great news.,Joey,,,,,
" Only if you think it’s better than this... (holds up an aerosol can) snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it’s a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, the ah, trees that don’t fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.",Joey,,,,,
" Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.",Joey,,,,,
" (simulating an echo) Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... (Chandler hits him in the back of the head) Okay, Blast off!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?",Joey,,,,,
" All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the card before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a little while) 5 of hearts.",Joey,,,,,
" I can’t tell you that, no.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I’ll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn’t see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks up a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again. Here, I’ll slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow motion)",Joey,,,,,
" Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.",Joey,,,,,
" Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....",Joey,,,,,
" I don’t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin’ ‘em around...",Joey,,,,,
 Chandler!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.,Joey,,,,,
" No, only for s*x.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!,Joey,,,,,
" (angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!",Joey,,,,,
 Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him),Joey,,,,,
 I just got off the phone with my sister.,Joey,,,,,
 Mary-Angela.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Why don’t you ask Chandler, ‘cause he’s the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin’ over Janice by groping my sister.",Joey,,,,,
" Really? That’s great! You and my sister, sittin’ in a tree.",Joey,,,,,
 Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?,Joey,,,,,
" You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, ‘cause my Grandma doesn’t know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.",Joey,,,,,
 She’s right in there. (motions to the living room),Joey,,,,,
 What’s goin’ on?,Joey,,,,,
" What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’d be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!",Joey,,,,,
" No! No! No! No, I’m not going to punch Chandler.",Joey,,,,,
" No you won’t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he’s sorry. But, (to Chandler) you’ve got one more apology to make, all right, you’ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.",Joey,,,,,
 All right.,Joey,,,,,
" Cookie, now you can punch him!",Joey,,,,,
" All right, that’s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks Rachel) But, is he a big guy?",Joey,,,,,
 (hanging up the phone) Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?,Joey,,,,,
" It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 Who?,Joey,,,,,
 The what?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, okay. (to Ross) The what?",Joey,,,,,
" (singing) You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, (picks a handkerchief from the pianist's pocket) you've got to pick a pocket or two..........",Joey,,,,,
 Really? Thanks.,Joey,,,,,
" Excellent, I'll be there.",Joey,,,,,
" Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I can dance, y'know. (starts to dance really, really, really badly)",Joey,,,,,
" Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.",Joey,,,,,
 Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.,Joey,,,,,
" Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?",Joey,,,,,
 (reading) The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...,Joey,,,,,
" Whoa, I'm not done.",Joey,,,,,
 Done.,Joey,,,,,
 Mark's a genius!,Joey,,,,,
" And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, (sadly) 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'",Joey,,,,,
" So, does that mean the audition is off?",Joey,,,,,
 What?!,Joey,,,,,
" It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.",Joey,,,,,
 Bye. (does the jazz hands),Joey,,,,,
" I know, it was the best I could get out of them.",Joey,,,,,
" People, people, people.",Joey,,,,,
 (to Phoebe) Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?,Joey,,,,,
 Cool.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you’ll probably be hungry after the s*x.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Check the freezer. If there’s none in there, then we’re probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It’s late.",Joey,,,,,
 I discovered I’m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.",Joey,,,,,
 Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again?,Joey,,,,,
" The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it’s way better than that classic of yours.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, you got it.",Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
" Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.",Joey,,,,,
" How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?",Joey,,,,,
 These little women. Wow!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo’s manuscript. I don’t see how he could ever forgive her.,Joey,,,,,
 But Jo’s got a crush on Laurie. (Ross nods his head) Oh. You mean it’s like a girl-girl thing? ‘Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.,Joey,,,,,
 No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.,Joey,,,,,
" (noticing Chandler) What are you doing? (he pushes Chandler back to his side of the couch) Get back over on your side of the... (sees Robert in all his glory) Hello!! (to Robert) Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! (starts to laugh.) How’s it going?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?",Joey,,,,,
" Oooh, the next part’s the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...",Joey,,,,,
 All right I’ll talk in code. (to Ross and Chandler) Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.",Joey,,,,,
" Beth, Beth dies?",Joey,,,,,
 Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?,Joey,,,,,
 Then why would you say that?!,Joey,,,,,
" Beth is really, really sick.",Joey,,,,,
" Jo’s there, but I don’t think there’s anything she could do.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 (nodding his head) Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 Wow! This girl is good.,Joey,,,,,
" (to Leslie) So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.",Joey,,,,,
" (to Leslie) Ah, anything we might of heard of?",Joey,,,,,
" (to Phoebe) Wow, that was kinda brutal.",Joey,,,,,
" Ah, he can’t make it, he said he had to his... (sees Ginger) Whoa-oh! (hides behind the coat rack.)",Joey,,,,,
" Phew, close one.",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Is ah, is Chandler around?",Joey,,,,,
 Oooh.,Joey,,,,,
" Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn’t something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?",Joey,,,,,
" Aww, man. That’s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he’s my roommate, she’s gonna tell him what I did.",Joey,,,,,
" What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can’t, I can’t tell you that, it’s like the most awful, horrible thing I’ve ever done my whole life.",Joey,,,,,
" All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad’s cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....",Joey,,,,,
" I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.",Joey,,,,,
" I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.",Joey,,,,,
 I ran!!,Joey,,,,,
 (entering from his bedroom) Morning.,Joey,,,,,
 (to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin’ huh?,Joey,,,,,
" Listen, I ah, I know it’s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. You okay?,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Where have you been?,Joey,,,,,
" (to Monica) Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?",Joey,,,,,
 Done.,Joey,,,,,
 So Pheebs what’s this guy like?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
" Uh, y'know what, we’re having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we’ll need a little more time to think about it.",Joey,,,,,
 Both of us? (points to Chandler and himself),Joey,,,,,
 We’ll be there.,Joey,,,,,
" Uh, 10:30.",Joey,,,,,
 4:30.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?",Joey,,,,,
 She was kidding about that right?,Joey,,,,,
" God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?",Joey,,,,,
" Dude, I don’t know.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don’t want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don’t want to be seeing.",Joey,,,,,
" Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... (clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I guess, but what’s like heads and what’s tails?",Joey,,,,,
 So what are you gonna do?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.",Joey,,,,,
" Nothing, he’s just really believes in that.",Joey,,,,,
 (Voice Over) Previously on Friends.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?",Joey,,,,,
" Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about the trail?",Joey,,,,,
 (stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! (slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?",Joey,,,,,
 Don’t answer that.,Joey,,,,,
 Awful! Horrible!,Joey,,,,,

One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you’ve got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship, (smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I’m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you’ll be long gone. But I won’t have aged at all.

 Yeah. What are we getting?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?",Joey,,,,,

" (voice-over) ...and he couldn’t let it go, and... I don’t really know what happened with that either. ",Joey,,,,,

" Well, there’s really only one thing you can do.",Joey,,,,,
 You’re gonna have to pee on it.,Joey,,,,,
" Don’t blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.",Joey,,,,,
 If you want some privacy you can use my hole.,Joey,,,,,
 Me too.,Joey,,,,,
 No?,Joey,,,,,

 I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...,Joey,,,,,
" That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn’t. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.",Joey,,,,,
 (laughs) That’s ‘cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.,Joey,,,,,
" How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.",Joey,,,,,
" Look, we’re not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!",Joey,,,,,

" Looks good, uh?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!",Joey,,,,,
 What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh. What do you do?,Joey,,,,,

" This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.",Joey,,,,,

" (looking through a deck of cards) Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!",Joey,,,,,
" Dude, you don’t have to brag! We got nothing here!!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. (Goes back into the hall),Joey,,,,,

" Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit. (The duck comes to the door of the bathroom, quacking.) (To the duck) In a minute. (The duck goes back into the bathroom.)",Joey,,,,,
" Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’.",Joey,,,,,
" How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?",Joey,,,,,
" You wanna see what I got? (He gets up to empty out his pockets) Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!",Joey,,,,,
" And a 50. (The salesman stops suddenly) Huh, these must be Chandler’s pants.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I-I think I’m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.",Joey,,,,,
 Wh-what’s going on?,Joey,,,,,
 No he doesn’t!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?",Joey,,,,,
" Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?",Joey,,,,,
 I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.,Joey,,,,,
" All right that’s it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the door.)",Joey,,,,,
" Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you’re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.",Joey,,,,,
" Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.",Joey,,,,,
 I have actually not heard of that.,Joey,,,,,
" Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know! (He storms out, and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an ‘Oops!’ have.)",Joey,,,,,
" Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he’d better come up here and apologize. I’ll see you later. (Starts to leave)",Joey,,,,,
" He said that he wasn’t gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he’s gonna do is have you evicted—I’ll see you later.",Joey,,,,,
 Well he made Rachel cry!,Joey,,,,,
" All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns around) I mean I’ll have to check with him first, but I’ll think he’ll be cool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)",Joey,,,,,
" Please don’t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn’t there fault, it was mine.",Joey,,,,,
" No you can’t do that, where would the chick and the duck live?",Joey,,,,,
" Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I’m the chick and Chandler is the duck.",Joey,,,,,
" Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I’ll do whatever you want.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah-yeah, absolutely.",Joey,,,,,
" What, what is it?",Joey,,,,,
" That’s not, prison lingo, is it?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, there’s this superintendent’s dance, the Super Ball. I don’t know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he’s a crush on.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, he’s too shy, he doesn’t thing he’s good enough to dance with girls yet.",Joey,,,,,
" Aww, man, now we won’t be bank buddies!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I’m doing something exciting and I don’t wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y’know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!",Joey,,,,,
" No-no, thank you.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, I’m here, let’s ahh, get this over with.",Joey,,,,,
" Whoa-whoa, don’t we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?",Joey,,,,,
" No, it’s okay, but if I’m Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.",Joey,,,,,
" Come on man, you’re not a potato.",Joey,,,,,
" Come on Treeger, don’t say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again. Come on. (they start dancing again) Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y’know, I’m not really that comfortable dancing with a—(Treeger throws him) We-he!! Hey!",Joey,,,,,
" Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time. (He walks into the kitchen and does a little dance step on the way.)",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 No I didn’t.,Joey,,,,,
" No, I’m not! And it wasn’t a hop it was a pademarie.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, well maybe I’m enjoying it a little bit. I mean I’m getting pretty good at it.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey, hold on, this isn’t some kind of like girly dance. All right, it’s like a sport, it’s manly!",Joey,,,,,
 All right.,Joey,,,,,
 I don’t know how to lead.,Joey,,,,,
 What?!,Joey,,,,,
" (To Mr. Treeger) So you ah, ready for our last practice?",Joey,,,,,
" Look, you wanna use our place?",Joey,,,,,
 We did it!!,Joey,,,,,
" I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh well, okay, good luck.",Joey,,,,,
 Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?,Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 Go get ‘em Treeger.,Joey,,,,,
 (intrigued) Really?,Joey,,,,,
" No, I’m good.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?",Joey,,,,,
 Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey guys. (to Chandler) Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?",Joey,,,,,
 It's 4:30.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, I see what's going on here.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! You don't like Kathy.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?",Joey,,,,,
" Good, and hey! My treat. (He turns to go into his bedroom then stops.) But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?",Joey,,,,,
 Is she great or what?,Joey,,,,,
 (to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?,Joey,,,,,
 Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.,Joey,,,,,
" I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.",Joey,,,,,
" Well then, do it better!",Joey,,,,,
" Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.",Joey,,,,,
" (opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board over the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV) Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Why?,Joey,,,,,
 You can pee here!,Joey,,,,,
" We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I know...",Joey,,,,,
" (entering the apartment) Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.",Joey,,,,,
 It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?,Joey,,,,,
 Why not?,Joey,,,,,
" Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... ""Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!""",Joey,,,,,
 She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.,Joey,,,,,
" (whining and heading toward the door) Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...",Joey,,,,,
" Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?",Joey,,,,,
 Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.,Joey,,,,,
" So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?",Joey,,,,,
" All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.",Joey,,,,,
 What kind of smell?,Joey,,,,,
" All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?",Joey,,,,,
" You wanna see her again, right?",Joey,,,,,
 So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
" All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! (Ross hesitates, looks unsure) Oink!",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!,Joey,,,,,
" Our place, the hall! I...",Joey,,,,,
 (Unimpressed) A book? (Suddenly interested) Is it like a book that's also a safe?,Joey,,,,,
" You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. (Joey leaves, comes back in.) Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?",Joey,,,,,
 Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" You know, uh... [Joey moves the pen case out onto the counter.] Chandler got you a gift, too.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!",Joey,,,,,
 Ah. Hm. (To Kathy) Wanna go to bed?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. (Tries to strike a sexy pose up against the doorway to his room. Then goes inside).",Joey,,,,,
" (opening bedroom door) Hey, that coupon expires, you know.",Joey,,,,,
" Great! All right, so I’ll call you later.",Joey,,,,,
 That would be Casey. We’re going out tonight.,Joey,,,,,
" No, things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! (Laughs),Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?,Joey,,,,,
 What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive.,Joey,,,,,
 You got all that from the back of her head?,Joey,,,,,
 Who’s Elaine?,Joey,,,,,
" (on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, it’s me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.",Joey,,,,,
" We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I’ll be there as soon as I can.",Joey,,,,,
" ‘Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to—(he stops talking suddenly)",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
" Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more—(his time runs out for real)",Joey,,,,,
" (on phone) Hey dude, it’s me.",Joey,,,,,
" Listen uh, I’m really sorry, it looks like I’m gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn’t there!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, it must’ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.",Joey,,,,,
" Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.",Joey,,,,,
 Aww man! I can’t believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the door.),Joey,,,,,
 (rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?,Joey,,,,,
 Why?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, you’re amazing.",Joey,,,,,
" (very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That’s the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I’m gonna do that.",Joey,,,,,
" No-no-no, I think I’m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She’s pretty cool.",Joey,,,,,
" No-no, Kathy.",Joey,,,,,
" No. No, Kathy.",Joey,,,,,
 Y’know what I think? I think somebody’s got a little crush on Casey. How ‘bout I fix you two up? What do you think?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! Samboucha Margarita?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.",Joey,,,,,
 What’s up?,Joey,,,,,
 You do?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better. She’s not my girlfriend anymore.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, she broke up with me.",Joey,,,,,
" Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that’s why I let people watch.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I’ve been better. But, I’m all right. So you like her huh?",Joey,,,,,
" No-no-no, no it’s uh, it’s okay.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you can to me first.,Joey,,,,,
" But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you’re work cut out for you. ‘Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she’s into some other guy. So…",Joey,,,,,
 Who?,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 And what?! Did you sleep with her?!,Joey,,,,,
 What?!! That’s even worse!!,Joey,,,,,
 I don’t know! But it’s the same!,Joey,,,,,
 Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!,Joey,,,,,
" Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!",Joey,,,,,
" Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like ""Well, kinda."") Well, y’know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I’m not gonna eat! You know why?!",Joey,,,,,
" Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I’m not happy about you either. (The bread maker dings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom and slams the door.)",Joey,,,,,
 (answering phone) Hello.,Joey,,,,,
 (answering phone) Hello.,Joey,,,,,
 (answering phone) Stop callin’!!,Joey,,,,,
 All right!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.,Joey,,,,,
 No! I’m putting that in my room.,Joey,,,,,
" Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?",Joey,,,,,
 Five years.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.,Joey,,,,,
" No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don’t know why you’re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there’s a spot open.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 All right. But if you weren’t my best friend.,Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?",Joey,,,,,
 (Something in Italian.) (Storms out.),Joey,,,,,
 My folks.,Joey,,,,,
 I don’t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I…",Joey,,,,,
" Look, it’s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t know what it is to be a friend. So, I’ll see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler grabs his bag and stops him.)",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! You did! And that’s why I’m leaving.,Joey,,,,,
" When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much! See you around!",Joey,,,,,
 We’ve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.),Joey,,,,,
 (coming out of the bathroom) What’s twisted?,Joey,,,,,
 Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!,Joey,,,,,
 He’s fine!,Joey,,,,,
 Chandler?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 He’s doin’ some thinkin’!,Joey,,,,,
 You kissed my girlfriend!,Joey,,,,,
 That doesn’t sound like thinking to me!,Joey,,,,,
 Y’know I don’t think you should be talking at all in there! I think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!,Joey,,,,,
" All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn’t mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box!",Joey,,,,,
 So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?,Joey,,,,,
 That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? (There’s no response from Chandler.) Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 I’ll get it. (It’s Kathy.),Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 That’s okay. Chandler’s the one I’m mad at.,Joey,,,,,
 In the box.,Joey,,,,,
 (starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.),Joey,,,,,
" He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get out of there!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, we’re gonna be fine! Get out!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, you did some real good thinkin’ in there.",Joey,,,,,
 Now go! ‘Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you’re secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.),Joey,,,,,
" All right, who got Chandler? ‘Cause I uh, need to trade.",Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, that’s not them. I’m gonna go call the police.",Joey,,,,,
 I think I know that girl.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, I definitely know her.",Joey,,,,,
" Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, why do you call him Gandolf?",Joey,,,,,
" No, I had s*x in high school.",Joey,,,,,
" Will you calm down, he’s just a human guy.",Joey,,,,,
 Really?!,Joey,,,,,
" All right, I’ll see you guys.",Joey,,,,,
" I have an audition, but I’ll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?",Joey,,,,,
 Okay. (leaves as the phone rings),Joey,,,,,
 Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you’d be out partying with Gandel-worf.,Joey,,,,,
 So you’ve been sittin’ around here all mornin’?,Joey,,,,,
 So what if he didn’t come! We can still go out and party ourselves!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, we could do that!",Joey,,,,,
" We’ll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! All right? Let’s go!,Joey,,,,,
" All right, so we’ll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we’ll head back out.",Joey,,,,,
" So, we’re having fun, right?",Joey,,,,,
" We don’t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we’ll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.",Joey,,,,,
 Are you serious?!,Joey,,,,,
 Thank God! I’m exhausted!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, but uh, I don’t want to be up too late, so uh, I’ll have a decaf.",Joey,,,,,
" I can’t hear a word you’re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I know.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.,Joey,,,,,
" We’re 29, we’re not women.",Joey,,,,,
" Done! I did it! Heh, who’s stupid now? (He smiles and has cookie remains all over his teeth.)",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas.",Joey,,,,,
 Ohhh!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?",Joey,,,,,
 Good enough to get fired.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?,Joey,,,,,
 What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.,Joey,,,,,
 Sure! Where are the seats?,Joey,,,,,
" Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, what are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 (checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work),Joey,,,,,
 (entering from the dining room) Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, what happened to your fancy chef’s jacket? (sees there’s a burn spot on it)",Joey,,,,,
" You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happens to be over her breast.)",Joey,,,,,
 It’s still a tiny bit on fire there.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",Joey,,,,,
 (opening an envelope) There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks in this one!,Joey,,,,,
 No ma’am.,Joey,,,,,
" I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, ""Wow! It’s been a long time since I had… (tries to do the math in his head, but can’t) 327 + 238 dollars!""",Joey,,,,,
" And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nice things I’ve been saying about you.",Joey,,,,,
" Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.",Joey,,,,,
 (interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Y’know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!,Joey,,,,,
" You bet I do! I just ah, wasn’t listening then, that’s all.",Joey,,,,,
 What are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?,Joey,,,,,
 Well I guess I should’ve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!,Joey,,,,,
 Yep! Looks like it’s gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.,Joey,,,,,
 (leaving) Lean-lean-lean!,Joey,,,,,
 Check it out! Check it out! Guess what job I got? [smoothes the blue blazer he's wearing and has a big grin on his face],Joey,,,,,
" Oh, tour guide at the Museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.",Joey,,,,,
" No, not really. They give you all the information. It's like memorizing a script. [demonstrates] ""And on your left, you have Tyrannsoarus rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.""",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, but I can pronounce ""Jurassic"".",Joey,,,,,
 [disgustedly] You're really thinking of having s*x with your brother?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh.,Joey,,,,,
" Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.",Joey,,,,,
" [gesturing to what I'm presuming is the Mastadon] Okay, now the Mastadon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.",Joey,,,,,
" [looks nervous] Shhhh. This is a museum. No talking. [moves group along and gestures to a three legged foot] Okay, now right down here we have, uh... a large foot.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, moving right along. [moves group away] Come on.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, uh, would you mind sitting here? [gesturing across from him] I'm saving this seat for my friend Ross.",Joey,,,,,
 Doctor? I didn't know he had a nickname.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, uh, how come?",Joey,,,,,
 That's crazy.,Joey,,,,,
" I, I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables but Ross is one of my best friends. If I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it.",Joey,,,,,
" Ross, Ross, over here man. [gestures beside him] I saved you a seat.",Joey,,,,,
" It's no big deal you know. You do what you gotta do, right?",Joey,,,,,
 [looks at him for a second and then gets up to throw his garbage away.] Whatever.,Joey,,,,,
" Look, Ross, really, it's no big deal. You know, you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then, so be it. I understand. When I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So, you know, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow. [leaves]",Joey,,,,,
" [gets up, tray in hand, and walks to the middle table] I will sit with you Dr. Geller. [he puts his tray down on the table and Ross and Joey shake hands.]",Joey,,,,,
" [stands up, whips coat off and throws it on the floor vehemently] I'm Joey. I'm an actor. I don't know squat about dinosaurs.",Joey,,,,,
 You hang in there Ted!,Joey,,,,,
 It’s the chick! She’s…going through some changes.,Joey,,,,,
 Good luck. (to Monica) And I’m still right!,Joey,,,,,
 She’s mad because I know today’s her laundry day and that means she’s wearing her old lady underpants.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, what’s that about?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?",Joey,,,,,
 Six.,Joey,,,,,
" All right, we’ll start with…apples.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, the last thing…",Joey,,,,,
" No-no, not for like another two weeks.",Joey,,,,,
 Serious?,Joey,,,,,
" No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?",Joey,,,,,
 Huh.,Joey,,,,,
 I know.,Joey,,,,,
 Animals dressed as humans.,Joey,,,,,
 (to Chandler) The Irish gig guy?!,Joey,,,,,
 It’s All Relative.,Joey,,,,,
 (to Chandler) Nana?,Joey,,,,,
 (answering the question) Althea!,Joey,,,,,
 I took a shot.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, no way, that rooster’s family!",Joey,,,,,
 What do you have against the duck?! He doesn’t make any noise!,Joey,,,,,
" Look, we are not gonna…",Joey,,,,,
 (shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.),Joey,,,,,
 Oooooh!,Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 Big fat goalie.,Joey,,,,,
 Weekend at Bernie’s.,Joey,,,,,
 Everyday use.,Joey,,,,,
 Guest.,Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, 11!",Joey,,,,,
 I call Monica’s room!,Joey,,,,,
" Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I’m sight of the room and I called it.",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey—ooh Pheebs, are they in there?",Joey,,,,,
 Oh wow! You can tell this soon.,Joey,,,,,
 What?!,Joey,,,,,
" You can’t just ignore the bet! It’s a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!",Joey,,,,,
 But it is our apartment!,Joey,,,,,
 Did you see the size of the closets?!,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.),Joey,,,,,
 (Holding a turkey leg) There’s gravy?,Joey,,,,,
 I think I left a donut up here.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 (to Ross) That-that is a good trick.,Joey,,,,,
" Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them.",Joey,,,,,
 Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?",Joey,,,,,
" Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.",Joey,,,,,
" Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?",Joey,,,,,
 Noooo!!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?,Joey,,,,,
 Yep! Grab a plate.,Joey,,,,,
" No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin’ closer.",Joey,,,,,
" Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, who’s playing?",Joey,,,,,
" All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!",Joey,,,,,
" I don’t know, it smells good.",Joey,,,,,
 (Holding a magazine) Wow! The new Playboy!,Joey,,,,,
 Come here.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah, totally! That’s such a turn-on!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, ""Hey, how you doin’?""",Joey,,,,,
" (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin’?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!",Joey,,,,,
" Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?",Joey,,,,,
 What the heck is that?,Joey,,,,,
" No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!",Joey,,,,,
" Dude, tell me she actually told you this.",Joey,,,,,
" Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, for next time, what do you say?",Joey,,,,,
 What’s ready?,Joey,,,,,
" I don’t know, it looks the same.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 How’d it go?,Joey,,,,,
 Guggly worm.,Joey,,,,,
 Glow-pop giggly jammer.,Joey,,,,,
" (examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops the sandwich)",Joey,,,,,
" (going over and picking up the rod) That’s all right. Hey you guys, you know what’s going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, ""Joey, what are you doing with your life?"" stuff. I can say, ""Well, I’m doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?""",Joey,,,,,
" Look, there’s nothing I can do for him right now, he’s still in his sweat pants, that’s still Phase One. Y'know? I’ll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.",Joey,,,,,
 Gettin’ drunk and going to a strip club.,Joey,,,,,
" Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey-hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh my God, you guys have no idea.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how’s he doing?",Joey,,,,,
 (goes over to Chandler) Hey buddy! How’s it going?,Joey,,,,,
" (To the rest of the gang) Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I’ve got to go memorise my lines. (Starts to go his bedroom) Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!",Joey,,,,,
 (running from his bedroom) Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!,Joey,,,,,
" Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have time! They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.",Joey,,,,,
 (rushing in) Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I’m here! I’m here!,Joey,,,,,
" Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!",Joey,,,,,
" (trying to act like he’s not the one that stinks.) Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?",Joey,,,,,
" Y’know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?",Joey,,,,,
" No-no, it’s uh, it’s Heston.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.",Joey,,,,,
" Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?",Joey,,,,,
 Interesting.,Joey,,,,,
 How ya doin’?,Joey,,,,,
" I guess you wouldn’t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?",Joey,,,,,
" No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I’m an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I’m doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah-yeah, I’m one of the cops that won’t work with you ‘cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I’m really sorry, but I stink!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh no-no-no, you don’t understand…",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, yeah.",Joey,,,,,
" Yes sir! Yes sir, I’m-I’m—(he starts to leave)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. Oh, yeah.",Joey,,,,,
 I don’t wanna.,Joey,,,,,
 I wanted to go to the strip club!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, all right. (Ross enters.)",Joey,,,,,
" Ohh, Nothing.",Joey,,,,,
 I know what it did! Nothing.,Joey,,,,,
 Like this. (Shrugs),Joey,,,,,
 Sure! It flushes it.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! (Sees Janice.) Ah!! (Janice screams in surprise.),Joey,,,,,
 And there it is.,Joey,,,,,
 So what are you doing bringing her here?! There’s people here!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. (They all look around and then back at Joey.) I’m tellin’ ya!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! What’s up?,Joey,,,,,
 (to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.,Joey,,,,,
" Dude, you’re not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey, what’s going on?",Joey,,,,,
 Thanks for telling me!,Joey,,,,,
" Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.",Joey,,,,,
" Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I can’t believe you said you’d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!",Joey,,,,,
" (pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That’s called a scrum, okay? It’s kinda like a huddle.",Joey,,,,,
 Ross! (Laughs) They’re gonna kill you!,Joey,,,,,
" All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It’s not like he’s…Chandler!",Joey,,,,,
" Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy (Points). And that one—Dude! They’re all huge!",Joey,,,,,
" Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.",Joey,,,,,
 I totally don’t know what you’re talking about.,Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
" Dude, if you go back out there, you’re gonna be Dead Ross!",Joey,,,,,
 The Red Ross! Okay.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, sure.",Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, look, your eye’s still popping out a little, I’m gonna go get some ice.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
 Is it the shampoo? It’s guava.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh! Wait-wait! (Reaches inside the shower.) Is it my bologna sandwich?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, wait-wait! (Reaches into the shower again.) Maybe it’s a pickle?!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, what have you guys been up too?",Joey,,,,,
 Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey that’s what all my relationships are like.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, what’ going on?",Joey,,,,,
 Awwww!,Joey,,,,,
 What-what-what is so funny?,Joey,,,,,
 Now that’s a thinker.,Joey,,,,,
 A little salami.,Joey,,,,,
 Pastrami.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. (He goes over to her.),Joey,,,,,
" Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.",Joey,,,,,
 There was a seen in Footloose...,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl…",Joey,,,,,
" What? Were you like in the movie, or… Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.",Joey,,,,,
 Welcome to America. (They both kiss.),Joey,,,,,
" If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party?",Joey,,,,,
" Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!",Joey,,,,,
" All right look, y’know how-y’know how when you’re dating someone and you don’t want to cheat on them, unless it’s with someone really hot?",Joey,,,,,
" All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you’re going to do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!",Joey,,,,,
 Feel better now?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I eat a lot of meat right?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you’d just be eating my animals.",Joey,,,,,
" Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)",Joey,,,,,
 (trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.,Joey,,,,,
" Oooh, what you got there?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y’know what goes good with that?",Joey,,,,,
" Hm-mm, corn beef.",Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that’s much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?",Joey,,,,,
 (He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?,Joey,,,,,
" Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?",Joey,,,,,
 (coming in from his bedroom) What is that?,Joey,,,,,
 Maybe he found you flip-flop.,Joey,,,,,
 Whoa! Is this p0rn? What did I do? I must’ve hit something on the remote.,Joey,,,,,
" No, we didn’t even pay our cable bill—maybe this is how they punish us.",Joey,,,,,
 Maybe we shouldn’t pay our gas bill? (Stops and thinks about what he just said.),Joey,,,,,
 (to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.),Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!",Joey,,,,,
" Imagine a protective p0rn bubble if you will, okay?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 Pheebs! You’re blocking the p0rn! Look out!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah right.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, he likes p0rn.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!",Joey,,,,,
 You play hard to get.,Joey,,,,,
 Then you go to Tokyo.,Joey,,,,,
" Way to be strong, man!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. ‘Cause you already told her you love her and she didn’t say it back, then she called you and told you that there’s another guy, so yeah, go to London that’ll scare her!",Joey,,,,,
" Ross! Ross! If you’re going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars? (Chandler nods his head no.)",Joey,,,,,
" (pause) Nothing. No, nothing.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!",Joey,,,,,
 Noo! Nothing!,Joey,,,,,
 I think you’re right.,Joey,,,,,
 One.,Joey,,,,,
 That’s kinda nice.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!!,Joey,,,,,
" Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey’s your pal. Joey’s your buddy. ""Where is everybody?"" ""Well, they’re hanging out with Joey.""",Joey,,,,,
" Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he’ll be there.",Joey,,,,,
 What do ya say? What do ya say?,Joey,,,,,
 I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" No, but I’m gonna!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.",Joey,,,,,
 Someone you didn’t make up!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, that guy really hurt us.",Joey,,,,,
" All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name; it’s barely even a word. Okay? It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not! All right? It’s a stupid, stupid non-name!",Joey,,,,,
" I’m sorry man, I didn’t—I’m-I’m sorry. I’m sorry. (Goes over and comforts him.)",Joey,,,,,
 So I guess it’s Joey then!,Joey,,,,,
" (answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings them inside.)",Joey,,,,,
" Dude, I am sorry about what I said!",Joey,,,,,
 It’s not that bad.,Joey,,,,,
" So, you’re just Bing?",Joey,,,,,
 No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.,Joey,,,,,
" See you later, Gene.",Joey,,,,,
 What’s up with Gene?,Joey,,,,,
" Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.",Joey,,,,,
 Ohh! (Realises it was all a trick to get Phoebe to name the baby Chandler.),Joey,,,,,
 Are you kidding? I love that guy! (Starts singing) Morning’s here! Morning is here—,Joey,,,,,
" See, this is a great apartment.",Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.",Joey,,,,,
 You have Knicks tickets?,Joey,,,,,
 (examining the tickets) Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 You’re not stupid. You’re meaner than I thought.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, you do!",Joey,,,,,
 Come on!,Joey,,,,,
" Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh come—look, when I was a kid my dad’s company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn’t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 We don’t make enough fun of you already?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" All right look, Ross, he’s right. Emily’s great, she’s great! But this way too soon, you’re only gonna scare her!",Joey,,,,,
" No! You don’t want to wreck it, you don’t want to go to fast!",Joey,,,,,
" Wait-wait-wait-wait! (To Chandler) Come on! Come on, let’s trade! The timing’s perfect, I just clogged the toilet!",Joey,,,,,
" Yes! Didn’t you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn’t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!",Joey,,,,,
 It’s the Knicks!,Joey,,,,,
 Whoa!,Joey,,,,,
 Huh.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, the Knicks rule all!",Joey,,,,,
 Done!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh.,Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, we could end up with nothing.",Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, I like that.",Joey,,,,,
" Come on man, you know I’d do it for you! Because, you’re my best friend.",Joey,,,,,
 All right!,Joey,,,,,
 Okay!,Joey,,,,,
 What’s the game?! What’s the game?!,Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, they’re tall.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! Okay. (Joey picks a card.) Phoebe, you look, I can’t.",Joey,,,,,
 Okay. Okay. (He looks at the card.) Ace!,Joey,,,,,
" What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!",Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
" Uh-huh, not as high as…(picks a card) It worked! King!",Joey,,,,,
 Why?!,Joey,,,,,
" Seriously, good game though. Good game. (He tries to congratulate them, but they pull away.) (To Chandler) What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y’know, kinda like a peace offering.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.) (Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!",Joey,,,,,
 I don’t know.,Joey,,,,,
 I don’t want to move again!,Joey,,,,,
 That was one good minute!,Joey,,,,,
 Good night.,Joey,,,,,
 Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at him.),Joey,,,,,
 Hey! (Singing) Get into gear!,Joey,,,,,
 (happily) Okay!,Joey,,,,,
" (joining in, in his sleep) Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!",Joey,,,,,
" (proudly) Oh, you should here me.",Joey,,,,,
" Look, I told ya, I’m not going to any clinic! I don’t have a problem, you’re the one with the problem! You should go to a ""Quit being a baby and leave me alone"" clinic!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you’ve just had your first class!",Joey,,,,,
" Ohhh, yeah!",Joey,,,,,
" I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.",Joey,,,,,
 That’s not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!,Joey,,,,,
 You can’t do anything!,Joey,,,,,
 This sucks! I didn’t know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I’m so tired!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, well…",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.",Joey,,,,,
 I am… (Looks in his date book.) free!,Joey,,,,,
 (still looking in date book) Hey! That’s the day after I stop menstruating! (They all look at him.) This isn’t mine.,Joey,,,,,
 Joey Tribbiani.,Joey,,,,,
" (sleepily) Yeah, she is. Wow! (Falls back asleep, loudly) How you doin’?",Joey,,,,,
 What?!,Joey,,,,,
 (asleep) So why don’t you give me your number?,Joey,,,,,
 (muffled by the mouth guard) Hey you guys! What’s happening?,Joey,,,,,
" (muffled) Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it’s gonna help me not to snore.",Joey,,,,,
 (takes out the mouth guard) I know I don’t have too! It tastes good. (Puts it back in.),Joey,,,,,
" (muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am trying to sleep! (Shrugs to say, ""What’s up with that?"")",Joey,,,,,
 I know. Ross is getting married.,Joey,,,,,
 Everybody’s doing stuff!,Joey,,,,,
 (snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!,Joey,,,,,
" No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 We’re gonna climb Mt. Everest!,Joey,,,,,
 We could get that Everest video though.,Joey,,,,,
" And while we’re down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! (Chandler’s excited.) Oh, y’know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah we are!,Joey,,,,,
 It's never gonna happen.,Joey,,,,,
 Don’t answer that.,Joey,,,,,
 Awful! Horrible!,Joey,,,,,
 She was nothing compared to you.,Joey,,,,,
 Ewwwww!,Joey,,,,,
" (taking apart the invitation) Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You’re at the wedding, you have to cry, ""Handkerchief?"" ""No-no, I got my invitation.""",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Don’t worry man, I get to bring a guest. We’ll show him.",Joey,,,,,
" I knew that! (They all look at him) I sooo didn’t know that, but you should see your faces.",Joey,,,,,
 Heyyy. (They all try and hide their invitations.),Joey,,,,,
" He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.",Joey,,,,,
 Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.,Joey,,,,,
 It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!,Joey,,,,,
" I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!",Joey,,,,,
 Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don’t you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?",Joey,,,,,
 What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!,Joey,,,,,
" Come on Ross! Look, I-I don’t have any brothers; I’ll never get to be a best man!",Joey,,,,,
 (pause) I’ll never get to be a best man!,Joey,,,,,
 (impatiently tapping Chandler on the shoulder) What about me?! You-you just said I could!,Joey,,,,,
 I can’t believe you’re not picking me.,Joey,,,,,
 Yes! (to Chandler) Shame about you man.,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?,Joey,,,,,
 (grabs it) Thanks.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, we’re having a big party tomorrow night. Later! (Starts for the door.)",Joey,,,,,
" Nooo, later. (Walks out the door.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, it’s Ross’s bachelor party.",Joey,,,,,
 Are you bachelors?,Joey,,,,,
 Are you strippers?,Joey,,,,,
 Then you’re not invited. (Starts for the door again.),Joey,,,,,
" Oh-whoa, what party?",Joey,,,,,
" Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don’t want to do! Later! (Finally, he makes his exit.)",Joey,,,,,
" This is what I’ve got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I’ve got you, me, and Chandler and I’m gonna invite Gunther ‘cause, well, we’ve been talking about this pretty loud.",Joey,,,,,
" All right—oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I’d really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.",Joey,,,,,
 Okay! We’ll need a six-pack of Zima.,Joey,,,,,
 You got it.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, there’s gonna be strippers there. He didn’t say anything about no strippers.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I chose not to hear that.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don’t-don’t forget your shirt. (He gives Gunther his shirt and Gunther leaves.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, little party favours, check it out! (It’s a shirt that reads, ""Ross Geller, Bachelor Bash 1998"")",Joey,,,,,
" Oh-oh! (Shows him what’s on the back, ""Best Man Joey Tribbiani, with a huge picture of him.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, hey, don’t forget your shirt.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, hey, museum geeks, party’s over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent’s basement. All right. (The museum geeks exit and Joey unlocks his door and lets the chick and the duck out.) Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. (The duck complies.) Hardly move. (The duck complies.) Be white. (The duck complies.),Joey,,,,,
" Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin’ ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday…",Joey,,,,,
" Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. I’ll let you play with my duck.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, (realises he doesn’t know her name.) stripper! (He notices that the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees it’s empty and starts to panic.)",Joey,,,,,
" (running and banging on Chandler’s door) The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!",Joey,,,,,
 The ring is gone!,Joey,,,,,
" Dude, this isn’t funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything’s cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is gone!",Joey,,,,,
 Of course!! (Shrugs.),Joey,,,,,
" Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey…,Joey,,,,,
" So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!",Joey,,,,,
" I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those…",Joey,,,,,
" (laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it.",Joey,,,,,
" Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they’re gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.",Joey,,,,,
" I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number. They said, ""If I bothered them again they’d call the police."" I said, ""If you talk to the police, you tell them I’m missing a ring!""",Joey,,,,,
" Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I…",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, that sounds like fun, but we’ve got a ring to find!!",Joey,,,,,
" All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I’ll be uh, Mr. Wong.",Joey,,,,,
" There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!",Joey,,,,,
" I don’t get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn’t take it, and I didn’t take it; and you (Chandler) didn’t take it, then who did? (The duck quacks.) Shh! We’re trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at the same moment and stare at Joey, who doesn’t get it. After a short pause, with the duck still quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)",Joey,,,,,
 If anything should happen to him…,Joey,,,,,
 So! Things can go wrong! You don’t know! What if he doesn’t make it?!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, but what if he doesn’t? He’s such a good duck.",Joey,,,,,
" I’m so worried about him, y’know?",Joey,,,,,
 H-h-h-how’s the duck?,Joey,,,,,
" Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.",Joey,,,,,
" No, it’s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, it is! You wouldn’t have lost the ring, right? Y’know what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.",Joey,,,,,
" Now, don’t argue with me…",Joey,,,,,
 Really?,Joey,,,,,
 (starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so that they can’t see him cry.),Joey,,,,,
" It’s all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less than enthused Chandler and starts towards the girls’ apartment.)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don’t want to lose that.",Joey,,,,,
 Ohh!! (Runs to his room.),Joey,,,,,
 Woo-hoo!!,Joey,,,,,
 London baby!,Joey,,,,,
 (louder) London baby!!,Joey,,,,,
" Bye, Pheebs!",Joey,,,,,
" London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)",Joey,,,,,
 Come on! Do something!,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his ""pop-up"" map of London. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)",Joey,,,,,
" It’s London, baby! All right, the hotel’s here. (Points to the map.) Wait. No, we wanna go… No. I know. (Sets the map down.) I’m gonna have to go into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)",Joey,,,,,
 I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.,Joey,,,,,
" Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)",Joey,,,,,
" All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I’ve ever seen. Hey! (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?",Joey,,,,,
 Really? To what?,Joey,,,,,
" Man, you are Westminster Crabby. (He starts chasing Chandler towards the Abbey.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on the front of it.) Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I embarrass you?",Joey,,,,,
 Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If you’re gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.,Joey,,,,,
 Thanks.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!,Joey,,,,,
 Me too.,Joey,,,,,
" Noo!! I’ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!",Joey,,,,,
 Sh-shh-shh! (He motions for her to watch something he has taped.),Joey,,,,,
" (on tape) Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.",Joey,,,,,
" (on tape) Oh, Chandler.",Joey,,,,,
 That’s Fergie baby!!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I’m in my map and-and…(Ross enters) Hey!",Joey,,,,,
 Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.),Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didn’t think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!",Joey,,,,,
" (on phone) Hey, Pheebs! It’s Joey!",Joey,,,,,
" That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?",Joey,,,,,
" Kinda, but I’ve just been having way too much fun.",Joey,,,,,
" No, I don’t think so.",Joey,,,,,
 Who’s seven?,Joey,,,,,
" Ahh, the babies miss me?",Joey,,,,,
 What? You ordered pizza without me?!,Joey,,,,,
 Two pizzas?!,Joey,,,,,
" Wait, well, where did you get it from?!",Joey,,,,,
 What’s in it?,Joey,,,,,
" (Looking up at the waiter)That’s not food...No, I don’t, no...(Taps Chandler on the shoulder.) Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can’t even remember what Phoebe looks like.",Joey,,,,,
 (Pointing  at Chandler.) Your different here too. Your mean in England. (Chandler throws his hands up to his head in frustration. They walk away from each other.),Joey,,,,,
" Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I’m not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. (pointing at everyone.) But not as much as I love America. (Looking at Chandler.) Could we please..go home now?",Joey,,,,,
" (Putting his arm around her.) I’m not going anywhere, sweetheart.",Joey,,,,,
 Hello?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...,Joey,,,,,
" Ahh Pheebs, you know you’re still my number one girl.",Joey,,,,,
 Ohh great!!!,Joey,,,,,
" (Confused.) But, he loves Emily?",Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 Hold on. Hold on. (Picking up a note pad and writing and reading the message aloud.) Rachel coming. Do...Something.,Joey,,,,,
 Right!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 Have you seen Monica?,Joey,,,,,
 (With a confused look on his face.) What?,Joey,,,,,
 Look we’ve got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel’s coming to tell Ross she loves him!!,Joey,,,,,
 I know! That’s why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?,Joey,,,,,
" (Whispering.) Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I’ll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.",Joey,,,,,
 Okay. (They both walk off to watch for Rachel.),Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Felicity.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 (In a New York accent.) Fuggetaboutit. (She giggles.) How you doin?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah.",Joey,,,,,
 (Smiling.) Ohh great!! (Putting the phone to his ear.) Hello. (He begins to escort her down the aisle.),Joey,,,,,
" No, but it’s okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.",Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
" Ah, I’m-I’m walking down the aisle...Still walking. (Mrs. Waltham takes her place.) I’m about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. (Looking at the bridesmaid.) Hey! (Talking to Phoebe.) I told her ""Hey."" And now I’m at the front with Ross. It’s Phoebe. (He shows Ross the phone.) He looks pretty mad. Uh...I’d better go.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, that went well. Yeah.",Joey,,,,,
" (To the gang) Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, what’s up? (He has solved the problem of eating the steak, he’s eating it with his hands.)",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I figured we’re in another country, so it doesn’t count.",Joey,,,,,
" (approaching) Ross, hey, the band’s ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so…",Joey,,,,,
 You spit on me man! (Wipes his face.),Joey,,,,,
" Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!",Joey,,,,,
" No you don’t, I just saw you go in there with Monica!",Joey,,,,,
" Look, which one of us is gonna be having s*x in there, me or you?",Joey,,,,,
 My Giant? I love that movie!,Joey,,,,,
 Can I ask you something?,Joey,,,,,
" Felicity and I, we’re watching My Giant, and I was thinking, ""I’m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant."" Do you think I’m just wasting my life with this acting thing?",Joey,,,,,
" I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I’ll ever get there?",Joey,,,,,
 Thanks man.,Joey,,,,,
 But what about how much taller he is than me?,Joey,,,,,
" I mean, there’s no way I can make myself taller now, y’know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Monica, wow you’ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.",Joey,,,,,
" Had the beef-tips, huh?",Joey,,,,,
 Hi!,Joey,,,,,
" All right, I’m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.",Joey,,,,,
" Why would you need to say hi to them, you’ve been feeding them for four days?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!",Joey,,,,,
" Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?",Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?,Joey,,,,,
 All right!,Joey,,,,,
 Mornin' Pheebs!,Joey,,,,,
 (interrupting) Was his name Angus? (Monica and Chandler laugh.),Joey,,,,,
" Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh…",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Ross, Bodington's!",Joey,,,,,
 That was good beer.,Joey,,,,,
" Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.",Joey,,,,,
 Later! (Exits.),Joey,,,,,
 (To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.,Joey,,,,,
 Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.),Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Pheebs!",Joey,,,,,
 (Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!,Joey,,,,,
 (Poking his head out.) Havin' some trouble?,Joey,,,,,
 I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.,Joey,,,,,
 (In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal.,Joey,,,,,
" Uh, okay, Pheebs?",Joey,,,,,
" Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?",Joey,,,,,
" All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, all of us! All day!",Joey,,,,,
 Phoebe!,Joey,,,,,
 Mine!,Joey,,,,,
" Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.",Joey,,,,,
" Which, is the new plan!",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This (His video camera) is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?",Joey,,,,,
 I gotta get the before shot!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh! (In an announcer type voice) And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee! (He grabs his side and doubles over in pain.)",Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, something hurts!",Joey,,,,,
 Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh my!,Joey,,,,,
 Not in my head.,Joey,,,,,
 (in a sexy voice) Yep! There's always room for Jell-O…,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, (snaps his fingers and in a sexy voice) Grandma's chicken salad…",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the USA Today and hands Ross the camera.) Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies… (Throws the paper away to reveal a copy of Playpen, which is the TV version of Playboy Magazine.) Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff. (Joey opens the magazine and Ross sticks the camera in it.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I was bummed too.",Joey,,,,,
 I think Saturday--(groans in pain again).,Joey,,,,,
" (entering from the elevator caring gifts for the kids) Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. (He doubles over in pain in front an old man in a wheel chair.) Get up! Get up! Get up! (The old man waves him away.)",Joey,,,,,
" Umm, well, what else could it be?",Joey,,,,,
 Or?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.",Joey,,,,,
" (interrupting) Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option--what's a urethra? (Monica whispers what it is in his ear.) Are you crazy?!",Joey,,,,,
" Ohh, get these things out of me!",Joey,,,,,
" I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs! (He starts rocking back and forth, taking Ross with him.)",Joey,,,,,
 Argh!,Joey,,,,,
 Argh!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh my God.,Joey,,,,,
 They're so small! (Both he and Ross look at them with satisfied looks on their faces.),Joey,,,,,
" Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!",Joey,,,,,
 (to Monica and Rachel) He's talking to London!,Joey,,,,,
" Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.",Joey,,,,,
 Ross! Way to suck up to the family.,Joey,,,,,
" (entering, wearing a tux) Hey!",Joey,,,,,
" Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!",Joey,,,,,
" A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!",Joey,,,,,
" Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs?",Joey,,,,,
" I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.",Joey,,,,,
" Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!",Joey,,,,,
" Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?",Joey,,,,,
" It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, may I ask for one example?",Joey,,,,,
 That's because all people are selfish.,Joey,,,,,
" Are you calling you people? (Chandler rolls his eyes.) Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?",Joey,,,,,
 That he doesn't exist.,Joey,,,,,
 (To the pledge volunteers) How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!,Joey,,,,,
" That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.",Joey,,,,,
 But I'm the host!,Joey,,,,,
" You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.",Joey,,,,,
 (on phone) Hey Mon!,Joey,,,,,
" See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (He waves his hand in front of the woman next to him and you can now see his arm on TV.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hello New York! (The woman bats his hand out of the way.),Joey,,,,,
 (in a bored voice) PBS telethon.,Joey,,,,,
 What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?,Joey,,,,,
" Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?",Joey,,,,,
 Come on man! You've been here all day!,Joey,,,,,
 (in an unenthusiastic voice) PBS Telethon.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey Pheebs!,Joey,,,,,
" $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?",Joey,,,,,
 And you don't a little good about donating the money?,Joey,,,,,
" A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.",Joey,,,,,
 Monica? What time is it?,Joey,,,,,
 But it's dark out.,Joey,,,,,
 I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. (He goes into the bathroom.),Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Doesn’t seem like it's going to work, I mean…",Joey,,,,,
 Hi!,Joey,,,,,
" So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.",Joey,,,,,
" (holding a box) Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.",Joey,,,,,
 You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, you're back!",Joey,,,,,
 How was your conference?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, you're back too!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, how was your chef thing?",Joey,,,,,
 (sticking his head out the door) What are you guys woofing about?,Joey,,,,,
" Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!",Joey,,,,,
 You want my advice?,Joey,,,,,
 You're not gonna like it.,Joey,,,,,
 You got married to fast.,Joey,,,,,
 I told ya.,Joey,,,,,
" Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.",Joey,,,,,
" Hi, Rach.",Joey,,,,,
" I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there. (Points over his shoulder.)",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, you're not Kip!",Joey,,,,,
 Who cares? You're Rachel! (To Chandler) Who's Kip?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, that poor b*st*rd.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.",Joey,,,,,
 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.,Joey,,,,,
" Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. (Pause.) Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) (He clears his throat to get their attention.) Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.",Joey,,,,,
 (shocked) Oh! Ohh! Oh!!,Joey,,,,,
 Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!,Joey,,,,,
 Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!,Joey,,,,,
 (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!,Joey,,,,,
 How?! When?!,Joey,,,,,
 IN LONDON!!!,Joey,,,,,
 But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!,Joey,,,,,
" All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but…",Joey,,,,,
" Aww, I don't want to see that!",Joey,,,,,
 I guess I'm done.,Joey,,,,,
 I think I'm gonna take-off.,Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!",Joey,,,,,
" Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! (Starts for his room.) And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.",Joey,,,,,
 (from the bedroom) I can hear that!,Joey,,,,,
 I can still hear you!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Argh-argh!! (Catches the coat.) Ooh, soft. Is this mink?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?",Joey,,,,,
" (after Ross is gone) What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?",Joey,,,,,
" No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!",Joey,,,,,
" No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.",Joey,,,,,
 I'll take it!,Joey,,,,,
" Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! (He drapes it around his shoulders.) Enh? All right, what do you think?",Joey,,,,,
 What's the matter Ross?,Joey,,,,,
 That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! (Phoebe pinches him.) Which is great! I love to ride that rail!,Joey,,,,,
" Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? (Phoebe pinches him again.) Ow!! He's not even here!!!",Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, you fogged Danny.",Joey,,,,,
" Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.",Joey,,,,,
" Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing (The shutters that close off the kitchen.) and it kinda knocked me out a little?",Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?",Joey,,,,,
" You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!",Joey,,,,,
" It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally-(The gang enters behind Joey and Phoebe pinches him again.)-Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.",Joey,,,,,
 We all hate Emily!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!,Joey,,,,,
 I kinda feel like it's my fault.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! (He glares at Chandler.)",Joey,,,,,
" Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.",Joey,,,,,
" Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. (Makes like he's juggling.) Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone…",Joey,,,,,
 (thinks) I'm not sure.,Joey,,,,,
 RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!,Joey,,,,,
" All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor…",Joey,,,,,
 It's almost as if he knew.,Joey,,,,,
" Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!",Joey,,,,,
 I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.,Joey,,,,,
" You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. (He stands up and turns his back to them so that he is facing the window.) Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. (The camera cuts to Ross outside hanging up the phone.) Smile! (Ross turns around and sees Joey alternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads back inside.)",Joey,,,,,
 What happened? What happened?,Joey,,,,,
" No, look. (Shows him the magazine.)",Joey,,,,,
" I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.",Joey,,,,,
 Why?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 Ross?,Joey,,,,,
" Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't—I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, all right!",Joey,,,,,
" (To Chandler) You're fake laughing too, right?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 Nothing.,Joey,,,,,
 (smiles) Kinda.,Joey,,,,,
" Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.",Joey,,,,,
" Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!",Joey,,,,,
 Sorry.,Joey,,,,,
 Ahhhhhhhhhh…,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?,Joey,,,,,
" No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!",Joey,,,,,
" All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this? (Imitates Ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps his hands as if he's waving good-bye.)",Joey,,,,,
" No, the quiet down thing!",Joey,,,,,
" Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been p0rn?",Joey,,,,,
" All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.",Joey,,,,,
 YES!!,Joey,,,,,
 Um-hmm.,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!,Joey,,,,,
" Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!",Joey,,,,,
" Umm, yum!",Joey,,,,,
 Mine! (He grabs it.),Joey,,,,,
 Oh that's mine too! (Grabs it and Ross looks at him.) I'm Italian!,Joey,,,,,
 But it's available now! Isn't it?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, let's go look at it! (They both jump up.)",Joey,,,,,
 Okay!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
" Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.",Joey,,,,,
" But hey, Ross, this place is available now!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, it's perfect!",Joey,,,,,
 He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! (Pause.) You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?,Joey,,,,,
" Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 I don't know. Maybe pizza?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh! Oh!,Joey,,,,,
" Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.",Joey,,,,,
" (getting up) Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! (He tries to take a step and falls flat on his face.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 You're kidding!,Joey,,,,,
" But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!",Joey,,,,,
" Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there (Points to where the window is but sees that there isn't any space there and points towards his door.) by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!",Joey,,,,,
 Definitely!,Joey,,,,,
 All right!,Joey,,,,,
" Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!",Joey,,,,,
 I need something sweet.,Joey,,,,,
" Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs. (Note: Actually, I think every guy is thankful for thongs. That and spandex. J )",Joey,,,,,
" I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!",Joey,,,,,
" Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, it's not like it sounds.",Joey,,,,,
 (muffled) Hello?,Joey,,,,,
 Phoebe?,Joey,,,,,
 Look. (He walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.),Joey,,,,,
 I know! It's stuck!!!,Joey,,,,,
 I put it on to scare Chandler!,Joey,,,,,
" Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.",Joey,,,,,
 It's Joey.,Joey,,,,,
 I can't! It-it's stuck!,Joey,,,,,
 Sorry! Sorry.,Joey,,,,,
" (pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!",Joey,,,,,
" (turning all the way around, and still not facing Chandler) Yeah, you are! (Starts dancing.) I scared you!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, ""Butternut squash?"" And it came out, ""Squatternut buash?""",Joey,,,,,
 You're a dork.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, they're mine.",Joey,,,,,
" I don't know uhh… (Pause as he thinks about it.) Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.",Joey,,,,,
 (reluctantly taking them) Chandler? A word.,Joey,,,,,
" That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! (Realizes he still has the underwear in his hand.) Ahh! (Throws them towards Chandler's room.) And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! (To Monica) Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and (He puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his pants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't…",Joey,,,,,
" Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the s*x makes it easier!",Joey,,,,,
" All right! But, (To Monica) you do it with me once.",Joey,,,,,
 Didn't think so.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Pheebs!",Joey,,,,,
 What's wrong buddy?,Joey,,,,,
 I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.,Joey,,,,,
" So you uh, still wondering?",Joey,,,,,
 You're smart. I like that.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!",Joey,,,,,
 Hiya.,Joey,,,,,
" I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. (Points at Chandler, angrily.)",Joey,,,,,
" You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!",Joey,,,,,
" All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. (Starts for his room.) Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!",Joey,,,,,
 Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!,Joey,,,,,
 No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just… I just… Kinda…,Joey,,,,,
 Thank you!,Joey,,,,,
 What?!! (He turns around and stares at Chandler who's silently pleading with Joey to go along with it.) No I'm not!!,Joey,,,,,
 No! No! I am not a s*x addict!,Joey,,,,,
" No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!",Joey,,,,,
 (thinking) I slept with Monica.,Joey,,,,,
" Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.",Joey,,,,,
 Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?,Joey,,,,,
 Ahh—oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?,Joey,,,,,
" No! If anyone's a s*x addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!",Joey,,,,,
 That makes sense!,Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, Monica?",Joey,,,,,
 But sadly I could not be enticed.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. (Offers it to everyone.)",Joey,,,,,
 What are you doing?,Joey,,,,,
 Why are you doing this?,Joey,,,,,
" Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You’ve got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven’t you ever been unemployed?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, don’t get religious on me, ok. (Ross looks a little confused.) A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here…sit down. (Ross sits down.) Ready? (Joey flips the foot rest up.) Ahh!! (He reclines the chair fully.) Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!",Joey,,,,,
" Ohh, no, no. We’re not going to just sit. (Joey sits down and hits the speed dial button on the phone.) Shhh. (It begins to ring.)",Joey,,,,,
 (In a high pitched female voice) Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.,Joey,,,,,
" But, I love you.",Joey,,,,,
 And that’s Wednesday. (He reclines in his chair.) Ohh.,Joey,,,,,
" So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?",Joey,,,,,
 How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.,Joey,,,,,
 She’s a woman!,Joey,,,,,
" (Very discouraged) Okay, is there anything else?",Joey,,,,,
 That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!,Joey,,,,,
" Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?",Joey,,,,,
" Wait a second, I could star in it!",Joey,,,,,
" I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.",Joey,,,,,
 Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!,Joey,,,,,
 Thanks!,Joey,,,,,
 Done!,Joey,,,,,
 It's not.,Joey,,,,,
 (disappointed) Oh.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, how do you spell suspicious?",Joey,,,,,
 Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.,Joey,,,,,
 You're driving me crazy with that!,Joey,,,,,
 Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.",Joey,,,,,
" Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.",Joey,,,,,
" (jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?",Joey,,,,,
" All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh yeah, right here. (He punches his fist through the wall next to the door.)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.",Joey,,,,,
" You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 (To Chandler) I didn't finish my five pages.,Joey,,,,,
 Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.,Joey,,,,,
" Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.",Joey,,,,,
" Come on look guys, don't fight.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.",Joey,,,,,
 Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.",Joey,,,,,
 They're brother and sister!!!,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!,Joey,,,,,
" No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. (Reading.) ""It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out."" Ross (Points to him.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.",Joey,,,,,
" A handsome man enters. (Playing the part of the handsome man.) Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, (Ross) you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you (Chandler) well you co-created Fireball. The end.",Joey,,,,,
" No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. (Takes out a bowling ball and a propane torch.) Ha-ha!",Joey,,,,,
" (Reading the scene set up.) Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.",Joey,,,,,
 What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!,Joey,,,,,
 All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!,Joey,,,,,
 What's the matter?!,Joey,,,,,
" All right, I'll take care of it.",Joey,,,,,
" Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?",Joey,,,,,
" Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.",Joey,,,,,
 Chandler.,Joey,,,,,
" Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, great!",Joey,,,,,
 Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!,Joey,,,,,
" Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.",Joey,,,,,
" So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 So did that do anything for ya?,Joey,,,,,
" All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.",Joey,,,,,
 Really? Who-who have you taught?,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!,Joey,,,,,
" Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?",Joey,,,,,
 You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! (Chandler is straining to keep quiet as Phoebe enters.),Joey,,,,,
" See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.",Joey,,,,,
" Umm, okay.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. (Holds up his hand in one of Phoebe's chords.)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and…",Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
 Yes!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! (Chandler bangs the table in frustration.),Joey,,,,,
 You look like a freak.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. (Does a chord and Monica starts taking pictures of him and Phoebe. They both start to strike a pose with the excessive amount of pictures that Monica takes.)",Joey,,,,,
" Yes! Yes, I did.",Joey,,,,,
 (thinks) (quietly) G-sharp.,Joey,,,,,
 What?! I didn't touch a guitar!,Joey,,,,,
" No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! (Notices Monica standing between them and smiling.) What?! (The camera clicks, taking another picture.)",Joey,,,,,
" Your other student, was you!",Joey,,,,,
" (looking in the Yellow Pages) Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!! (Storms out.)",Joey,,,,,
 (answering phone) Hello?,Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, Chandler's not here.",Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 Nice!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?",Joey,,,,,
" Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.",Joey,,,,,
" Umm, do you see any—oh, Vaseline?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.",Joey,,,,,
 Ross? You okay?,Joey,,,,,
" Really?! Uhh, what color is it?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!",Joey,,,,,
" (To Ross) Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out. (He hangs up the phone and strands Ross in the bathroom.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.",Joey,,,,,
" What-what is it, what is it?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!",Joey,,,,,
" I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!",Joey,,,,,
 And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!,Joey,,,,,
 I'm not listening to you!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Pheebs?",Joey,,,,,
" Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. (After a short pause she hands him her guitar.) You really think I'm ready?",Joey,,,,,
" Wow! Cool! (He takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note. However, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table and lands on the floor. Phoebe just stares at the guitar.)",Joey,,,,,
 (sitting back down) Was the chord at least right…,Joey,,,,,
 Howdy partner!,Joey,,,,,
 Umm?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, no! (Starts that screaming thing again. Rachel stops him by pulling his fingers out of his ears.)",Joey,,,,,
" Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!",Joey,,,,,
 Now? You want me to go over there now?,Joey,,,,,
 Do you know something?,Joey,,,,,
 I might know something.,Joey,,,,,
 What's the thing you know?,Joey,,,,,
 I can't tell you what I know.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, fine.",Joey,,,,,
 You don't know!,Joey,,,,,
 (gasps) YOU KNOW!!!!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I know!!!!",Joey,,,,,
" Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen… (Phoebe returns and interrupts them.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.",Joey,,,,,
" Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.",Joey,,,,,
 Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.,Joey,,,,,
 (thinks) I don't know.,Joey,,,,,
 I don't know.,Joey,,,,,
 (thinks) I don't know.,Joey,,,,,
" Ohh, I know one thing!",Joey,,,,,
 They did it right there on the couch.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey Ross!,Joey,,,,,
 (eyeing the flattened scone) Anybody gonna eat that?,Joey,,,,,
 (entering from his room) All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?,Joey,,,,,
 Really?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, let's go Pheebs.",Joey,,,,,
 Maybe we should check the trash chute.,Joey,,,,,
" That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.",Joey,,,,,
 (snaps his fingers) He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.,Joey,,,,,
 He hooked up!! Tell us about her!,Joey,,,,,
" All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.",Joey,,,,,
 Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!,Joey,,,,,
 Damnit Phoebe!!,Joey,,,,,
" All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?",Joey,,,,,
" All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)",Joey,,,,,
" Judge rules, no violation.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 What?!,Joey,,,,,
 And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!,Joey,,,,,
" Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.",Joey,,,,,
" Umm, hi.",Joey,,,,,
" Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.",Joey,,,,,
" Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! (He picks a hat up from the floor. It's one of those magician stovepipe hats.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.",Joey,,,,,
" Great! Thanks, Rach!",Joey,,,,,
 All right.,Joey,,,,,
 Are you all right?,Joey,,,,,
 Pheebs! Sorry!,Joey,,,,,
" Pheebs, I'm so sorry.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.",Joey,,,,,
 Really? A purse?,Joey,,,,,
 It looks like a women's purse.,Joey,,,,,
" See look, women, carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder and looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.",Joey,,,,,
 Maybe you need s*x. I had s*x a couple days ago.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, but sandwich time is right now. (Removes a sandwich and starts eating.)",Joey,,,,,
 Why would I return it? I love this bag!,Joey,,,,,
 Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? (He's holding the fake credit cards that come with the bag.),Joey,,,,,
" All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.",Joey,,,,,
 U-N-I-sexy? (Smiles provocatively.),Joey,,,,,
" Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.",Joey,,,,,
" Here, I brought you some flowers. (He pulls them out of the bag.)",Joey,,,,,
" (approaches, wearing his glasses) Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. (Moves his hand towards and away from his face.) It's like it's coming right at me. (Chandler helps out a little bit by pushing on Joey's arm, which causes his hand to slap him in his face.)",Joey,,,,,
 What did you say to him?,Joey,,,,,
" (entering, with bag) Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?",Joey,,,,,
" Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, (pats the bag) comes with a bag! (Exits.)",Joey,,,,,
" (reading from the script) Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, sure. (He takes it off and starts reading.) Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should—I'm sorry, can I ask you something? (He stops and asks a question.)",Joey,,,,,
" Well, first it's not a purse.",Joey,,,,,
" I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!",Joey,,,,,
" All right look, let me show you the catalog! (Does so.) See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!",Joey,,,,,
" Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah but I didn’t read anything.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay! All right, I'll see ya. (As he's walking off stage.) (Patting the bag.) We got it! We got it!",Joey,,,,,
 (dejected) Hi.,Joey,,,,,
 Estelle said I didn't get it. (Sits down next to Rachel on the couch.),Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.",Joey,,,,,
" Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with the bag!",Joey,,,,,
 Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!,Joey,,,,,
" I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? (She's avoiding his eyes.) Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",Joey,,,,,
 I can't believe I'm hearing this!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey guys!,Joey,,,,,
 What? What?,Joey,,,,,
 You mean how they're friends and nothing more? (Glares at Rachel.),Joey,,,,,
" Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!",Joey,,,,,
" No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.",Joey,,,,,
 I can't take any…,Joey,,,,,
 Noo! I can't take any more secrets! (To Rachel) I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. (Joey shies away.)",Joey,,,,,
 Ugh.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
 Well I didn't tell them!,Joey,,,,,
" Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.",Joey,,,,,
 And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!,Joey,,,,,
" I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!",Joey,,,,,
 No! Not unless! Look this must end now!,Joey,,,,,
 I'm listening.,Joey,,,,,
 So he likes to break stuff.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.",Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
 They know you know.,Joey,,,,,
 I couldn't even if I wanted too.,Joey,,,,,
" (looking out the window) Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!",Joey,,,,,
 (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!,Joey,,,,,
 Ooh!,Joey,,,,,
" I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)",Joey,,,,,
 It's not my first time.,Joey,,,,,
 Dude!,Joey,,,,,
 All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!,Joey,,,,,
 (panicking) Dude! He's right there!,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? (Ross turns and glares at him.) Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.",Joey,,,,,
 (quickly) I call Godfather!,Joey,,,,,
" Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.",Joey,,,,,
" (to her) Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.",Joey,,,,,
" So, are you ready to go?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh sure, right back there. (Points.)",Joey,,,,,
 I was thinking Chinese food.,Joey,,,,,
" I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but…",Joey,,,,,
 (shyly) She keeps punching me.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? (Quietly) She-she-she's hurting me.",Joey,,,,,
" (sets the coffee down) Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.",Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.",Joey,,,,,
 No-no.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, big!",Joey,,,,,
" Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?",Joey,,,,,
" Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! Hiya!,Joey,,,,,
 Huh.,Joey,,,,,
 Uhh….,Joey,,,,,
 Nah.,Joey,,,,,
 What a bad idea!,Joey,,,,,
 She's right y'know.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.",Joey,,,,,
 That's not funny at all!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 What are you guys doing up?,Joey,,,,,
 (thinks) Dark red.,Joey,,,,,
" Aww, you guys are so cute!",Joey,,,,,
" All right, I'll see you in the morning.",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Hey, you guys!",Joey,,,,,
" (To Monica) Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?",Joey,,,,,
" Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I’m not him.",Joey,,,,,
 No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!,Joey,,,,,
" No! No, you smell like a meadow. (Pause.) I'm sorry. (Runs to the bathroom.)",Joey,,,,,
 (To Phoebe) Hey! (Sees that Monica's there.) Oh.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I didn’t know you guys were going to be here.",Joey,,,,,
 (backing away) What?! Why?!,Joey,,,,,
 Nothing!,Joey,,,,,
" All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don't want to talk about it. (Starts for his room.)",Joey,,,,,
" Well, it involved Monica.",Joey,,,,,
" Don't worry, there wasn't any s*x in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.",Joey,,,,,
 It-it doesn’t?,Joey,,,,,
 That kinda sounds like your dream dude.,Joey,,,,,
 In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.,Joey,,,,,
 (looks at her) Not really.,Joey,,,,,
" No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?",Joey,,,,,
 Friends first? That's interesting.,Joey,,,,,
" No, never done that either.",Joey,,,,,
 (in a sexy voice) How you doin'?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, (In a sexy voice) for you.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…",Joey,,,,,
" …is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, ""Who are my friends?"" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So…",Joey,,,,,
 I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.,Joey,,,,,
 I'll treat you real nice. (Pulls out a chair for her.),Joey,,,,,
 Won't-won't that take longer?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. I understand. I understand. (Pause) Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. (Starts for his room.)",Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, well, she's…really good in bed.",Joey,,,,,
" (To Rachel) Well look, hey, it's all your fault!",Joey,,,,,
" Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! (Pause) And her roommate!",Joey,,,,,
 Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!,Joey,,,,,
" (entering) All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!",Joey,,,,,
" (taking a bite) Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?",Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, just a minute officer!!",Joey,,,,,
" Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!",Joey,,,,,
" I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.",Joey,,,,,
" That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, (To Monica) same as the day before.",Joey,,,,,
" Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.",Joey,,,,,
" (waving) Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. (Notices that a woman is waving back.) Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. (She just stares at him.) (Joey sees how beautiful she is.) Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. (He turns back to the woman.) Okay, here goes. (Thinks.) How (Holds up his hand like an Indian) you (Points at her) a-doin'? (Does a little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. She smiles and waves again.) (To Monica) It worked! She's waving me over. (Towards the woman.) Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor…",Joey,,,,,
" Tell me about it, huh? (Realizes that she can see Monica.) Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! (He pantomimes that out.) Ewwuck! (He pushes Monica away and makes a disgusted face.)",Joey,,,,,
 This is your place?,Joey,,,,,
" But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! (Runs away.)",Joey,,,,,
 Ugh!!,Joey,,,,,
" I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. (Looks out the window.) Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit. (We see Ross sitting on the couch and flipping through the channels on his remote.)",Joey,,,,,
 Did you tell the guy you wanted to have s*x with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?,Joey,,,,,
 What happened?,Joey,,,,,
 You kissed him?!,Joey,,,,,
" I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! (Chandler makes a noise) No?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. (She hugs him and Joey looks out the window.) She's back! Hot girl's back!",Joey,,,,,
" No, in Ross's building! (He throws Rachel onto the chair and heads to the window.) She's back! She's back! (Pantomimes) Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. (He counts where she is again.) Got it! (Runs out and does a little hot over a chair.)",Joey,,,,,
 Damnit!! Did you move?!,Joey,,,,,
 (Looking around) Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. Sorry about that. (He walks away and knocks on the next door which is answered by a little girl.) Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?",Joey,,,,,
 Later! (He runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a whole other corridor.) Oh man! (Walks down the hallway in desperation.) Hot girl! Hot girl!!,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey guys! (Sees their state of undress) What 'cha been doin'? (Has a silly grin.),Joey,,,,,
" I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. (He looks out the window.) Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.",Joey,,,,,
" Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.",Joey,,,,,
" No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.",Joey,,,,,
 I did not know that! Thank you Monica. (Starts to leave) I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.,Joey,,,,,
 Dahhhhh!! (Ross has a puzzled look on his face.) No! Noooo!! (Storms off.),Joey,,,,,
" Okay, pick a card.",Joey,,,,,
" All right now, memorize it. (Pause) You got it?",Joey,,,,,
 (holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.),Joey,,,,,
" (reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! (Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! (Ross and Carol stare at him, then Joey realizes what he just said.) I mean, way to go Ben! (Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.) Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.",Joey,,,,,
 I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!,Joey,,,,,
 Luck!,Joey,,,,,
" Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.",Joey,,,,,
 Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!,Joey,,,,,
 Done.,Joey,,,,,
 They're gonna do it together.,Joey,,,,,
" What, so I gotta shut it down now?",Joey,,,,,
 Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?,Joey,,,,,
" Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.",Joey,,,,,
 What?! Are you kidding?!,Joey,,,,,
 All right!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!",Joey,,,,,
" I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her…",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad….",Joey,,,,,
" That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?",Joey,,,,,
 I look more like him than you do! (He winks at Carol.),Joey,,,,,
" (also downtrodden) Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.",Joey,,,,,
 (Happily) Yeah I did!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so…",Joey,,,,,
 Who knows?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!,Joey,,,,,
" Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey Pheebs! (To the guys) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.",Joey,,,,,
 That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!,Joey,,,,,
" I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!",Joey,,,,,
 What? Chandler! Tell 'em!,Joey,,,,,
 At least I care about his feelings!,Joey,,,,,
 Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!",Joey,,,,,
 You just give him a spoon baby!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?! So's yours!,Joey,,,,,
" Hmmm, soup! (Tries again.) Hmm soup! (Tries again, with a little caveman thrown in.) Hmm, soup!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, no problem.",Joey,,,,,
" (goes over to Ben) Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.",Joey,,,,,
 (angrily) Ross!,Joey,,,,,
 Hi!,Joey,,,,,
 Uh-oh.,Joey,,,,,
" Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, what did I say?",Joey,,,,,
 How's that different? (She looks at him until he gets it.) Oh! Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
" Hmm, noodle soup.",Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
" Hmm, soup. (Pause.) I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!",Joey,,,,,
" No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! (Eats another spoonful) Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! (Storms out.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah right! (Gets up for a refill to his snow cone.),Joey,,,,,
" Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, ""Hmm, noodle soup."" (Nods his head in disgust.)",Joey,,,,,
 What you do mean?,Joey,,,,,
" Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. (Thinks about it.) Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor…",Joey,,,,,
" No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.",Joey,,,,,
" Thank you! So, did-did he get it?",Joey,,,,,
" Eh, what are you gonna do?",Joey,,,,,
" (entering, with his grandmother) Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!",Joey,,,,,
" Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.",Joey,,,,,
" She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so…",Joey,,,,,
" Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.",Joey,,,,,
 (walking past) True story! (Goes and sits down.),Joey,,,,,
" Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! (They have two of the cops on the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.) Oh my God.",Joey,,,,,
" (smiling) Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.",Joey,,,,,
" (smiling) Oh, they cut me out of the show.",Joey,,,,,
 (smiling) Not likely.  'Cause you see that body bag right there,Joey,,,,,
 (smiling) I'm in it.,Joey,,,,,
" (smiling) I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.",Joey,,,,,
" (smiling) No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! (They all smile.)",Joey,,,,,
" Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! (Points to the screen, of course it isn't him.)",Joey,,,,,
" No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.",Joey,,,,,
" (To Ross in the kitchen) All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!",Joey,,,,,
" I know, I know! What am I going to do? (Thinks) Ooh!",Joey,,,,,
" (dejected) Yeah, all right. (Thinks of something.) Ooh! (He quickly runs out before anyone can stop him.)",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey! Is the show still on?,Joey,,,,,
 (says hi to his grandma) Look! Oh! (Pointing out the window.) Is that the Pope?! (Chandler and his grandma turn to look and Joey slips a tape into the VCR.),Joey,,,,,
" Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!",Joey,,,,,
 (on the tape) All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!,Joey,,,,,
 That's right!,Joey,,,,,
" (on the tape) Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. (The duck quacks, to the duck) Choo! Choo! Choo! (To the imaginary cops) Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it…(the duck quacks louder) Choo!! And if I don't get it, (pause, picks up the duck) I'm gonna shoot this duck!",Joey,,,,,
 (on the tape) I'm comin' out! (He opens the door and hops out pointing the gun in all directions and then runs out of view.),Joey,,,,,
" (to his grandmother) That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah, good idea.",Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, Ross, look! Look! (Points behind Ross.)",Joey,,,,,
 Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!,Joey,,,,,
 (to the rest of the gang) Somebody help me out here!,Joey,,,,,
 You got to go on a ride along?!,Joey,,,,,
 I want to go on a ride along!,Joey,,,,,
" (returning from a deli) Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh-ho, yeah!",Joey,,,,,
 Yep!,Joey,,,,,
 (dejected) Yeah okay. (To Chandler) Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, okay.",Joey,,,,,
 Did I say you could smell it?!,Joey,,,,,
 Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, imagine the best s*x you've ever had.",Joey,,,,,
 Are you thinking about Monica?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, what's that like?",Joey,,,,,
" Come on man! (To Gary) Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?",Joey,,,,,
 Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?",Joey,,,,,
 Is everything okay?,Joey,,,,,
 (To Ross) You okay man?,Joey,,,,,
 Hi.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I didn't know that.",Joey,,,,,
 Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!,Joey,,,,,
 Dude! How come you took off?,Joey,,,,,
 Is something wrong?,Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
" That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!",Joey,,,,,
 Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.,Joey,,,,,
" I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!",Joey,,,,,
" Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I…knew…you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!",Joey,,,,,
" Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.",Joey,,,,,
 I know it doesn't make much sense…,Joey,,,,,
" Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!",Joey,,,,,
" I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is (Goes and picks up the sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!",Joey,,,,,
 No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (He unwraps the sandwich and holds it out for Chandler) here.",Joey,,,,,
" No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!",Joey,,,,,
 How good is that?,Joey,,,,,
 See?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. With a bite! (Takes back the sandwich.) Gee-e-e-eez!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, hero sandwiches. (Points at Ross who points back.)",Joey,,,,,
" Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?",Joey,,,,,
 Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, what time is it?",Joey,,,,,
" Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks his pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 What the hell is that?!!,Joey,,,,,
" That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}",Joey,,,,,
 It's not a cat!,Joey,,,,,
 It's not a cat!,Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, the ball thing.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!",Joey,,,,,
 Okay!,Joey,,,,,
 (catches the ball) Uh-oh.,Joey,,,,,
 I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!,Joey,,,,,
" Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!",Joey,,,,,
 Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.,Joey,,,,,
 Hi!,Joey,,,,,
 I don't know.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I don't know…. Yeah, can't do it.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, we haven't dropped it in… (Looks to Ross.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.",Joey,,,,,
 That's right baby.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, that's right!",Joey,,,,,
" Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!",Joey,,,,,
 I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We (Ross and him) invented this game!,Joey,,,,,
 Did you get your money back?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh hey, here Pheebs. (He throws her the ball.)",Joey,,,,,
 Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?,Joey,,,,,
" Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.",Joey,,,,,
" Me too! Me too! Me too! (Yeah, he does the same thing.)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I got too excited!",Joey,,,,,
" (entering, depressed) Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. (Pause, then very excitedly) I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!",Joey,,,,,
" It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears… But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, ""Where's Betsy?"" Right? And she says, ""Betsy's been dead for 10 years.""",Joey,,,,,
" And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! (To Chandler) And you know what that means buddy!",Joey,,,,,
" Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!",Joey,,,,,
 All right! Thanks Pheebs!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh umm, not go.",Joey,,,,,
" I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?",Joey,,,,,
 Great! Problem solved!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, back to square one.",Joey,,,,,
 (quickly) Yes!,Joey,,,,,
 Peanut butter!,Joey,,,,,
 A swimmer!,Joey,,,,,
" Monica. Oh… huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.",Joey,,,,,
 Ascot!,Joey,,,,,
 North route!,Joey,,,,,
" Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey man, what's up?",Joey,,,,,
" Sure, what do you want to see?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!",Joey,,,,,
" I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?",Joey,,,,,
 What do you like better action or comedy?,Joey,,,,,
 Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! You ready to go?,Joey,,,,,
" Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!",Joey,,,,,
" Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.",Joey,,,,,
" Did you not hear the plot of the movie? ""She's been dead for ten years."" I'm gonna be a millionaire!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 You got it!,Joey,,,,,
 Bye-bye!,Joey,,,,,
 Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?,Joey,,,,,
 See ya! (Walks out.),Joey,,,,,
" Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.",Joey,,,,,
" Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quickly looks at the road.) I think I just need lunch.",Joey,,,,,
 You wanna eat? (Pulls out the twenty) My treat!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?,Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?",Joey,,,,,
" Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?",Joey,,,,,
 Is this movie gonna be my big break?,Joey,,,,,
 (shocked) What?!,Joey,,,,,
" Dude you said, ""No!""",Joey,,,,,
 You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?,Joey,,,,,
 I don't believe this!,Joey,,,,,
 What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!,Joey,,,,,
 Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.,Joey,,,,,
" Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.",Joey,,,,,
 Not if you're gonna be like this!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!,Joey,,,,,
" Fine! (He slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the sound of numerous car horns.) Get out!",Joey,,,,,
 Get out!!,Joey,,,,,
 (on a pay phone holding a box) Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!,Joey,,,,,
 Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.,Joey,,,,,
 Wh-what?! Why?!,Joey,,,,,
 (laughs) You're kidding right?,Joey,,,,,
 What?!,Joey,,,,,
" Uh, hang out?! How long?",Joey,,,,,
 No!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Thanks. (The grip walks away.) (Reading the card.) Congratulations on your big break.,Joey,,,,,
" (on phone from Vegas) Hey Monica, it's Joey!",Joey,,,,,
" Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!",Joey,,,,,
 (to the family) Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.,Joey,,,,,
" Everybody smile! (The picture is taken) Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! (The family leaves.) Kill me. Kill me now.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.",Joey,,,,,
 That's it! Thanks Pheebs!,Joey,,,,,
 No! (She nods no to Chandler) Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!,Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.",Joey,,,,,
" Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?",Joey,,,,,
 Don't come out here!,Joey,,,,,
 I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, Entertainment Tonight. [Cut to Chandler] Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right. (Hangs up the phone and poses for that picture.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hi!,Joey,,,,,
 What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.,Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. (To no one in particular) Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.",Joey,,,,,
" They uh director. Uhh, her. (Points to an old woman standing behind him. Who glares at him and walks off.) All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.",Joey,,,,,
" Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. (To Chandler) I'm sorry man.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, what-what's going on?",Joey,,,,,
 Dawson?!,Joey,,,,,
" Aww, there we go.",Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, so close.",Joey,,,,,
 Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here! (Walks away.),Joey,,,,,
" Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right…",Joey,,,,,
" All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!",Joey,,,,,
" Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!",Joey,,,,,
 Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!,Joey,,,,,
 (to the dealer) Can I change a hundred? (He hands him his chip.),Joey,,,,,
 (betting all 100) Let's ride.,Joey,,,,,
" Hit me! (He does so.) Ohh man! (Joey busts and loses all the money, but when the dealer starts to collect the cards Joey notices something.) Wait! (He holds his hand next to the dealer's hand.)",Joey,,,,,
 Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!,Joey,,,,,
 My identical hand twin!,Joey,,,,,
" What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!",Joey,,,,,
 Don’t you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!,Joey,,,,,
" Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!",Joey,,,,,
" This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand (Holds up his left hand) twice? Huh?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, are you unsupporting me again?",Joey,,,,,
 Pheebs!!,Joey,,,,,
 I found my identical hand twin!,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey-hey-hey you made it!,Joey,,,,,
 All right! Hey-hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Who's your friend? He's hot! (Ross laughs and Rachel smacks him with her purse.),Joey,,,,,
" No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!",Joey,,,,,
 My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!,Joey,,,,,
" Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?",Joey,,,,,
" He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. (Holds up his hand.) See?",Joey,,,,,
" Okay! (Walks away, then turns back.) How you doin'?",Joey,,,,,
 Right! Okay. (Heads for the bathroom.),Joey,,,,,
" Oh-oh-oh, yeah! (He grabs some towels and takes them to him.) That's right, you take good care of those babies!",Joey,,,,,
" It's me, Joey!",Joey,,,,,
 (holds up his hand) Joey!,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!",Joey,,,,,
" Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!",Joey,,,,,
" (stopping him) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! (Singing, to the tune of This Land is Your Land) This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!",Joey,,,,,
 (following him) But you haven't even heard the chorus!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Hi!,Joey,,,,,
" Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! (He starts to leave, but gets an idea and stops.) Hey Rach, how you doin'?",Joey,,,,,
" Ross, don't let her drink anymore! (Exits)",Joey,,,,,
 (sitting down) Ahhh! (Slides his hands across the table.),Joey,,,,,
" No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway… (Shakes his hands.)",Joey,,,,,
" (throws down a small wad of money, and as his hand twin starts to unfold it, Joey once again brings attention to their special gift to the world. {Y'know, looking at it now, they really don't have that similar of hands. Joey's are bigger.}) Ooh-ho-ho! (The dealer stares at him and he stops.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hit me! (He does so.),Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?",Joey,,,,,
" Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?",Joey,,,,,
" Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! (Being dragged out by the guard) I'm your hand twin!!",Joey,,,,,
 (entering with Phoebe) Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn’t that why you guys are here?,Joey,,,,,
 Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?,Joey,,,,,
" Mornin’ Pheebs. (Sits down.) Well, my movie has officially been canceled.",Joey,,,,,
" Nah, I’m too depressed to eat. I’ll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I’ll just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight?",Joey,,,,,
 I don’t need that anymore.,Joey,,,,,
" I don’t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. (Gets an idea.) Oh—ooh! How about you come with me?",Joey,,,,,
" It’ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.",Joey,,,,,
 Sure?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 Where is the waitress?! I’m starving!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, here’s where I win all my money back! (Gets up and heads for the buffet table with Chandler in tow.)",Joey,,,,,
 Sure! What’s up? (He grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a huge pile of scrambled eggs. Chandler just stares at him and Joey reluctantly gives him a spoonful.),Joey,,,,,
" Oh my God! That’s huge! (Hugs him.) Wait a minute, why come I wasn’t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don’t say, ""Ross."" Do not say, ""Ross.""",Joey,,,,,
 Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material.,Joey,,,,,
" Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she’s anything like me, she’s just gonna be relieved.",Joey,,,,,
 They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!,Joey,,,,,
 An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here.,Joey,,,,,
 (wakes up) What?!,Joey,,,,,
 All right. All right.,Joey,,,,,
 Really? I don’t…,Joey,,,,,
 (starts singing) I wanna rock and roll all night! (Falls asleep.),Joey,,,,,
" (to himself) Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! (He opens his eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)",Joey,,,,,
 Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!,Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, I’ll play! I’ll play!",Joey,,,,,
" Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? (Starts singing.) Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!",Joey,,,,,
" Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn’t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I’ve got a really good one! I’ve been thinking about it since Kansas.",Joey,,,,,
 Yes.,Joey,,,,,
 That is incredible! You are the master!,Joey,,,,,
 What are you doing?,Joey,,,,,
 I can fix it. Hold on. (He goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment) Look out. Look out. (Pries at the door a little bit.),Joey,,,,,
 I’m not finished.,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey Monica!,Joey,,,,,
" (To Chandler) Hey man, you feeling any better? (Chandler answers him with some guttural sounds that only he can make and that no human can transcribe.)",Joey,,,,,
 Oh my God! You’re pregnant!,Joey,,,,,
" Wow! (Tearing up) Well, uh… Hey! I’m really happy for you guys! Congratulations! (Kisses Monica on the cheek) See you later. (Starts for the door on the verge of tears as Monica stops him.)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. (Turns towards the door, pauses, and turns back.) Like you’d believe that. This sucks!",Joey,,,,,
" (To Monica) Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you’re gonna be moving in with him I feel it’s my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He’s a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm… Oh-oh he always, he always umm—Oh, who am I kidding! He’s the best roommate ever! (Hugs Chandler.)",Joey,,,,,
" God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here. Y’know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. ""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?"" ""Can’t, its not there.""",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.,Joey,,,,,
 Hi.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie’s!!,Joey,,,,,
" So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?",Joey,,,,,
" Really?! Well, when?",Joey,,,,,
 Wow.,Joey,,,,,
 Great!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh-oh, what about Ross?",Joey,,,,,
 (To Chandler) Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra room over at my place…",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you.",Joey,,,,,
" I don’t know! How about, ""Thanks for taking the message."" Jeez! (Exits.)",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, what’s up?",Joey,,,,,
" But you’re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today. (Shows him the paper.)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah? I just figured y’know, after living with you it’d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who’s different than me. And what’s more different than me; a guy who’s not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? (Points to his head.) Not just a hat rack my friend!",Joey,,,,,
" (exiting from Chandler’s room with the new roommate) Everything on your application looks really good—Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",Joey,,,,,
" Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it.",Joey,,,,,
 That thing was a hazard! (To the potential roommate) I’m very safety conscious.,Joey,,,,,
" Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you’re right where you don’t want to be! Back together!",Joey,,,,,
" That’s not gonna work out! Then she’s gonna come home all weepy and you’ll be tellin’ her, ""Oh that’s okay. You’ll find someone."" And then, bamn! She finds you!",Joey,,,,,
" I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?",Joey,,,,,
" Here she comes. Hold on, I’m gonna make your life much easier.",Joey,,,,,
" Or not. Uh, Rach, why don’t you just move in with me? (Rachel sighs.)",Joey,,,,,
" No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay, I mean I—look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have to do that!",Joey,,,,,
" Thursday’s clearly not good for ya, pick a day!",Joey,,,,,
 (opening the door to The Potential Roommate) Hi!,Joey,,,,,
" Come in. Thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I’m gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.",Joey,,,,,
 Okay! Here we go. Pillow.,Joey,,,,,
 Very good! Okay. G.,Joey,,,,,
" Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.",Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but—bye-bye! (He ushers her out the door.)",Joey,,,,,
 I can’t believe she would say that too you.,Joey,,,,,
" (interrupting him) Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn’t have naked chicks on it.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh-ooh-ooh! Y’know what’s a good visual aide?,Joey,,,,,
 Why not?!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! Any good mail?,Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I’m kinda….",Joey,,,,,
 Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.,Joey,,,,,
 Let me see that!,Joey,,,,,
" (reads it) Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I gotta be careful?!",Joey,,,,,
" All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent.",Joey,,,,,
" (mocks him, in a whiney voice) …look both ways before you cross the street. (Turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Hey Estelle, listen…",Joey,,,,,
 What are you talkin’ about? I never left you! You’ve always been my agent!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
" Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.",Joey,,,,,
 Why?,Joey,,,,,
 b*st*rd!,Joey,,,,,
 (in obvious pain) Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time.,Joey,,,,,
 What?!,Joey,,,,,
" Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.",Joey,,,,,
" No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows Chandler.)",Joey,,,,,
 Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was using.) Damn you 15s!,Joey,,,,,
" Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing.",Joey,,,,,
" Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Look, I’m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here (He puts his hand down his pants, like Al Bundy on Married…With Children always used to do.) it doesn’t hurt that bad.",Joey,,,,,
" Sure, now I’m scared.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, but I don’t wanna die!",Joey,,,,,
" (in a gravely, painful voice) Okay. ""Hey, Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you.""",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I’ll just—hold on one second. (He turns around and puts his hand in his pants and groans in relief.) (In a relaxed voice.) ""Hey Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you!""",Joey,,,,,
" So that’s why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today! (He turns, looks at the bag and realizes he won’t be able to pick it up.)",Joey,,,,,
 Exactly.,Joey,,,,,
" Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. (She just looks at him.) I didn’t get it, did I?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, okay. (Leaves)",Joey,,,,,
 Hi. I’m Joey Tribbiani; I’m here to audition for (Groans) man.,Joey,,,,,
 Yes!,Joey,,,,,
 (barely audible through the pain) Thank you.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.",Joey,,,,,
 (to the director) Hiya!,Joey,,,,,
" Hi Alex! (to the director) And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants. (Holds them both up.)",Joey,,,,,
" ""Take could care of your Momma son."" (Alex just looks at him and the director motions for him to continue so he tries it again.) ""Take could care of your Momma son."" (Alex does nothing.) ""Come on son! Your Momma’s good people!""",Joey,,,,,
" Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?",Joey,,,,,
 Okay. (Starts screaming.),Joey,,,,,
" (he stops screaming at action) ""Take good care of your Momma son."" (Again Alex does nothing.)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don’t hold back. (He dons his protective helmet (Why, I have no clue.) and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey-hey-hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. (Looks at them) Ooohh, to a Porsche! {Transcriber’s note: Oh come on! Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind? If I had a Porsche, I’d have the keys surgically attached to my hand!} Hey Gunther, these yours?",Joey,,,,,
 Na-uh! (To everyone there) Hey did anybody lose their keys?,Joey,,,,,
 There’s a lost and found? (Gunther sets the box up on the table.) My shoe! (Grabs it out of the box.),Joey,,,,,
" Well, I didn’t realize until I got home. I wasn’t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y’know what? I’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield. (Goes to do so.)",Joey,,,,,
 Great! Thanks. (Exits.),Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, it’s not mine.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, it’s (looks up and sees the woman) mine.",Joey,,,,,
" Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?",Joey,,,,,
 (checks in the window to make sure it has them) It’s got ‘em!,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey guys!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey babies! Oh, I’m having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I’ve got the keys too, still there!",Joey,,,,,
" You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.",Joey,,,,,
" The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes his forehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they’re gonna start to think that I don’t own it. So I figured I’ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, she tops out at 130.",Joey,,,,,
 And that’s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.,Joey,,,,,
 Sure!,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, take it easy.",Joey,,,,,
" Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I’m just polishing her up.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, but it’s my wax.",Joey,,,,,
" Sure. Here. (He hands them over.) I’ll uh, save your parking spot.",Joey,,,,,
 Why not?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, so did I.",Joey,,,,,
 (entering wearing nothing but Porsche clothes) So the Porsche guy took his car back.,Joey,,,,,
" No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.",Joey,,,,,
 Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. (Starts to leave.)",Joey,,,,,
 Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her! (Storms out.),Joey,,,,,
 Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche?,Joey,,,,,
 (to women passing him) Porsche.,Joey,,,,,
 Hi! How are the Gellers?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! It’s Porsche!! (He’s right y’know.),Joey,,,,,
 Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! How you doin’?,Joey,,,,,
" I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping. (The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)",Joey,,,,,
 Right! And when is that due?,Joey,,,,,
 And that’s every month?,Joey,,,,,
 Ahhh.,Joey,,,,,
 (looking at it) Oh my God!!,Joey,,,,,
 No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.,Joey,,,,,
" No! Forget it! Okay—I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on.",Joey,,,,,
 This is how much we pay for electric?!!!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" I don’t know Ross, not if you’re gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.",Joey,,,,,
 (quietly) I’ve got Ben.,Joey,,,,,
 Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!",Joey,,,,,
" What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, you’re on.",Joey,,,,,
" (scores) Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That’s like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! (Goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.) $500 that is a loooot of electricity! (By the way, there’s nothing in the fridge.) Whoo-ho-ho! (Notices the sparseness of the fridge.) I gotta buy some food.",Joey,,,,,
 You serious?,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, get ready to owe me!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, here we go. Ready?",Joey,,,,,
" This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.",Joey,,,,,
" Nah, not my game.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, what’s it called?",Joey,,,,,
 I don’t know how to play Cups.,Joey,,,,,
 All right.,Joey,,,,,
 A two and a five.,Joey,,,,,
 Really?!,Joey,,,,,
 A four and a nine.,Joey,,,,,
 No. Why?,Joey,,,,,
 Damn! I am good at Cups!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, what did you have?",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, (counts the money) wow, 700.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 Really?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!",Joey,,,,,
" The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn’t even get half a cup! Nothin’!!",Joey,,,,,
" And he never played before either! Y’know what I think? I think beginner’s luck, very important in Cups.",Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I’m serious this time! In-in fact, look, there’s a—I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. (He rolls the big white dog over) Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y’know, thank you for being such a great roommate.",Joey,,,,,
" It’s him, not it!",Joey,,,,,
" Wait a second, I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’re trying to give me money again!",Joey,,,,,
" Over there! (Points to the couch) Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said ""No,"" you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!",Joey,,,,,
" I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can’t take care of myself. Okay? Look, I’m not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I’m gonna miss…is you. And now the dog.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, she's gonna live with me!",Joey,,,,,
" I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!",Joey,,,,,
 (shocked) From the land down under? I didn't know that either!,Joey,,,,,
 You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, hey let me. (Opens the door for Janine and after he closes the door behind her gasps ecstatically.)",Joey,,,,,
 Of course I did.,Joey,,,,,
" ""When can you move in?""",Joey,,,,,
" Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh God, yeah.",Joey,,,,,
 (happily) Okay!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!",Joey,,,,,
" Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.",Joey,,,,,
 You a little sad about that sweetheart?,Joey,,,,,
 (jumps out of the box) I Gotcha!!,Joey,,,,,
" Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!",Joey,,,,,
" (raises his hand) I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. (Gives Chandler the ""Joey-love,"" look.) How you doin?",Joey,,,,,
 (voice cracking) Ohhhh man,Joey,,,,,
" No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too. (Starts to stretch, groans painfully)",Joey,,,,,
 (jumps up and yells),Joey,,,,,
 Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. (Goes into the bathroom and comes back out quickly) Oh my God!,Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! (Tries to put his feet on the coffee table...they won't reach and looks around.) What the hell's going on over here?!?!? (Points to Chandler) Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.",Joey,,,,,
" No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?",Joey,,,,,
" This is great, this is great, what else, what else?",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, don't you mean ""for whom?""",Joey,,,,,
" Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.",Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?",Joey,,,,,
 Oh!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?",Joey,,,,,
 What?!?!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh dear God!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Sure, neighbor come on in.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, no, she’s at dance class.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, but, hey look, don’t go through her stuff. She gets really mad.(Chandler gives him a look and walks to the door of his old room.)",Joey,,,,,
 (Looking around the room.) It is???,Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
" (With Big Eyes.) All right, you’re right. I’ll talk to her.",Joey,,,,,
 I’m a man.,Joey,,,,,
 (Grunting) Hmm. (Monica opens the front door and comes in.),Joey,,,,,
" Or maybe, it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday. (Everybody gets up.)",Joey,,,,,
" Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, that’s what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh…Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It’s…too girly.",Joey,,,,,
 Like this. (pointing to the picture) Pictures of cute babies we don’t know. We..we can’t have that.,Joey,,,,,
" Look I don’t know this baby. I don’t know if she’s a famous artist or not. You know, and I don’t want to be a jerk but you’re changing too much around here.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah but it’s too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.",Joey,,,,,
" I’m sure it’s a famous watering can, okay. But, come on…and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?",Joey,,,,,
" Ohh, well, that’s ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It’s up here on some hook..and…smells different.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, well, it feels different.",Joey,,,,,
" Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels…Also what is with these chips you bought?",Joey,,,,,
 (Voice cracking) Well that’s like summer in a bowl.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders.,Joey,,,,,
" So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.",Joey,,,,,
" Ohh, I love birds. (Monica leaves. Chandler shuts the door.)",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.",Joey,,,,,
 No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.,Joey,,,,,
" It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it….Oh My God, I’m a women!!!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.",Joey,,,,,
" I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That’s just the way it has to be.",Joey,,,,,
" Great…Great…and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn’t want to make a big deal out of this, you know. (She starts to collect all the girlie stuff up.) You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.",Joey,,,,,
" And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.",Joey,,,,,
 And a couple of these little tiny boxes.,Joey,,,,,
 (Smiling) Okay.,Joey,,,,,
" Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?",Joey,,,,,
 Well maybe I love ya’.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! Yeah, why? What’s up?",Joey,,,,,
" Ye-ye, we go to yours!",Joey,,,,,
" How you got three women to marry you, I’ll never know.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!",Joey,,,,,
" Well, this has been great!",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, some of her friends, yeah.",Joey,,,,,
" (frustrated) Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they’re gonna be, be drinkin’ and dancin, and we really wanna go!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!",Joey,,,,,
" Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!",Joey,,,,,
 Y-sure!,Joey,,,,,
" I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?",Joey,,,,,
 (turning to Chandler in a scolding tone) Chandler!,Joey,,,,,
 (sad) Oh man! Now she’s gonna start all over! We’re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!,Joey,,,,,
 Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?,Joey,,,,,
 (shrugging his shoulders to go along with it) Vomiting stories are funny...,Joey,,,,,
 Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?,Joey,,,,,
 (frustrated) Still not hot enough!,Joey,,,,,
 (to Rachel) Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine’s friends are dancers?! And that they’re going to be drinking alot!?,Joey,,,,,
 Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh I am!,Joey,,,,,
 Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.",Joey,,,,,
" Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they’re all gonna’ make fun of her, do you want that?",Joey,,,,,
" (scolding) Dude, they’re not objects.",Joey,,,,,
" Just kiddin,’ I’ll talk to them, you distract Rach.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh and (Ross begins to open the door and Joey says some gibberish word to indicate to Ross that he’s not done yet. Ross closes the door again.) Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach (Rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying “mmm” and uh, oh oh! And smiling (Smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), okay?",Joey,,,,,
" Rachel, there you are! Come on, let’s serve that dessert already!",Joey,,,,,
 (happily) Really?,Joey,,,,,
 I like it.,Joey,,,,,
 What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.,Joey,,,,,
 (pounding the table) I wanna gooooooo!,Joey,,,,,
" No it isn’t, I ate that.",Joey,,,,,
" Nope, got it and I got yours (Pointing to Jack) too.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey you guys.,Joey,,,,,
" I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y’know, everywhere I look she’s like… (He imitates her stretching)",Joey,,,,,
 I like her so much!,Joey,,,,,
 I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.,Joey,,,,,
 Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you.,Joey,,,,,
 Did she just ask me out on a date?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’",Joey,,,,,
" OK, listen I’ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It’s a show, but we’re just dancing, OK? It’s no big deal. The important thing to remember – stay cool.",Joey,,,,,
 Ross! So when is it gonna air?,Joey,,,,,
 Really?,Joey,,,,,
 What do you mean?,Joey,,,,,
 Uh-huh.,Joey,,,,,
 No-no-no-no-no we came together!,Joey,,,,,
" No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. (The girl starts dancing really close to him, so he picks her up, twirls her round, and puts her against a platform) Here we go. (He walks away to find Monica and Ross doing a really out of place dance) Looking good Gellers!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you’re dancing with.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I’m trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..",Joey,,,,,
" Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she’s real, uh, mellow!",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know…",Joey,,,,,
" Alright, alright, hey y’know fair is fair, (he pretends to wash his hands) if you’re right, you’re right, what can I say, but hey oh no! (He throws water on the guy’s pants)",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, now you’re the one who wet his pants. (He throws another handful on him and runs out)",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, take a look at the guy’s pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don’t you think he went a little overboard?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, take a hike wetpants!",Joey,,,,,
 No! Year! Happy No Year!,Joey,,,,,
" Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year’s gonna go off. I guess there’s no reason for all that Y2K panic, y’know? Anyway, g’night!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yoii. What was that for?",Joey,,,,,
" Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.",Joey,,,,,
 But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?,Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
" 3, 2,",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?",Joey,,,,,
" Well all right then, I guess I shouldn’t get to excited about the fact (excitedly) that I just kissed her!",Joey,,,,,
 Oh we kissed it up real nice.,Joey,,,,,
 I came over here to tell you guys.,Joey,,,,,
 Okay. (They kiss.),Joey,,,,,
 Okay. (They kiss.),Joey,,,,,
" Okay, I’m all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips? (She kisses him on the cheek and starts to leave.)",Joey,,,,,
 Have you kissed her yet? It’s awesome! I could do it forever! Y’know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!,Joey,,,,,
 I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!,Joey,,,,,
 (indignant) I was tired!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! I made that for her!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.,Joey,,,,,
 And Chandler I can’t believe I let you pay for this one. (They hug and he whispers in his ear.) Thanks man.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.",Joey,,,,,
 Nope-op! I insist! (He hugs Chandler again and whispers to him.) You get the wine right?,Joey,,,,,
 See ya tomorrow!,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 What-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?,Joey,,,,,
 Blah?!,Joey,,,,,
" Uh, they’re like my best friends. Are you saying we can’t hang out with them? ‘Cause that would kinda be a problem.",Joey,,,,,
 I guess.,Joey,,,,,
" If you want, I’ll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.",Joey,,,,,
 Hi!,Joey,,,,,
" Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it’s just gonna be me again tonight.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, she’s uh-uh really sick.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, she’s been in there all day (Points to her room), uh high fever, a nose problem… Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!",Joey,,,,,
 ‘Kay!,Joey,,,,,
" No-no, she really is sick!",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, y’know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.",Joey,,,,,
" Well uh, she didn’t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I’m so sorry.",Joey,,,,,
" Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.",Joey,,,,,
" I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don’t-don’t be mad. I’m sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y’know? And it was our first date! Plus, she’s really sick!",Joey,,,,,
" I know, but don’t you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?",Joey,,,,,
" Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She’ll come around I promise.",Joey,,,,,
 (shouting) I can hear you!,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" So uh, what are you guys doing?",Joey,,,,,
" Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.",Joey,,,,,
" Ha-ha, very funny—Look! I don’t know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!",Joey,,,,,
" That’s right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!",Joey,,,,,
 You don’t think I know that!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh well then, good night!",Joey,,,,,
" See? Eh, wasn’t that fun?",Joey,,,,,
 All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler and Monica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.),Joey,,,,,
" All right, uh, we’ve got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can’t treat them that way.",Joey,,,,,
" I know! I know! And I’m going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They… They’re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I… I don’t think we can be together. It just, it just can’t work. It can’t. (Starts to break up) I’m very upset.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for her and she exits into the hallway.),Joey,,,,,
" Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! (They head downstairs.),Joey,,,,,
 How ya doin’?,Joey,,,,,
" Pretty much, yeah.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, when it’s not right, you know it.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! Yeah. I’ll be all right.,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 (laughing hysterically) You’re right! That did cheer me up!,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey guys.,Joey,,,,,
" Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?",Joey,,,,,
 Let’s go watch it at your place.,Joey,,,,,
" Chandler, Chandler, y’know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.",Joey,,,,,
" No, that’s VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It’s like a lotta noise to me. I don’t know…",Joey,,,,,
" I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill",Joey,,,,,
" No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.",Joey,,,,,
" I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the Playboy magazine).",Joey,,,,,
 Sure.,Joey,,,,,
 Not so much.,Joey,,,,,
 You forget how many great songs Heart had.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.",Joey,,,,,
" Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.",Joey,,,,,
 What?!,Joey,,,,,
 Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?,Joey,,,,,
 (sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat back to bed.),Joey,,,,,
" Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading up there.",Joey,,,,,
 Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there.,Joey,,,,,
" (to a table of strangers) You guys need anything, ‘cause I’m heading up there.",Joey,,,,,
 You got it.,Joey,,,,,
 Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a ‘what’s wrong with you?’ look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.),Joey,,,,,
" Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if they’re in on a secret together.)",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.",Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
" It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor and now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction.",Joey,,,,,
" I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird.",Joey,,,,,
" See, now it’s weird again.",Joey,,,,,
" Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.",Joey,,,,,
" Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part. Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but …",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is taken.’",Joey,,,,,
" No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?",Joey,,,,,
" So, you’d hire me, right?",Joey,,,,,
" Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a very important issue in this month’s Playboy. I’m sure you all read about it.",Joey,,,,,
" Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so …",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, what are ya gonna do?",Joey,,,,,
 That’s great. Thanks Rach.,Joey,,,,,
 I’m not answering that.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that’s (pauses to figure the total) $12.75.",Joey,,,,,
 Hi!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh that’s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, he’s not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him—He says it’s okay. (She hands him her card.) Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!",Joey,,,,,
 It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I’m getting more dates than ever!,Joey,,,,,
 How about a scone on the house baby?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin’?",Joey,,,,,
 (to a customer) Are you all finished here?,Joey,,,,,
 Great! (Joey takes his cookie and finishes it.),Joey,,,,,
 What?!,Joey,,,,,
" Well if it’s free food, how come you’re charging me for it?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?",Joey,,,,,
 (to a woman who came in third in a modeling contest) Sorry! (He grabs her muffin away and returns it to the serving tray.),Joey,,,,,
 That’ll be $3.85.,Joey,,,,,
" It’s just I can’t because my manager said I… (Gets an idea) (Starts singing) ""Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie…",Joey,,,,,
" (still singing) ""…Amy! Happy birthday to you!""",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, not it here it isn’t.",Joey,,,,,
" (singing) ""Happy birthday to you!""",Joey,,,,,
 What? No-no it’s her birthday!,Joey,,,,,
 But it really…,Joey,,,,,
 Damnit! (Storms off.),Joey,,,,,
" (overhearing them) Oh-ho, and mine!",Joey,,,,,
" (sees Rachel) Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh… Oh wait, I don’t have to lie to you, you don’t live here anymore. Uh, I’m eating their food. What are you doing?",Joey,,,,,
" Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister!",Joey,,,,,
 I can’t believe Ross went out with Rachel’s sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah you got 5 years left!,Joey,,,,,
 You wanna make it 6?!,Joey,,,,,
 (crying) You didn’t cry when Bambi’s mother died?,Joey,,,,,
" Come on man there’s gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, what if the puppy said, ""Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me.""",Joey,,,,,
 No! It’s not okay! It’s not okay at all!! You’re dead inside!!,Joey,,,,,
" (to the fan) So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, you’re Phoebe’s fan!",Joey,,,,,
 Movies?,Joey,,,,,
 (laughs) I don’t think so.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey Gunther, don’t let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe’s a p0rn star!",Joey,,,,,
" Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don’t think it’s the kind you’re gonna like.",Joey,,,,,
 Sort of…,Joey,,,,,
 (holds up the movie) Phoebe’s a p0rn star!,Joey,,,,,
 Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.,Joey,,,,,
" All right well, I’d better take that back.",Joey,,,,,
 We can’t watch that! I mean that’s Phoebe!,Joey,,,,,
" No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe’s our friend! Well, I’m not gonna watch it!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 (sitting at the kitchen table with his back to the TV) You sick bastards!,Joey,,,,,
 Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh no, not you too!",Joey,,,,,
 Nice!,Joey,,,,,
" That’s great, but isn’t it gonna bother that people still think you’re a p0rn star?",Joey,,,,,
 You do?,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 (To Ross) What is the matter with you?!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. (To Rachel) Who-who’s Barry and Mindy?",Joey,,,,,
" Ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her?",Joey,,,,,
 (starts to imagine it) I can’t. I keep seeing it the good way.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! (Closes his eyes to do so.) Oh-hey, there’s Carol again!",Joey,,,,,
" So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?",Joey,,,,,
 (not impressed) Wow!!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh dear God, let me think. (Starts to sarcastically think about it.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?",Joey,,,,,
 Really?,Joey,,,,,
" That’s an idea! (To Chandler) Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?",Joey,,,,,
 That’s great! That would be great! Let’s do that!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh right great! Welcome aboard!,Joey,,,,,
" All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don’t need any assistance in there, take a break!",Joey,,,,,
" (holding a plate of what looks like Rice Crispies Treats) I know, here-here!! (Hands her the plate.)",Joey,,,,,
 (shaking Rachel’s hand) Hi!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, it’s always nice to meet the fans.",Joey,,,,,
 (turning and whispering to Monica) She’s not crazy is she?,Joey,,,,,
" (To Rachel) So uh, how you doin’?",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey there you are!,Joey,,,,,
" All right, here’s a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I’m delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine! (Exits.)",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh great. (Starts to go in.) (To Chandler) Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!",Joey,,,,,
" All right, and over there is Brady’s Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. (Points at a large piece of television equipment as an old man walks by.) And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!",Joey,,,,,
" All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?",Joey,,,,,
" Why? (In Drake’s voice.) Why can’t the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, yeah but uh, (In Drake’s voice) I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, you watch too much TV.",Joey,,,,,
" Thanks! (Looks at it.) Yeah, there’s pulp in that. (Hands it back.)",Joey,,,,,
" I thought we talked about this. I don’t like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn’t juice. All juice, okay?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh my God, I’m sorry, I’m being so rude. (Turns to Rachel.) Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.",Joey,,,,,
 (To Chandler) Iced tea.,Joey,,,,,
 (To Rachel) Did I not just tell him?,Joey,,,,,
" (To Chandler) Okay look, Chandler, if this (Motions back and forth indicating the arrangement.) you have got to listen! (Tugs on his ear.) (Chandler glares at him.) You’re gonna throw that juice at me, aren’t ya?",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you’re mad, but I just want to say I’m sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y’know? I mean, y’know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I’m sorry. Here. (Hands him a cup.)",Joey,,,,,
" Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh my God! That’s great! Congratulations! What’s the story?!,Joey,,,,,
 Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!,Joey,,,,,
 Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? ‘Cause I think I read it!,Joey,,,,,
" I know. (Joey is sitting in this tall chair that is made up of balls on polls. You’ll have to see it to know what I mean.) Yeah, his name is Pat.",Joey,,,,,
" (climbing down from his chair) Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?",Joey,,,,,
" Pretty cool, huh? But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.",Joey,,,,,
" It’s uh, right through there. (Points.)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, life’s pretty great isn’t it?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah you did.,Joey,,,,,
 Here you go. Let me ask you a question.,Joey,,,,,
 When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?,Joey,,,,,
" Come, come here.",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Morning!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Well he actually saw you a little bit too.,Joey,,,,,
" No! No! No, not after seeing that.",Joey,,,,,
 Wh-why?,Joey,,,,,
" That’s ridiculous! I’m not a ""Star,"" just a regular famous actor.",Joey,,,,,
" Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me…",Joey,,,,,
" Wow! Uh okay, well uh… (He gets up, opens a drawer, and pulls out the ring.)",Joey,,,,,
 Sure! As long as they don’t find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.,Joey,,,,,
" Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you’ve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn’t. And that’s what this ring stands for.",Joey,,,,,
" Look, do you want the ring or not?!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 All right!,Joey,,,,,
" Whoa-whoa-whoa! You’re not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?",Joey,,,,,
" (not quite sure of how to answer that) Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol’s great and I’m sure you’re a very attractive man, but I….",Joey,,,,,
 You?,Joey,,,,,
 Wow!,Joey,,,,,
" All right! So, was it amazing?",Joey,,,,,
 Just okay—Did you do it right?!,Joey,,,,,
" Huh. But still Ross, you’re worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y’know what I mean?",Joey,,,,,
" But you got to be with both of them, right?",Joey,,,,,
 Not the other one?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, you don’t want that.",Joey,,,,,
" Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?",Joey,,,,,
 You got a little bored?,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah? What did ya have?,Joey,,,,,
 Sounds good.,Joey,,,,,
" (he’s just picked up their bill) Hey! So, what’s with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?",Joey,,,,,
 Y’know what’s more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y’know what’s even more generous than that?!!,Joey,,,,,
" All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, y’know? I’m down to like three! Well, actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened in some teeth—Why did I do that?! (Hits himself in the head.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!",Joey,,,,,
" No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let’s see uh, well I don’t want to donate sperm again. (To Ross) I really prefer doing that at the home office y’know? (Ross nods his head.) Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
 Uhh do it?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, where was I? (Takes a sip of the coffee.)",Joey,,,,,
 Takes it out of you? (Laughs.),Joey,,,,,
" Ohh, hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?",Joey,,,,,
" And of course, crotchless panties.",Joey,,,,,
" You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut…",Joey,,,,,
" (to the receptionist) Hi uh, I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I’d like to donate some fluids.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up. (She just looks at him in horror.) Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?",Joey,,,,,
 Thanks. (Starts to read it.) Well but this one starts now. (Points to one.),Joey,,,,,
" But it’s $2,000.",Joey,,,,,
 Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.,Joey,,,,,
" (in his head) 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? (The camera widens its shot to reveal a room full of Joey look-a-likes. Joey looks at the guy next to him and then back at his script.)",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) No! No! No! No! No! How you doin’?! How you doin’—Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall! (Goes into the hall.),Joey,,,,,
" Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y’know? The only problem is, Carl’s acting is… (Does the international hand symbol for so-so.)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, he’s the reason I didn’t get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.",Joey,,,,,
 (to Carl) Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! (Carl does so.),Joey,,,,,
" All right Carl, we’re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?",Joey,,,,,
 That’s right! And what are you not gonna do?,Joey,,,,,
" (gets very angry) Damnit Carl! (Carl goes to say something more, and Joey silences him with a grunt.)",Joey,,,,,
 That’s us.,Joey,,,,,
" That’s right, $2,000.",Joey,,,,,
 Damnit Carl!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, ‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there’s your admirer. (Ross is stunned.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, well think of it like this, when you’re 90…",Joey,,,,,
" No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh well listen, anyway she’s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!",Joey,,,,,
" No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?",Joey,,,,,
" All right! Thanks! You’re the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?",Joey,,,,,
" (angrily) Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!",Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
" The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!",Joey,,,,,
" (to the fireman) Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, how bad is it?",Joey,,,,,
" Chandler, is that… (Mimes someone using a movie camera and Chandler nods yes.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey-hey listen… (Chandler waves him away.),Joey,,,,,
" When you’re off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey listen, so when’s-when’s my audition? I mean I know it’s Thursday, but what time?",Joey,,,,,
 Ah-ha!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. (He turns around to see Chandler glaring at him.)",Joey,,,,,
 This right here is where I keep the pizza. (He points to the chair.) And uh that’s where the napkin is. (Points to the floor next to the chair.),Joey,,,,,
 I know! (Shrugs his shoulders.),Joey,,,,,
 This is where I keep the pizza. (It’s the same location as before.) And—Hey! Where did the napkin go?! (The napkin is not in it’s spot.),Joey,,,,,
" (in a funny voice) Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn’t the hair straightener that started the fire. (Rachel prompts him on what to say next.) No-no, it was the candles. It’s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is… (Phoebe suddenly enters.) Uhh… Uhh… Okay. Well, I have to go now. (Phoebe leaves.)",Joey,,,,,
" Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?",Joey,,,,,
 You couldn’t do it?!,Joey,,,,,
 Ah whatever!,Joey,,,,,
 No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.,Joey,,,,,
 Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.),Joey,,,,,
 I know.,Joey,,,,,
" All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and eats it.)",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, here you go. (Hands her another one.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, very funny. I don’t know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. (Chandler doesn’t say anything until Joey figures it out.) You got me the audition?! Let’s hug it up! (They hug.)",Joey,,,,,
" That’s right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey’s.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 So?,Joey,,,,,
" Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs—(He gasps in horror.) Oh! (Runs out and Chandler just shakes his head. After a second Joey runs back in to grab a piece of pizza and runs back out.)",Joey,,,,,
" Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! (He grabs a screwdriver and starts to attack the compressor, only he causes a small short circuit and shocks himself.) Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!",Joey,,,,,
 Great! Roomie!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.",Joey,,,,,
" Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya’?",Joey,,,,,
" All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I’ll take a check for the other hundred.",Joey,,,,,
 Of course I’m jokin’! I don’t take checks.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I’m sorry. Thank you Chandler.",Joey,,,,,
 Ooh! So close.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how’s it going with her?",Joey,,,,,
 Huh.,Joey,,,,,
" The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes—Hey, what was in that brown jar?",Joey,,,,,
" Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?",Joey,,,,,
 No! No! No! For my new fridge—our new fridge!,Joey,,,,,
" So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.",Joey,,,,,
" And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.",Joey,,,,,
 (pause) Give me $400!,Joey,,,,,
" Or! You can just, y’know… (He walks up close to whisper in Ross’s ear and when he gets there he pushes Ross into the fridge.)",Joey,,,,,
 What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh-ho-ho, you think I don’t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! (He opens the door and feels inside.) Well what do you know! Broken! That’ll be $400!",Joey,,,,,
 (pause) You pushed him!,Joey,,,,,
" All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?",Joey,,,,,
 I still haven’t gotten a check for your half yet.,Joey,,,,,
 I’m not talking to you! You broke my fridge!,Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!",Joey,,,,,
 Really?!,Joey,,,,,
 Call it even?,Joey,,,,,
" Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?",Joey,,,,,
 Sure! I was there! Spring Break ’81! Woo-hoo!,Joey,,,,,
" So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y’know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.,Joey,,,,,
" Ahh, to be 13 again.",Joey,,,,,
" The reactor’s gonna blow in three seconds, we’re never gonna make it!",Joey,,,,,
 No! I won’t leave you!,Joey,,,,,
 No you’re not! Not to me!,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, you’re great! Okay, let’s take it from…",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.",Joey,,,,,
 Y’know what? I think that’s enough for now. Yeah. I don’t want to be over rehearsed.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, it’s a new TV show. Yeah. I’m up for the part of Mac Macaveli or ""Mac."" Yeah, I’m a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He’s a, he’s a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or ""C.H.E.E.S.E.""",Joey,,,,,
 That’s the title! Yeah! Y’know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, don’t get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.",Joey,,,,,
 I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don’t know if I’m good enough.,Joey,,,,,
 You really think so?,Joey,,,,,
"  Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.",Joey,,,,,
"  It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. (Does this intense look where it looks like he's smelling a fart.)",Joey,,,,,
" (there's a gunshot on TV) There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] ""Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.  I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."" (Does the smell-the-fart look.)",Joey,,,,,
" (on stage in an Austrian accent) Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)",Joey,,,,,
"  I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.",Joey,,,,,
"  C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!",Joey,,,,,
" All right well, I’m outta here. Wish me luck.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, whatever. (Exits.)",Joey,,,,,
" (entering, dejectedly) Hey.",Joey,,,,,
 Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn’t even be an actor!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, did I fool ya?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, it went amazingly well!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah-yeah, it’s down to me and two other guys.",Joey,,,,,
" And I know both of them, they’re really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who’s always getting chased by those big flowers…",Joey,,,,,
 I’m just so nervous! Y’know? The callback isn’t until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!,Joey,,,,,
" There’s just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don’t know if you’d understand.",Joey,,,,,
" I want this part so much! Y’know? If I don’t get this part I’m never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!—No, I didn’t say that! That’s a lie.",Joey,,,,,
 Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?,Joey,,,,,
" (on phone) Hello? (Listens) What are you talking about? The audition’s not ‘til 5:00! (Chandler suddenly remembers and looks at the unfinished message then tries to sneak over and finish it as Joey listens.) Well, nobody told me! (Listens) Who’d you talk to? (Listens and turns around to see Chandler trying to finish the message.) Nevermind! (Hangs up.)",Joey,,,,,
 The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!,Joey,,,,,
 How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could’ve turned my whole career around!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, you don’t even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!",Joey,,,,,
  And what?! Did you sleep with her?!,Joey,,,,,
  What?!! That’s even worse!!,Joey,,,,,
  I don’t know! But it’s the same!,Joey,,,,,
"  Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!",Joey,,,,,
 Name one!,Joey,,,,,
" (getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!",Joey,,,,,
"  Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!",Joey,,,,,
"  I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do?",Joey,,,,,
 No way!  I've been going to the guy for 12 years.,Joey,,,,,
" That's how they do pants!  Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?",Joey,,,,,
 I said name one!,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.",Joey,,,,,
 Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 What message?,Joey,,,,,
 What?! It’s 6 o’clock!,Joey,,,,,
 I can’t believe this Chandler!,Joey,,,,,
 Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, well I’m uh…",Joey,,,,,
" Oh wow! Okay man, I’m sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.",Joey,,,,,
 (shocked) That’s mean! You really had me going there!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, you’re right. Okay look, listen, let’s talk about what a huge star I’m gonna be!",Joey,,,,,
 You hug me!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, do we do this too much?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I’m not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.",Joey,,,,,
 Wow! (Back to reading the scene.) Well then I’ll just have to carry you.,Joey,,,,,
" Ross, you don’t have to yell.",Joey,,,,,
 Y’know what? I think that’s enough for today. Thanks for your help! (He grabs their scripts and heads for his room.),Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey guys!,Joey,,,,,
 Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I’ve dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!,Joey,,,,,
" But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don’t know anything about technology! I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find p0rn! And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!",Joey,,,,,
" Wow! Huh? (Picks up the phone) Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?",Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh wow! He’s so lifelike! (Starts touching the guy’s cheeks) Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy’s ears.,Joey,,,,,
" (slaps Wayne on his cheek) How do you do there, Wayne? (Backs away.)",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. Sorry about that…(Mimics that cheek thing he just did.) Uh, so where’s C.H.E.E.S.E.?",Joey,,,,,
" (laughs) This is like the temporary robot, right?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y’know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.",Joey,,,,,
" I’m sorry, it just—I don’t know it doesn’t really look like it can do anything.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.,Joey,,,,,
" Anyway, it wasn’t the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn’t like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!",Joey,,,,,
" I may have to, I hate to do it, but I’m the star! Y’know? There’s a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. (His cell phone rings) Excuse me. (Answers it, on phone) Joey Tribbiani.",Joey,,,,,
 Wow!,Joey,,,,,
 I’m the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!,Joey,,,,,
" Apparently, there’s like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there’s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn’t know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?",Joey,,,,,
" Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.",Joey,,,,,
" That’s not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. (Starts to leave, but stops and turns to Phoebe.) Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs. (Exits.)",Joey,,,,,
" Morning! Hey, how’s my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?! (Pats C.H.E.E.S.E. on the head.)",Joey,,,,,
" Okay! (He yanks his hand away.) All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! (He grabs C.H.E.E.S.E.’s arm and pulls it off at the elbow.) Ah-ah!! (Wayne is shocked.) Okay, that’s why you didn’t want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? (Hands Wayne the arm and he goes to fix it. Meanwhile Joey starts to berate himself.) Stupid! I can’t believe it! God! (A very beautiful woman walks by.) (To her) Hey, how you doin’? (He and her go over to talk and Wayne looks on with envy.)",Joey,,,,,
 I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah? Well, I don’t want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. (They shake hands.)",Joey,,,,,
 (incredulous) Why should I help you?!,Joey,,,,,
 (happily) What do you need?,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
 What are you in love with her or something?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh wow Wayne, it’s not really something you can teach y’know? It’s pretty much something you’re born with if you—(Off Chandler’s look)—You-you can teach it! I’ll show you right how to do it.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.",Joey,,,,,
" You got it! And the rabbi’s beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! (Pauses as he waits for C.H.E.E.S.E.’s next line.) It’s your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! (Suddenly C.H.E.E.S.E. goes crazy and starts flinging it’s arms and advancing on Joey behind the desk.) Wayne! Wayne!!",Joey,,,,,
 (nodding knowingly) Now you’re thinking you gotta sleep with him.,Joey,,,,,
 Me too.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh man! (Hits Chandler),Joey,,,,,
 Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!,Joey,,,,,
" I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin’ up about something… Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he’s just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi b*st*rd, I’ll…",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! So I’m back.,Joey,,,,,
" Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! (The dry cleaner doesn’t remember) Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? (Holds his picture up in front of his face.) Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I’m ready to go back up on the wall I’m the star of a new TV show.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh well, it’s not on TV yet.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? (Walks away)",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?",Joey,,,,,
" All right, let’s get me back up there! (Holds out his picture.)",Joey,,,,,
 What—But you saw the show!,Joey,,,,,
 Dry cleaners?,Joey,,,,,
" Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that’s offensive to Russians.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh you should, it’s great.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, you’re kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I’m an actor; I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? (Pause) You’re the other one right? (She thinks about it for a second and nods yes.)",Joey,,,,,
 I didn’t do that! Who would’ve done that?!,Joey,,,,,
" Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did not go out with your wife! (The same woman from before enters.) Okay? I went out with her! (Points at her.)",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey Gunther.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.",Joey,,,,,
" No! No, I quit a long time ago. (Pause) Did I forget to you that one? I’m sorry.",Joey,,,,,
 Great! (Takes his coffee and leaves.),Joey,,,,,
 Hey. (Heads straight for the fridge.),Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I’m sorry. You wanna bite? (Holds his piece out for him.)",Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!",Joey,,,,,
 Oh wow that’s a great idea! And I still have his credit card.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. (Hands Gunther Chandler’s card.) Y’know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just—I don’t get Chandler. Y’know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don’t get all upset.",Joey,,,,,
 All the time!,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! (Motions to Chandler, ""What’s going on?"") Hi, Paul is it? (Paul nods yes and still hugging Joey.)",Joey,,,,,
" Yes, it’s in my… In…in my pocket. (Paul hasn’t dropped him yet.) (Chandler starts to reach for his front pocket.) My back pocket! My back pocket!",Joey,,,,,
 Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.,Joey,,,,,
" Come on! It’ll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and… Paul probably…",Joey,,,,,
 No! He blew us off!,Joey,,,,,
 I know!,Joey,,,,,
 Can I tell you something? Me too.,Joey,,,,,
 Ooooh! Freeze him out.,Joey,,,,,
 I like it!,Joey,,,,,
" From now on, it’s gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. (They shake hands.) Okay! We’re gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.",Joey,,,,,
 (To Ross) I think we gotta end the freeze out.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh my God!!,Joey,,,,,
" And-and-and-and-and-and, and we’re gonna be friends again!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh it’s water under the bridge, forget it!",Joey,,,,,
 I think I’m gonna cry!,Joey,,,,,
 (holding an empty tissue box) Where’s all the tissues?! (Throws the box down in disgust.),Joey,,,,,
" Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?",Joey,,,,,
 That sounds perfect!,Joey,,,,,
 You’re gonna mess it up let me do it.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey Rach!,Joey,,,,,
 Where are you going?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, y’know what? I’ll come too. I’m making money now; it’s about time I give something back.",Joey,,,,,
 Okay. Have a benefit.,Joey,,,,,
 That’s not what she said last night. (Ross glares at him.),Joey,,,,,
 It’s the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!,Joey,,,,,
 (behind them) Oh!! Shrimp toast! (Walks right past the little group on his way for the shrimp toast.),Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 I won! That was my guess!,Joey,,,,,
" I guessed 20,000!",Joey,,,,,
" What?! I don’t have 20,000!",Joey,,,,,
 I didn’t know it was an auction!,Joey,,,,,
" I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!",Joey,,,,,
 I don’t know! Charity?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh hi!,Joey,,,,,
" Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?",Joey,,,,,
" (To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can’t buy the boat, I don’t have any money.",Joey,,,,,
" So uh listen, I think I’m gonna take off now. (Starts to get up.)",Joey,,,,,
" Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don’t have that kind of money!",Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
" Look, I don’t know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y’know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!",Joey,,,,,
" Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.",Joey,,,,,
 (To Phoebe) Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.,Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?",Joey,,,,,
" Ahh, yes. (Pushes Rachel in front of himself so that she could do the talking.)",Joey,,,,,
 You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess.,Joey,,,,,
 Are you kidding me?! She’s gonna this boat!,Joey,,,,,

 Glove salesman!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! (They give each other fives.)",Joey,,,,,

" Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. (They both squint at each other.) I never noticed that before.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" (laughs) Yeah, Big Brother.",Joey,,,,,
 (all excited) The Mr. Bowmont’s here!!! (Jumps over the back off the couch and runs out into the street.),Joey,,,,,
" Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?",Joey,,,,,

" This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?",Joey,,,,,
" Whoa-whoa, what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain!",Joey,,,,,
 Chandler giving you a hard time huh?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, you know Chandler.",Joey,,,,,
 Maybe you changed?,Joey,,,,,
 Maybe that’s the problem.,Joey,,,,,
" Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.",Joey,,,,,
 I don’t know! (All excited) I haven’t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.,Joey,,,,,
" Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!",Joey,,,,,
 There are?,Joey,,,,,
 R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! (Monica nods yes.) And-and Chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?!,Joey,,,,,
 Chandler loves marriage!!,Joey,,,,,
 You got that from what I said?!,Joey,,,,,
 Where the hell have you been?!,Joey,,,,,
 Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! Yeah, I’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep flying off!",Joey,,,,,
 I know! They suck!!,Joey,,,,,

" Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 Dude-dude-dude!,Joey,,,,,
" Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.",Joey,,,,,

 Pick me!!,Joey,,,,,
" This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!",Joey,,,,,
 Okay that’s fair.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Dude!,Joey,,,,,
 She’s gone.,Joey,,,,,
 She’s gone. She had a bag and she left.,Joey,,,,,
" She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.",Joey,,,,,
" I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believe me.",Joey,,,,,
 To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But if I were you I would.,Joey,,,,,
 I am so sorry man.,Joey,,,,,
 (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 (grabbing the candy bar) Yeah I’ll take that.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, she’s been out there for twenty minutes, I’m surprised you didn’t hear her on the way over.",Joey,,,,,
" But I-I-I can’t stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I’m supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. (Everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) What?",Joey,,,,,
 You guys don’t think I look 19?,Joey,,,,,
" (To Phoebe) Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?",Joey,,,,,
 I was afraid of that.,Joey,,,,,
 ‘Sup? ‘Sup dude?,Joey,,,,,
" So you’re playing a little Playstation, huh? That’s whack! Playstation is whack! ‘Sup with the whack Playstation, ‘sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!",Joey,,,,,
" Come on man, really how old?!",Joey,,,,,
 Wow thanks! (He goes into his bedroom and closes the door.),Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
" When? Today? Some, not a lot.",Joey,,,,,
" Don’t worry about that man, that happens.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! Once.,Joey,,,,,
 I did it anyway.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 You guys kissed! Oh my—this is huge!,Joey,,,,,
" Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.",Joey,,,,,
" You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!",Joey,,,,,
 Really?,Joey,,,,,
 Seriously?,Joey,,,,,
 (gasps) I’m 30!,Joey,,,,,
 (realizes) Aww crap!,Joey,,,,,
" Psss, that is whack!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! Well, I think we’ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, ""You look 19,"" and then they just take it away like-like, ""No you don’t.""",Joey,,,,,
 Wouldn’t she?,Joey,,,,,
 Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) You ate my candy bar!,Joey,,,,,
" They break your heart, don’t they?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!",Joey,,,,,
 What?! What’s wrong with my eyes.,Joey,,,,,
 And that’ll get rid of my wisdom?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Who wants French toast?,Joey,,,,,
" Good, me too. (Tosses him the loaf.) Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.",Joey,,,,,
" (sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds up one.) Y’know, something a little snugglyer?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, the duck…",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!",Joey,,,,,
" (sitting up again) Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I’m gonna get cranky!",Joey,,,,,
" Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!",Joey,,,,,
" All right, I’m gonna go! (Gets up and heads for the door.)",Joey,,,,,
 I don’t know! But he did not eat your face cream!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? (The duck does not get sick and Joey recoils in horror and heads for the couch.) What the hell is in that face cream? (He’s about to try out the couch but notices the bed in Rachel’s room. He walks into her room and feels the bed.) That’s so soft. (He pulls back the comforter.) Pillowcases! (He climbs in and groans in delight. Suddenly, he feels something under him and pulls out a little beat up paperback book. He opens it and starts to read from it.) (In his head.) Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar…(Stops reading and thinks.) The vicar? (Continues reading) …wouldn’t be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his…(Out loud.) Whoa! (Reads on in silence.) Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book! (Continues to read.)",Joey,,,,,
 Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on?,Joey,,,,,
 Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?,Joey,,,,,
 Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours.,Joey,,,,,
" Where do you think, (pause) Zelda?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah I did!,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn’t have, but you got p0rn!",Joey,,,,,
 You got p0rn!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey Rach.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?",Joey,,,,,
" No-no-no, I’m serious. You don’t smell it? Something’s on fire.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.",Joey,,,,,
" Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?",Joey,,,,,
 Gotcha.,Joey,,,,,
" Hello, Zelda.",Joey,,,,,
 The vicar!,Joey,,,,,
" Like a goalie, right?",Joey,,,,,
" All right, I’m sorry. Rach I—Rach I’m sorry. Okay? I’m sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. (Giggles.)",Joey,,,,,
 Huh?,Joey,,,,,
 (nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.),Joey,,,,,
 This body? (He backs into the kitchen.),Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey, you’re startin’ to sound like the butcher’s wife there in-in chapter seven.",Joey,,,,,
" I don’t want to, I’m scared.",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler’s eyes!",Joey,,,,,
 Feminine.,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Ahoy!,Joey,,,,,
 Great! I’m finally getting into this sailing stuff.,Joey,,,,,
 Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, it’s great! It’s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks a beer, and eats a chip.)",Joey,,,,,
 You could?,Joey,,,,,
 (drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because he’s got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To Rachel) Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?,Joey,,,,,
" What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there. (Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)",Joey,,,,,
 All right.,Joey,,,,,
" Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let’s start sailing, and I want to go over there (Points) where that boatload of girls is! (Yelling to them) Yo-ho-ho!",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, boat rope.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, rub it?",Joey,,,,,
" I’d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh…",Joey,,,,,
 And deaf!,Joey,,,,,
 Yes.,Joey,,,,,
 I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" I don’t want to talk about it. Y’know, you could’ve at least saved me a whole cookie. (He grabs what’s left of the cookie and pops in his mouth.)",Joey,,,,,
 (recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.),Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh uh, I don’t know the boat way to say this, but uh never!",Joey,,,,,
 Because! You’re mean on the boat!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!",Joey,,,,,
" Does a good teacher say, ""Put down the beer pinhead!?""",Joey,,,,,
 Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?,Joey,,,,,
 Well it hit me anyway! And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.,Joey,,,,,
 You won’t boss me around anymore?,Joey,,,,,
 And you’ll be nice?,Joey,,,,,
 And you’ll be topless?,Joey,,,,,
 Do you want me to learn?!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Nope.,Joey,,,,,
 I don’t know why you just don’t say left.,Joey,,,,,
 Huh?,Joey,,,,,
" (hurrying over) Okay! Okay, you’re yelling again! See that?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, y’know what? Since I’m here, I think I’m gonna have me a little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!",Joey,,,,,
 All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you taking your top off! I quit!,Joey,,,,,
 Why not?!,Joey,,,,,
 Greens? I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!,Joey,,,,,
 Yes! Yes! You did and you’re still yelling at me!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, hey I did learn.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! Come on.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, it’s okay. I know what a mainsail is. (Points to it. It’s the larger sail.) I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.",Joey,,,,,
 Damnit!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don’t you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)",Joey,,,,,
 Just pull on it.,Joey,,,,,
 What else?,Joey,,,,,
 Thank you.,Joey,,,,,
 What are you doing?,Joey,,,,,
 What you—don’t hold it like that! You’re lettin’ all the good stuff fall out.,Joey,,,,,
 Careful! You’re wasting good pastrami! (Gasps.) Oh my God! I’m my dad!,Joey,,,,,
" (laughing and turning off the TV) So, what did you guys think?",Joey,,,,,
" (on phone) Mom, so what did you think? (He walks away allowing the gang a chance to figure out what they’re gonna say.)",Joey,,,,,
" (hangs up the phone) Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? (Phoebe smiles, walks up to him, and presses her breasts against him.) It wasn’t that good.",Joey,,,,,
 (entering from bathrooms excitedly) You guys! You guys! You’re not gonna believe what my agent just told me!,Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.",Joey,,,,,
 I’m gonna be on two TV shows!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, you weren’t finished?",Joey,,,,,
" Uh Rach, if you’re gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.",Joey,,,,,
" (groans in disgust) Wow, it’s really long.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, these really are the days of our lives.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!",Joey,,,,,
" I’ll be playing Drake Ramoray’s twin brother, Stryker!",Joey,,,,,
 (jumps up) Well—I got a head rush from standing up too fast right there.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey Terry!,Joey,,,,,
" It’s been a while, huh? Wow, it’s funny these halls look smaller than they used to.",Joey,,,,,
 So! Stryker Ramoray huh? When do you want me to start?,Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 (looking between the pages and him) Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I was Dr. Drake Ramoray, Stryker’s twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?",Joey,,,,,
" Y’know Terry, I-I don’t really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, (Pause) with a robot.",Joey,,,,,
" Well. I guess you think you’re pretty special huh? Sittin’ up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y’know what? (Throws the script away) This is one star who’s hoop… This is a star that the hoop—this hoop—I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 Was she happy you gave her the job?,Joey,,,,,
" (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? (To Phoebe and Rachel) It’s the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? (On phone) Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week’s script. (Listens) Canceled?! (Listens) Like they’re taking it off the air? (Listens) Ohh. (Listens) All right, see you Monday. (Listens) We’re not even shootin’ them anymore?!! (Listens) All right, bye! (Hangs up) They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!",Joey,,,,,
 Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!,Joey,,,,,
" How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin’!",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.",Joey,,,,,
 Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.,Joey,,,,,
 Because they wanted me to audition!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! Terry.,Joey,,,,,
" Wait! Terry! Wait—Look—Wait I-I… Look, I’m really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I’m too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.",Joey,,,,,
" Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.",Joey,,,,,
 (jumping up and removing the bandages) I’m back baby! Ha-ha-ha!,Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, well I’ve got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. (Removes his hand to reveal a huge sauce stain.) You got an extra one?",Joey,,,,,
 Great. (He doesn’t like it.) You got anything that’s not Ralph Lauren?,Joey,,,,,
" All right, I guess this will be fine.",Joey,,,,,
" Nothing, why?",Joey,,,,,
" Huh, Rach I got to say it’s gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.",Joey,,,,,
 Really? ‘Cause I could kinda use the money.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, okay.",Joey,,,,,
" Sure, no problem. (Sees something.) Ooh—Hey, donuts!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. (He grabs a jelly donut, takes a bite, and guess what he spills all over himself. He tries to clean it up and smears it all over the shirt.)",Joey,,,,,
" See? That’s a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. (Chandler immediately does The Face.) You’re changing it!",Joey,,,,,
" All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, first—first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down (Looks down), look down, keep looking down; then I look up. (Looks up and smiles.) See? All right, now you try. Look down (Chandler looks down), you’re looking down, keep looking down…",Joey,,,,,
 I had a donut. (Chandler nods.),Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! That guy’s alright!,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women. Y’know, that’s why I never had any luck with Chandler.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey! No-no-no-no, you can’t take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!",Joey,,,,,
 (shocked) What?!,Joey,,,,,
" I know, Monica told me.",Joey,,,,,
 I don’t know Rach.,Joey,,,,,
 One! (Pause.) No ten! You said ten! You can’t take that back!,Joey,,,,,
" I don’t know. You uh, you got something for me?",Joey,,,,,
 Ten. Okay. Now Tag there’s such a thing as too many women.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, for you!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, we look great together.",Joey,,,,,
" Y’know, we don’t have to imagine.",Joey,,,,,
 We’ll just see.,Joey,,,,,
" Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?",Joey,,,,,
 Die Hard 2.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!",Joey,,,,,
 And?,Joey,,,,,
 What are you talking about? Bitch.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I don’t know!!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I’d better go.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. All right, I’ll talk to you later.",Joey,,,,,
" No! Never! Never! (Pause, then Joey wants to shake Ross’s hand.) Bye.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! What’s going on?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)",Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations.",Joey,,,,,
" Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best of the people they see, they give me the part.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.",Joey,,,,,
 Hi.,Joey,,,,,
" Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.",Joey,,,,,
" Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!",Joey,,,,,
 Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!,Joey,,,,,
 Okay! When?!,Joey,,,,,
 Uh-huh!,Joey,,,,,
 I want to do it again.,Joey,,,,,
 Why not?,Joey,,,,,
 Fine! Do you want something to drink?,Joey,,,,,
 Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. (Ross just leaves.),Joey,,,,,
" Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.",Joey,,,,,
 Why is 10 the highest?,Joey,,,,,
 (crying) I don’t want to marry Chandler!,Joey,,,,,
 I’ve got cold feet.,Joey,,,,,
" No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!",Joey,,,,,
" (out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, Phoebe…",Joey,,,,,
" We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, ""I do"" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!",Joey,,,,,
 Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!,Joey,,,,,
 Wow. (To Ross) Good speech.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 And she’s back in the game.,Joey,,,,,
" All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!",Joey,,,,,
" Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.)",Joey,,,,,
" No reason, I’m just saying that uh… That’s where I’ll be.",Joey,,,,,
 Great nap.,Joey,,,,,
 (reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God! (Heads for his room leaving Ross.),Joey,,,,,
 Morning!,Joey,,,,,
 Pretty good.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I’m late for work.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah—Hey, don’t worry, she’s a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I’m not looking for a serious relationship; that’d be great.",Joey,,,,,
" Just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I’m a loner—No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up with the likes of me.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I’m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He’d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he’d make extras and leave ‘em for me.",Joey,,,,,
" Fine! (Pause) Now, where’d we land on those pancakes? (She chases him out the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! What’s up?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey, who’s your friend? (Erin turns around to face Joey, startling him) Hey!!",Joey,,,,,
 Erin! Still here!,Joey,,,,,
 Why wouldn’t ya? Erin is great! Then-then there’s you guys.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. I’ll uh, I’ll call ya.",Joey,,,,,
" (to Erin) Okay, good to see you again.",Joey,,,,,
 Bye-bye.,Joey,,,,,
" So, system kinda broke down huh?!",Joey,,,,,
 What?!!,Joey,,,,,
 No idea? Who do you think brought her here?,Joey,,,,,
" Man, do you know what guys want!",Joey,,,,,
" My beers?! Look you guys, she’s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just—I don’t see it going anywhere.",Joey,,,,,
" Look, I’m sorry you guys, I-I just don’t think so.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, don’t start judging me! (To Rachel) Huh? You’re the one who’s in love with her assistant! (To Phoebe) Huh? And you, you’re the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!",Joey,,,,,
" Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?",Joey,,,,,
" All right, so we should go catch our movie.",Joey,,,,,
 I like to see the previews. (Rachel looks at him.) The candy.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Erin.,Joey,,,,,
 (skeptical) What party?,Joey,,,,,
 Who’s birthday party?,Joey,,,,,
" (still skeptical) Oh, and how old is Alison?",Joey,,,,,
" (still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!",Joey,,,,,
" No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y’know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if we were ever to have kids, well that’s a…",Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!,Joey,,,,,
 What about Game 1 of the Series?,Joey,,,,,
 You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin) I’ll be right back.,Joey,,,,,
 (returning) Hey! You wanna go?,Joey,,,,,
 Okay. See you guys later.,Joey,,,,,
" (whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still… And guess what, I’m thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.",Joey,,,,,
" No-no-no-no-no! It’s a surprise, but it’s gonna be tricky though because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.",Joey,,,,,
 Where are you gettin’ this?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh. Oh.,Joey,,,,,
" No hey Rach, it’s cool okay? Y’know I’m a loner too! (Heads for his room.) Right?",Joey,,,,,
" No! No. Don’t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
 (coming back out) Finally!,Joey,,,,,
 Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.,Joey,,,,,
 Fifty-six!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports team!,Joey,,,,,
" 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?",Joey,,,,,
" (gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.",Joey,,,,,
" But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?",Joey,,,,,
" Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.",Joey,,,,,
 What the hell is in there?,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah that dog left!,Joey,,,,,
 (interrupting him) Don't do it!,Joey,,,,,
 Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.),Joey,,,,,
" Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin’ ice cream.",Joey,,,,,
 Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.),Joey,,,,,
" All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.",Joey,,,,,
" Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.",Joey,,,,,
" (through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!",Joey,,,,,
" (realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachel moves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed)",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that Chandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter?",Joey,,,,,
" So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.",Joey,,,,,
" Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.",Joey,,,,,
" Ross, you need some help?",Joey,,,,,
" (sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.,Joey,,,,,
" If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!,Joey,,,,,
 You think?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" I do. There’s uh, let’s see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I’ve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
" Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might’ve happened to a huge chunk of it.",Joey,,,,,
 Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!,Joey,,,,,
 (about to cry) Those two only had each other!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin’ it by the park.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey Pheebs?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey Rach?,Joey,,,,,
 That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this? (He shows her what he’s been drawing.),Joey,,,,,
" Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford p0rn.",Joey,,,,,
" (watching the discussion) Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah lady! Give us candy!!,Joey,,,,,
 What’s up buddy?,Joey,,,,,
 Waiting for candy.,Joey,,,,,
" (stepping in and knocking the man over) Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!",Joey,,,,,
" That’s right, it’s all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it! (Steps into the apartment and Chandler closes the door.) (Joey struts over to the candy and starts eating it.)",Joey,,,,,
" (with his mouth full) Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don’t know… (Grabs the note.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey. (He exits),Joey,,,,,
" Hey! Great, you’re home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas! (Starts drumming.)",Joey,,,,,
 (yelling) No! Drums!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. (To Rachel) Ready? One, two, three, four...",Joey,,,,,
 Thank you. (He gets up and puts on his jacket.) (Phoebe enters) Hey Pheebs!,Joey,,,,,
 Here. (Gives her the coins) Now I only owe you $49.50.,Joey,,,,,
 What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! (He plays a drum-roll) Okay, what is it?",Joey,,,,,
" Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! (He storms into his room)",Joey,,,,,
 (entering wearing a Superman costume) Merry Christmas!,Joey,,,,,
 (yelling from the bedroom) Is it back in the cage?,Joey,,,,,
 Cage closed?,Joey,,,,,
" All right, I should get going, big day at work. Y’know I’m in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead.",Joey,,,,,
" Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it’s just my character that’s not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?",Joey,,,,,
 I’ll see you at 8:00.,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for s*x!",Joey,,,,,
 Wow! I’m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry. (They hug.) How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself!",Joey,,,,,
 The Ross—Is that back?!! (Chandler motions no.),Joey,,,,,
 Awww! Mel Torme died.,Joey,,,,,
 Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody’s sale is over?!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…",Joey,,,,,
" Aww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 (seeing what they’re doing) What do you got there?,Joey,,,,,
 Huh? Uh… (He starts taking off his pants.),Joey,,,,,
" Oh! (Pulls up his pants.) Sorry. Uh, I’ve got those plans with Phoebe, why?",Joey,,,,,
 What?! Tonight?!,Joey,,,,,
 After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin’ here?",Joey,,,,,
" Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh well, that changes everything! (Grabs his menu and starts looking at it again. The waiter leaves.) Y’know what Pheebs?",Joey,,,,,
" You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.",Joey,,,,,
 Y’know-y’know what I really want?,Joey,,,,,
" Is to have a long, long talk. Y’know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.",Joey,,,,,
 Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.,Joey,,,,,
 What’s the rush? What?,Joey,,,,,
" Whoa-whoa, what is it?",Joey,,,,,
" A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn’t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!",Joey,,,,,
" No, I’m gonna!! That’s right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you’re doing the same thing!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!",Joey,,,,,
" Well, she graduated from high school!",Joey,,,,,
 Fine!,Joey,,,,,
 Fine!,Joey,,,,,
" (to the waiter) What are you still doin’ here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!",Joey,,,,,
" No! No! No Pheebs, I’m not gonna yell at you. I just y’know, started thinking about you and David and I…remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just… Oh Pheebs, come here. (He hugs her.) Are you okay?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, y’know you could always visit him.",Joey,,,,,
 Anything I can do? Whatever you need.,Joey,,,,,
 I can give it a shot.,Joey,,,,,
" (pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin’? (Starts digging in.)",Joey,,,,,
 (looking through his binoculars at a nearby building) Y’know what else makes you wonder?,Joey,,,,,
 Check out the rack on this chick! (Turns around to point it out to Ross and finds that Ross is glaring at him. So he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes and starts looking for the comet.),Joey,,,,,
 Then why are you wearing Monica’s jacket?,Joey,,,,,
 (whispering) Ross!,Joey,,,,,
" Come here, check this out!",Joey,,,,,
" No! No-no. Look, there’s a bug stuck in tar right here. (Bends down to get a closer look.)",Joey,,,,,
" (standing up) Y’know, there’s two women dude.",Joey,,,,,
 Right-right up here. (Starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.),Joey,,,,,
" (annoyed) I don’t know! (Goes back to looking through the pipe.) (Pause) Yeah, I do.",Joey,,,,,
 What?! All right—Hey! Don’t look at me! You’re the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!,Joey,,,,,
 (covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on the door.),Joey,,,,,
 Come on!,Joey,,,,,
" All right well, y’know…I guess we know what we have to do to get down.",Joey,,,,,
 Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. (Points it out.),Joey,,,,,
" All right, it won’t go down any further. It’s stuck.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!,Joey,,,,,
 What if I smack my head on the concrete?,Joey,,,,,
" (looks at the ground and at Ross) I don’t know Ross! I-I tell you what, let’s flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?",Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
" What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I’m not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can’t go if I break my leg.",Joey,,,,,
" Well all right so, it looks like we’re even!",Joey,,,,,
" Man, I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! ""Do you want soup or salad?"" Both! Always order both!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah? Really? No one’s home?,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 All right! Just hurry up!,Joey,,,,,
 I think face to face.,Joey,,,,,
" Face to face, yeah!",Joey,,,,,
 All right.,Joey,,,,,
 (grunting) Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!,Joey,,,,,
" Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, just shimmy down me and drop!",Joey,,,,,
 Hi.,Joey,,,,,
 (angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!,Joey,,,,,
 It’s not that far! Just drop!,Joey,,,,,
" Ross, you should know that my pants are startin’ to come down and I’m not wearing any underwear!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 What are you doing?,Joey,,,,,
 (laughs) Why would you want to do that?,Joey,,,,,
" Rach, there is a decent place to…",Joey,,,,,
 No. No. No.,Joey,,,,,
 No. Rosita does not move.,Joey,,,,,
 As in Rosita does not move.,Joey,,,,,
 The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of off Stevie.,Joey,,,,,
 (glaring at her) Is there a problem?,Joey,,,,,
" I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?",Joey,,,,,
 (slowly turning and glaring at her) She’s not even cold yet!,Joey,,,,,
 That’s true.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I… (Shuts off the TV.) I don’t want Stevie to see her like this.",Joey,,,,,
 No I won’t.,Joey,,,,,
" Because, I know what I like and what I don’t like! It’s not the same thing!",Joey,,,,,
 I don’t know why you say that so soon.,Joey,,,,,
 Francette? What is she? A couch?,Joey,,,,,
 Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I guess you’re right. Maybe, maybe I’ll take her down to the incinerator. It’s gonna be so said, and kinda cool. (He goes to remove the back, but it doesn’t come off. So he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and looks back at it.) She’s heeled!",Joey,,,,,
" No it’s not weird, it’s a miracle!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!",Joey,,,,,
 (interrupting her) Can you tell me how this happened?,Joey,,,,,
 Miracle!,Joey,,,,,
 Someone like an…angel?,Joey,,,,,
 (angrily) Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! (She gets up and heads for her room.),Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, me too. (He flips up his armrest in disgust.)",Joey,,,,,
 Fine.,Joey,,,,,
 No. Really?,Joey,,,,,
 (quietly) My chair heels itself.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, it looks like it wasn’t heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now! (Sits down in it and groans.)",Joey,,,,,
 Your chair?!,Joey,,,,,
" So, there was no miracle?!",Joey,,,,,
 (sarcastic) Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I’m so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.,Joey,,,,,
 How do you figure?,Joey,,,,,
 That’s right!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! We are!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Ahhh…… (To Rachel) Eh?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 They do!,Joey,,,,,
" Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.",Joey,,,,,
 (screaming) Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!! (He buries his head in Phoebe’s lap for comfort.),Joey,,,,,
 (screaming) And now Chandler! We’re all gettin’ so old! (Looking up) Why are you doing this to us?! (Turns away crying.),Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, your roommate is a soap opera star.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, what’s the horsepower on this thing?",Joey,,,,,
 But it hurt’s my Joey’s Apple.,Joey,,,,,
 Well actually…,Joey,,,,,
" Dude, you soooo need this car.",Joey,,,,,
" Yep. (Starts for Monica’s room, but Chandler stops him.)",Joey,,,,,
" Now that you’re a couple, we don’t get two presents from you guys?",Joey,,,,,
 Will you quit hoggin’ it!,Joey,,,,,
 (to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The waiter nods) Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I don’t know Pheebs. It’ll be okay.",Joey,,,,,
 That’s not gonna happen. No. (Looks up) Because we have a new deal!,Joey,,,,,
 Like what?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, y’know what you guys? I think I’m gonna go walk her home. (Gets up and runs out.)",Joey,,,,,
" Pheebs! Wait up! (She stops.) Listen uh, close your eyes. (She does so and Joey passionately kisses her.) Maybe that’s one thing you can cross off your list.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, and plus I’m 1/16th Portuguese.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?",Joey,,,,,
 Okay! (Runs off downstairs.),Joey,,,,,
 Yes!,Joey,,,,,
" (entering, limping, and holding his arm) I don’t like this anymore. (He sits down with them in pain.)",Joey,,,,,
 (crying) Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! (He buries his head in Ross’s shoulder.),Joey,,,,,
 All-all right! (They run and jump in the car.) Start it up! Let’s go!,Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
" (entering, excited) Hey!",Joey,,,,,
" So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and…",Joey,,,,,
" Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you’re not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!",Joey,,,,,
" And-and-and not only that, I’m gettin’ a new brain!!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh well, they’re killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.",Joey,,,,,
" (seriously) Yes, it’s a highly controversial procedure.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I think it’s ridiculous that you haven’t had s*x in three and a half months.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.",Joey,,,,,
 Nice.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, tell me about it. And she’s been on the show forever, it’s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.",Joey,,,,,
" Yes, but in Drake Ramoray’s body. (Ross laughs unbelievably.) Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!",Joey,,,,,
 That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.",Joey,,,,,
 Say what?,Joey,,,,,
" No. No, I’m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I’m the guy in the coma!",Joey,,,,,
" An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me…",Joey,,,,,
 (quickly) I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh uh, one of the writers.",Joey,,,,,
 Umm…,Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
" Ms. Monroe… (She slaps him) Oh there you go. (She storms off, leaving Joey standing next to Dina. They share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they just received.)",Joey,,,,,
 So you like the nachos uh? Myself I’m partial to…,Joey,,,,,
 See you in 2003. (She walks away.),Joey,,,,,
" I’m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.",Joey,,,,,
 No I mean it! I can’t believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!,Joey,,,,,
 Joey.,Joey,,,,,
" Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye—l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I’m really nervous about-about being you. Y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y’know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?",Joey,,,,,
 Oh that’s great! Oh thank you so much!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey! Now, I’ve been watching some tapes, how’s this? (In a British accent.) ""Jessica Lockhart will never set foot in this place again! Ever!!""",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 (shocked) I can do an English accent?! That baby’s going on my résumé!,Joey,,,,,
" Okay! (He scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed) All right!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. Okay. (He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh well—Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y’know? It’ll-it’ll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You’re so talented.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey that’s not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb—Angelina Jolie!",Joey,,,,,
 Like-like what?,Joey,,,,,
 (impressed) Wow!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh hey come on, don’t-don’t-don’t do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I’m thinking, ""Boy, she-she is a great actress!"" (She’s not buying it.) Uh but-but, I am also thinking, ""She is hot!""",Joey,,,,,
 You own the room. (She smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.) We should probably get-get uh…,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that ‘cause she’s so passionate?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! Okay. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.),Joey,,,,,
" Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.",Joey,,,,,
 (shrugs) Sure. Yep.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, bye-bye.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, here we go. (He grabs them and starts to pull them out of the apartment.)",Joey,,,,,
 Thanks for stopping by. See ya! (Throws them out and closes the door.) (To Cecilia) I-I am so sorry. I…,Joey,,,,,
 (notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!,Joey,,,,,
 They sent me today’s script! They never send the script!,Joey,,,,,
" Well no, I’m just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! (Realizes what that means.) Oh…",Joey,,,,,
" (flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah well, I’m guessing after this she’s not going to be crazy about electricity either.",Joey,,,,,
 (as Jessica) I don’t think so.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh noo…,Joey,,,,,
 Thanks!,Joey,,,,,
 Great! Hey! Alright! Well-well what is it?!,Joey,,,,,
 The airport?,Joey,,,,,
" Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?",Joey,,,,,
 That’s a really long time.,Joey,,,,,
" Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. (Realizes.) And I just got what you meant again—That is—I tell ya, that is a tricky one!",Joey,,,,,
 Good luck.,Joey,,,,,
 I call it!!,Joey,,,,,
 Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!,Joey,,,,,
" So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?",Joey,,,,,
 Well then let me do it!,Joey,,,,,
" No-no-no! Look, I’ve been thinking about it. I’m an actor right? So I won’t get nervous talking in front of people.",Joey,,,,,
" No-no-no-no look no! I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts! Y’know? Everyone knows I’m an ass man!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do a really good job. Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.",Joey,,,,,
 So I can do it?,Joey,,,,,
" All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have s*x right?",Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh! My head! Oh! (He’s sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his feet up for Monica to rub.) Oh!",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! (Holds up the piece of paper bearing the proof of his ordination.),Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of p0rn out there!",Joey,,,,,
" Anyway, I started working on what I’m going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?",Joey,,,,,
" Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so… (Starts to read the piece of paper he brought.) ""We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share."" (Monica and Chandler like it so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) ""It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving."" (Phoebe nods her approval.) ""We too can share and love and have and receive.""",Joey,,,,,
" Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?",Joey,,,,,
" (reading) ""When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and…"" And then I can’t think of a good word for right here. (He points to the stop on the paper where he left off.)",Joey,,,,,
 Yes!,Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?",Joey,,,,,
" I gotcha. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I’ll talk about London! Y’know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won’t say hooked up. I’ll say, ""Began their beautiful journey…""",Joey,,,,,
" ""…by doin’ it.""",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y’know you’re in the bathtub together and she’s feeding you strawberries?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!! I call that London style.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah baby!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah baby!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, dude I’m so sorry!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey no-no-no-no! It’s cool! It’s cool! I-I’ll only be a second, I’m still with my bridesmaid, I just—Where are those condoms you brought?",Joey,,,,,
 Ah. (Joey walks to Chandler’s bag by getting as far away from Chandler’s bed as possible.),Joey,,,,,
 (pause) For just you?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey listen, why don’t you come downstairs with me? There’s some really nice girls down there.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)",Joey,,,,,
" That’s what that was?! ‘Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh… (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I hadn’t left you that last one? You two might’ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It’s like it was in the stars!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah baby! (Chandler glares at him.) No baby!,Joey,,,,,
 And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv—(Shuts up on Monica’s glare.),Joey,,,,,
" Hey! (Monica turns and looks at him) Now I’m a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!",Joey,,,,,
" What?! That’s not fair! It’s not my fault! I was off with my bridesmaid! And who’s to say I would’ve even said yes?! (To Monica) I mean I would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way too big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!",Joey,,,,,
 This is crazy.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Chandler, come on nothing even happened!",Joey,,,,,
" No-hey-no! If you don’t want me to do it, I accept that. I don’t care about that. I just…I don’t want you to be upset.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You’re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever.",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 Really? I can do it?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! (They hug.),Joey,,,,,
" Well I don’t know if I remember exactly but, it’s-it’s pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 So are guys doing okay?,Joey,,,,,
" Ho-ho-ho, (pausing for a rest next to the fridge) fried stuff with cheese!",Joey,,,,,
 Here you go.,Joey,,,,,
 Good for you!,Joey,,,,,
 Food? Uh-huh gimme! (She hands him the paper.),Joey,,,,,
" This is impossible Monica, why don’t you just pick all 15? (Hands back the paper.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, I added three.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah… (He mimes sticking his fingers into a jar of peanut butter, scooping some out, and eating it off his fingers.)",Joey,,,,,
" (checking her out) Hi! You uh, movin’ in or movin’ out?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh uh, can I give you a hand?",Joey,,,,,
 Boyfriend?,Joey,,,,,
 I’m Joey. (They shake hands.),Joey,,,,,
" Oh wow, what a beautiful name! (Pause) What is it again?",Joey,,,,,
 Got it! (He picks up a lamp.) So…,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. (Points.) Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop (Points to hers) or you can wake up with your shoes gone.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?",Joey,,,,,
 Oh.,Joey,,,,,
" Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go? (The lamp he’s holding.)",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. Yeah. (She leaves and he goes to pick up a box marked books, but decides to take the box marked pillows instead.) Yeah, I’ll grab this one. (He follows her upstairs.)",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey Chandler!,Joey,,,,,
" Listen, sorry I didn’t stop by last night but I had a date.",Joey,,,,,
" Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 Two days ago.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh yeah?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I’m dating this girl who’s also seeing another guy. But, I don’t know, I’m not too worried about it.",Joey,,,,,
" Obviously! So, how do we decide?",Joey,,,,,
" (not buying it) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I’m the one who dates her.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction…,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah well we should order some food then.,Joey,,,,,
 (smiling) That sounds fair.,Joey,,,,,
 Ah yeah—wait a second now! Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.,Joey,,,,,
" All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. Uh, (thinks)…a slice…(Thinks)…six dollars?",Joey,,,,,
 Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" I just wanted to come by and y’know, wish you good luck on your date.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. What time are you meeting her?,Joey,,,,,
" Wow, that’s in like 20 minutes. You’d better get dressed.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh. Well good! (To himself) For me. (He picks up a jar of lotion.) What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?,Joey,,,,,
" Okay dude! (Finds a receipt.) Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.",Joey,,,,,
 You spent a hundred dollars. That’s the limit. You’re screwed!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y’know!,Joey,,,,,
 I don’t know.,Joey,,,,,
 Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this!,Joey,,,,,
 Well we’ll see!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah bye-bye! (Exits and comes back in still holding the lotion.) Hey! So just a light layer?,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Kristen?,Joey,,,,,
 Hi!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I’m not breaking any rules so I…",Joey,,,,,
 Hi!,Joey,,,,,
 Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! (Sits down.),Joey,,,,,
 A woman in a man’s body.,Joey,,,,,
" So y’know Ross it’s funny ‘cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?",Joey,,,,,
 So you’ve just married the one time then?,Joey,,,,,
" (laughs that one off) Yeah. So uh Ross, well now—why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?",Joey,,,,,
 No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.,Joey,,,,,
 Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!,Joey,,,,,
 Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!,Joey,,,,,
 Monkey lover!,Joey,,,,,
 When do you think we lost her?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! (Monica goes in the bedroom.) Y’know, she could use a little…(Whistles that she needs to do what they’re doing.) (Something happens on the game.) Oh nice shot!!! (They all cheer.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! You guys! You’re not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent…,Joey,,,,,
 Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!,Joey,,,,,
 No-no.,Joey,,,,,
 No! I’m up for a Soapie!,Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no! It’s real! And it has been since 1998. (Rachel returns from the bathroom.) Hey Rach! Rach! I’m up for a Soapie!",Joey,,,,,
" Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I’m taking to the awards. (Points to Rachel.)",Joey,,,,,
 Many are scheduled to appear.,Joey,,,,,
" (pretending to be an announcer) And the winner is…Joey Tribbiani! (He then gets excited and goes over to the counter to practice his acceptance speech using a bottle of maple syrup as the award.) Oh… Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn’t prepare a speech. But umm, I’d like to thank (Rachel enters quietly) my parents, who’ve always been there for me. I’d also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel…",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah may-maybe you don’t tell anyone about this.,Joey,,,,,
 Really?,Joey,,,,,
 What award are you practicing for?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, hey listen! The Soapie’s called today and I also get to present an award.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 (confused) What you-you don’t think I’m gonna win?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it’s just…I’ve never even been nominated before! I want it so much.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! (Likes it.),Joey,,,,,
 You practice losing the Grammies too?,Joey,,,,,
 Ah.,Joey,,,,,
 Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?,Joey,,,,,
 Whoa!,Joey,,,,,
 Ross has a boyfriend.,Joey,,,,,
 How’d you get over that teacher?,Joey,,,,,
 (To Ross) Problem solved.,Joey,,,,,
 (To Rachel) This is it! This is my category.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I got my speech!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. (Does it.),Joey,,,,,
 Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?,Joey,,,,,
 ‘Kay!,Joey,,,,,
" What the?! (Joey pounds the table and starts yelling at Rachel, and which is drowned out by applause. Rachel is desperately trying to tell Joey that he’s on TV right now. He finally notices and he does his gracious loser face.)",Joey,,,,,
" (angrily and monotone) Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. (Shakes his head in disgust.) The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. (There is applause, which Joey disgustedly waits to dye out.) From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop (They start to applaud again, but Joey interrupts in with the rest of the nominees), from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is…(Opens the envelope)…Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. (Applause) Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn’t be with us tonight so I’ll be accepting this award on her behalf. (Realizes something) And I’m sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She’d also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who’s sittin’ right there! (Points at Rachel.) (The music starts and his microphone is turned off, this angers Joey again and he disgustedly exits.)",Joey,,,,,
" Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won! (He whips out the award for Best Supporting Actress that he accepted for Jessica.)",Joey,,,,,
" No-no! No, I’m accepting it on her behalf. (He puts it up above the TV to display it.)",Joey,,,,,
" Sure I do! It’s a verb! As in, ""I behalfin’ it!""",Joey,,,,,
 But why?! I should’ve won one and I really want it and she didn’t even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.,Joey,,,,,
 Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of ‘em.,Joey,,,,,
" No! I want an award I did win! But nobody’s giving me any of those! Plus—Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there (Points to the TV) right? When people come over they’ll see it and they’ll think I won it.",Joey,,,,,
 I can scratch that right off.,Joey,,,,,
 All right!,Joey,,,,,
 I’ll take it back tomorrow.,Joey,,,,,
 (opening his door) If I can’t have it you can’t have it! (Rachel walks away angrily.),Joey,,,,,
 Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey Jessica.,Joey,,,,,
" Ah, this is my friend Rachel.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh listen, here’s your Soapie. I accepted it for ya. (Hands it to her.)",Joey,,,,,
" Well, that-that-that’s it? You’re gonna, you’re gonna put it on your self or anything?",Joey,,,,,
 (To Rachel) Take it back?,Joey,,,,,
" Y-y-yeah! (As they start to leave, Rachel pauses and steals a vase with flowers in it.) Yeah you do. (They exit.)",Joey,,,,,
" I’m sorry, do I know you?",Joey,,,,,
" Nothing, I’m just practicing blowing you off because I’m gonna be a big movie star!",Joey,,,,,
" Well no, not yet. But the audition went really good.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, it’s this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It’s really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next next Martin Scorcese.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, there’s this guy from Chicago who’s supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy’s right after him. (Joey’s cell phone rings and he answers it.) Hello!",Joey,,,,,
 (to Monica and Phoebe) They loved me!,Joey,,,,,
 (on phone) Oh my God!,Joey,,,,,
" Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Uh, okay uh let me call you back. (Hangs up.)",Joey,,,,,
 They want me to be totally naked in the movie!,Joey,,,,,
 I know! My grandmother’s gonna see this!,Joey,,,,,
" I don’t know! It’s not like it’s p0rn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y’know? And the nudity is really important to the story.",Joey,,,,,
 You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back.,Joey,,,,,
 Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I’m back!",Joey,,,,,
" Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh great! Y’know I would’ve been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y’know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day! (Starts to leave.)",Joey,,,,,
 And scene! Huh? Wasn’t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?,Joey,,,,,
 Wow! Sure! That’s great!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! Yeah sure, just so long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.",Joey,,,,,
 So…What?,Joey,,,,,
 Yes!,Joey,,,,,
 No. What?,Joey,,,,,
 Barmitsvahed?,Joey,,,,,
 Nope.,Joey,,,,,
 Yep.,Joey,,,,,
 That’s right.,Joey,,,,,
" I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.",Joey,,,,,
 I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.,Joey,,,,,
 I just have to call my agent and tell her I can’t do the part. (Gets up for the phone.),Joey,,,,,
 Unless what?,Joey,,,,,
 Like what?,Joey,,,,,
 Wow! This looks great!,Joey,,,,,
 And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?,Joey,,,,,
 Thank God!,Joey,,,,,
 Ah.,Joey,,,,,
 Well maybe we just take that one away. (Picks it up and throws it away.),Joey,,,,,
" Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.",Joey,,,,,
 Ow!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 The fruit roll up.,Joey,,,,,
 Delicious.,Joey,,,,,
 Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!,Joey,,,,,
 The Silly Putty! It’s not so silly anymore!,Joey,,,,,
" And what’s cool is, the character is from Naples, right?",Joey,,,,,
 My whole family’s from Naples!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. (He starts taking off his clothes.) I totally understand. You need to y’know make sure I don’t have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don’t you worry; I have nothing to hide. (He drops his pants and stands, back up and looks down.) So there you go, that’s me. (We cut to a camera angle looking at the casting director and movie director through Joey’s legs.) One hundred percent natural! (Suddenly, there’s a thud as something falls off.) (Everyone is shocked.) I tell ya, that has never happened before.",Joey,,,,,
 Probably Monica and Chandler.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey guys! Look who’s back! It’s Ray-ray!,Joey,,,,,
 (excitedly) Who you what? Who you what?!,Joey,,,,,
 (excitedly) Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you—what?!!,Joey,,,,,
 What?!,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hello!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey Rach. (Stares at her.),Joey,,,,,
" Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?",Joey,,,,,
" What, they’re not invited?! Oh no, that’s terrible! They’re gonna be crushed!",Joey,,,,,
 (looking around) You got me. I don’t…,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I’m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y’know? Your parents are comin’! Chandler’s parents are comin’! Ross’s parents are comin’!",Joey,,,,,
 Well-well—see? Parents are comin’!,Joey,,,,,
 (leaning down to her) Maybe you’ll order a little sangria?,Joey,,,,,
 We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.),Joey,,,,,
 Nice move.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" No, I’m performing the ceremony. I’m not wearing a tux.",Joey,,,,,
" Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.",Joey,,,,,
 I don’t think so.,Joey,,,,,
 (excitedly) Can I come?! I won’t even talk! You’ll just hear the noise from my video camera.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!,Joey,,,,,
 Okay…,Joey,,,,,
" Hey. (Laughs, then seriously) It happened!",Joey,,,,,
 Why are you taking this away from me?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, they’re not coming.",Joey,,,,,
 Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They…feel a little unwanted.,Joey,,,,,
" Look Mon, if you could just call my mom…",Joey,,,,,
" Come on! Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them to be there. Let’s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.",Joey,,,,,
 Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?,Joey,,,,,
" I don’t know. Just uh, just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or—No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don’t think you can blame it on them, so… (He dials the phone and hands it to Monica.)",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?",Joey,,,,,
" Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it’s gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?",Joey,,,,,
" Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it’s the same day as my niece’s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. ‘Cause my part’s just in the beginning I’m not even in the rest of the show—Wedding!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little ‘til they get there?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! Yeah y’know, like warm up the crowd. Ask ‘em where they’re from. ‘Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I’m a minis-tainer! (Rapping) There is no-one better! There is no-one greater!",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?",Joey,,,,,
" No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They’re so happy they get to be a part of your special day.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! (Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party time.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, uh… (To Ross) Oh hey, you’ve done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, ""Monica…",Joey,,,,,
" ""…when I look back over our time together…""",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I can’t do everything! Look back over your time together.",Joey,,,,,
 (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" How is ""Monica, I love your sweet ass,"" inappropriate?",Joey,,,,,
 (shocked) Has it been that long?!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!",Joey,,,,,
" Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?",Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 I know! I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it.,Joey,,,,,
 (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!,Joey,,,,,
 How?! When?!,Joey,,,,,
 IN LONDON!!!,Joey,,,,,
 But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!,Joey,,,,,
" All right! Man, this is unbelievable!",Joey,,,,,
" Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!",Joey,,,,,
 Well I didn't tell them!,Joey,,,,,
" Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.",Joey,,,,,
 And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!,Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
 They know you know.,Joey,,,,,
 I couldn't even if I wanted to.,Joey,,,,,
 (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!,Joey,,,,,
 Ooh!,Joey,,,,,
" I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)",Joey,,,,,
 It's not my first time.,Joey,,,,,
  So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!,Joey,,,,,
 I don’t want them to move to a Volvo dealership!,Joey,,,,,
" I’m sorry, I just…I like things the way they are.",Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that’s what you really want.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 (To Chandler) (laughing) Funny one! That’s good!,Joey,,,,,
 What? I don’t get it.,Joey,,,,,
 (starting to cry) I have never known love like this.,Joey,,,,,
 If he goes first he can!,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin’ good. When do I get to take that baby out again?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, you got a couple hours?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?,Joey,,,,,
" Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.",Joey,,,,,
" So uh, what’s your name?",Joey,,,,,
" Joey. (They shake hands.) Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?",Joey,,,,,
" Me too! There’s a game on Tuesday, do you wanna go?",Joey,,,,,
 Pheebs!,Joey,,,,,
" Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh. (Laughs.) No! No wait, that’s weird!",Joey,,,,,
 That’s weird!,Joey,,,,,
 That’s…kinda hot.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.,Joey,,,,,
" You’ve seen my huge stack of p0rn, right? (Phoebe nods.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.),Joey,,,,,
" Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe that he’s got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!",Joey,,,,,
" Y’know, I’m beginning to see what Jake was talking about.",Joey,,,,,
 The silk? Feels really good!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! And-and things aren’t as…smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men’s underwear!,Joey,,,,,
" Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You’ve got cotton, silk, lace! And y’know what I’ve always wondered about?",Joey,,,,,
 Pantyhose! Y’know? The way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here… (He mimed that and stops when he realizes he went too far.) I should go take these off shouldn’t I?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! Okay! (He notices a beautiful woman sitting behind the couch and goes to talk to her.) Hey! Hi!,Joey,,,,,
" Y’know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?",Joey,,,,,
 Oh! Maybe it’s because I’m on television. I’m an actor on Days of Our Lives.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Hm-mmm.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, let me get this. (He takes out his wallet, but the panties come with it. The woman and waitress are shocked.) (Realizing) (To the woman) These are for you.",Joey,,,,,
" No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure! (They all exit.)",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn’t get the part?,Joey,,,,,
 No!,Joey,,,,,
 No!,Joey,,,,,
 Nooo!,Joey,,,,,
 Yes!!,Joey,,,,,
" Yes, that’s the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!",Joey,,,,,
" Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh no, I’ll be done by then.",Joey,,,,,
" I know! All right, I’ll see you guys over there! I’m off to fight the Nazis.",Joey,,,,,
" Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I? (Rachel pauses as she thinks.)",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! Me too. (He pats his pocket.),Joey,,,,,
 I’m doing my scenes with you?,Joey,,,,,
 Wow! I can’t believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!,Joey,,,,,
 I think you did.,Joey,,,,,
 Uh…Cookie?,Joey,,,,,
 We have to find the rest of the platoon!,Joey,,,,,
 (wiping his face) What?!,Joey,,,,,
 (wipes face) So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!,Joey,,,,,
" (glances at Richard) No. Nope, I uh…I th—I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y’know? He’s uh, he’s a face toucher. (Behind his back, Richard is nodding no.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! Where have you been?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won’t get spit in the eyes, y’know?",Joey,,,,,
 Great! All right. I’ll see you later. (He starts to leave.),Joey,,,,,
" Uh, I think he’s in Rachel’s room. See ya. (Exits.)",Joey,,,,,
 Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!,Joey,,,,,
 Alright.,Joey,,,,,
 Picture? What picture?,Joey,,,,,
" Okay uh, look I know you’re a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff…",Joey,,,,,
 But you’re spittin’ all over me man!,Joey,,,,,
 You know you’ve been spitting on me?!,Joey,,,,,
 (wiping face) Wow! Didn’t know that.,Joey,,,,,
 Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! (Reading from the script) Picture? What picture? (He pauses then spits) Eh?,Joey,,,,,
 What picture?!,Joey,,,,,
 You went through my personal property?,Joey,,,,,
" (pause) Because Vincent, we were lovers. (Pause) For two years!",Joey,,,,,
 Great scene yeah?,Joey,,,,,
 Thanks a lot.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I’m-I’m not working tomorrow.",Joey,,,,,
 No! No! I can’t! You gotta get me out of it! I’ve got plans! (Spits.) Important plans! (Spits on the Ps.),Joey,,,,,
" Excuse me, Aaron? (The director turns around.) Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn’t supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It’s my best friend’s, and I’m officiating so I really can’t work past four.",Joey,,,,,
 I’m having surgery!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn’t want you to worry about me. But, I’m having surgery today.",Joey,,,,,
 Transplant.,Joey,,,,,
 Hair transplant.,Joey,,,,,
 It’s not on my head.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey! You’re here! Great! Great! Great! Let’s get going buddy, we’ve got a scene to shoot!",Joey,,,,,
 Are you drunk?,Joey,,,,,
 Yes you are!,Joey,,,,,
 I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!,Joey,,,,,
 What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!,Joey,,,,,
" Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I’m the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?",Joey,,,,,
 Thank you. Thank you.,Joey,,,,,
 I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!,Joey,,,,,
 (on phone) Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?,Joey,,,,,
 Damnit!,Joey,,,,,
 I’m still on the set!,Joey,,,,,
" I know! I’m sorry! The guy’s drunk, they won’t let me go until we get this.",Joey,,,,,
" No! No, I’m the minister! Alright, look-look, put ‘em both on the phone, I’ll marry them right now.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! Don’t you hang up on me! I’ll marry you and me right now! I have the power!,Joey,,,,,
 Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy’s hammered!,Joey,,,,,
" So I uh, I just talked to the director. That’s it, we’re done for the day.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! You…you were wonderful.,Joey,,,,,
" So I got your car, it’s right outside.",Joey,,,,,
 That’s what you told me.,Joey,,,,,
 No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! (Joey picks him up in a fireman’s carry and carries him out.) Here we go.,Joey,,,,,
" (entering) That’s my line! (He walks up the aisle and to the rabbi) I can take it from here, thanks. (To all) Dearly beloved, I’m sorry I’m a little late. You may be confused by this now, (He’s still in costume) but you won’t be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let’s get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? (Monica is shocked and looks around.) We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I’ve known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I’ve left my notes in my dressing room, we shall proceed to the vows. Monica?",Joey,,,,,
 Chandler?,Joey,,,,,
" You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in me by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah you do!,Joey,,,,,
 Aw crap! Okay—uh…uh let’s-let’s do the rings.,Joey,,,,,
" We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. (To Chandler) Now kiss her again.",Joey,,,,,
 What? What’s going on?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!,Joey,,,,,
 Ah. (To Chandler) Slow swimmers? (Chandler looks at him.),Joey,,,,,
 I can’t! I-I don’t have any other clothes here.,Joey,,,,,
" I’m sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it’s either this or a bathrobe! Look, what’s more important, the way I’m dressed or me being with you on your special day?",Joey,,,,,
" That’s better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. (They do a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)",Joey,,,,,
" I don’t believe we’ve met, Joey Tribbiani.",Joey,,,,,
" Wow, I’ve admired your work for years. You-you’ve done some really amazing stuff.",Joey,,,,,
 Wow Dennis Phillips! That’s great! How did you guys meet?,Joey,,,,,
" Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? ‘Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would’ve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that’s just for ugly people.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, I don’t even really know where I left those. Sorry.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay fine! I’m a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I’ll show ya!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?,Joey,,,,,
 No-no! No! No! You don’t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I’m a soap actor.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" (clinks his glass) I’d like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly angry) ""Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!"" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and there was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) I’m sorry. And-and some scared memories—Whoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized I’ll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!",Joey,,,,,
" So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I’d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you’re casting for this new show…",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, see that’s where you’re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn’t see it up there, just-just try me.",Joey,,,,,
" Well I’m not proud of this, but… (He turns around and starts to mess with his eyelids.)",Joey,,,,,
" Shh. Shh. Don’t try to talk, we’ll get you up to your room, we’ll soak your feet, you’ll be okay.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Tell me about it, I feel like I’m holding down the fort all by myself.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 No. (Phoebe grabs the receipt and shows it to Joey who gets mad.) I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!,Joey,,,,,
 Nothing! It was something.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, that’s sad. Mashuga nut?",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 (warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.) Is somebody pregnant?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh my God Pheebs! You’re gonna have a baby?,Joey,,,,,
" Whoa, wait a minute. Who’s the father?",Joey,,,,,
 Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!,Joey,,,,,
 David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! (Exits),Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?,Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 Okay. (Hands her one.),Joey,,,,,
" Oh good, uh you’re here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say.",Joey,,,,,
" Umm, now uh… It’s a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y’know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so… (He goes to one knee and pulls out a ring.) Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?",Joey,,,,,
 Why?! Why can’t she marry me?!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh my God.,Joey,,,,,
 (smiles then stops) Now I can’t believe it! What? Rachel’s pregnant? (The girls nod yes.) Who’s the father?,Joey,,,,,
 Ohh… I wonder if that dude.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn’t see who it was but… (He walks out and closes the door.)",Joey,,,,,
 The guy left this.,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) You opened them all?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh hey! You got my parent’s gift! (Holds it up.),Joey,,,,,
" Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. What-what did Tag say?,Joey,,,,,
" I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. (They hug.)",Joey,,,,,
" Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you’re not gonna be alone in this.",Joey,,,,,
" Listen I uh… (He takes her hand.) It’s a scary world out there especially if you’re a single mom. Y’know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y’know? So, (gets down on one knee again) Rachel Green will you marry me?",Joey,,,,,
" Pheebs, give me the ring back!",Joey,,,,,
 (heartbroken) I understand.,Joey,,,,,
" Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered…",Joey,,,,,
 There you go!,Joey,,,,,
 (slow on the uptake) Oh my God!,Joey,,,,,
 (entering with Phoebe) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 We know its Ross!,Joey,,,,,
 I’m gonna be an uncle! Come here! (He joins the hug.),Joey,,,,,
" Well that, that sounds good.",Joey,,,,,
 Bye.,Joey,,,,,
 What secrets?,Joey,,,,,
 (whispering to Chandler) You’ll tell me later?,Joey,,,,,
" Y’know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.",Joey,,,,,
" I don’t have a key, they took mine to give to you.",Joey,,,,,
 Why would they take away our keys?,Joey,,,,,
 No that’s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I washed those!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah that didn’t sound like me.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I have stuff in there too.",Joey,,,,,
" Monica’s chicken parm! I’ll take care of it. (He picks up the phone) Hey Mr. Treeger, it’s Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler’s apartment. It’s an emergency. (Listens) Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread. (Hangs up.)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, it seemed pretty important.",Joey,,,,,
 Really?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I don’t think that’s what it is.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh wow, I don’t feel well.",Joey,,,,,
" Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.",Joey,,,,,
 I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.,Joey,,,,,
 What the hell is that?,Joey,,,,,
" Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?",Joey,,,,,
 (eating) Huh. So then I can heat this up? (Goes and does so.),Joey,,,,,
 So it’s noticeable huh?,Joey,,,,,
 (simultaneously) Oh my God!!! I can’t believe that!!,Joey,,,,,
 How are you doing?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, what did you say to her?",Joey,,,,,
 (shocked) What?,Joey,,,,,
 Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don’t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!,Joey,,,,,
 What?! (Grabs his condoms from his pocket and looks.),Joey,,,,,
" Hey Monica it’s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin’ from your apartment.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah and we’d go check it out, but you took away our keys.",Joey,,,,,
 How? I guess I could break down your door.,Joey,,,,,
 And-and you won’t blame us for any damage? (Gives Phoebe a thumbs up.),Joey,,,,,
" Uh, okay I’ll-I’ll-I’ll break it down. (He hands the phone to Phoebe, gets up, picks up a chair, and starts banging it on the floor.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 I don’t see the baby. Where is it?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! You’re back! (Hugs and kisses all around.),Joey,,,,,
" A couple? Like two people? Like (points to himself) one (points to Phoebe), two people?",Joey,,,,,
 Y’know what? Why don’t you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?,Joey,,,,,
 Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!,Joey,,,,,
 You’re welcome buddy.,Joey,,,,,
 Whom. (Everyone looks at him shocked.) That’s right.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin’ to that place.",Joey,,,,,
 All right! I’ll have a sandwich!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh I think we do.,Joey,,,,,
" Y’know what? Don’t worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.",Joey,,,,,
 Personal thing? What personal thing? I don’t know.,Joey,,,,,
 (laughs) Yeah I knew what you were talkin’ about.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?",Joey,,,,,
" Whoa, for like months?",Joey,,,,,
 Six months? Whoa that’s rough.,Joey,,,,,
 The sky’s blue Ross and I had s*x yesterday!,Joey,,,,,
" Okay. Okay. Umm…Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It’s this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they’re like putty.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. Now you’re gonna want to have s*x with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. (Clears throat) Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe…",Joey,,,,,
 Have a nice six more months Ross! (Starts to leave.),Joey,,,,,
" I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. (Whispering) It was dead silent. Gorgeous. (Softly) And across the lake I saw…a beautiful woman…bathing herself…but she was crying…",Joey,,,,,
 Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey! Look, if it didn’t work it’s because you didn’t tell it right! Show me how you did it.",Joey,,,,,
 How long since you’ve seen a girl naked?,Joey,,,,,
 I’m not feeling it.,Joey,,,,,
 No! No! No Ross! I’m not hot! Are you hot?,Joey,,,,,
" Well you’re not selling the story! It’s like; it’s like you don’t believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I’m preparing for an audition. Okay? I’ll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you’re doing wrong.",Joey,,,,,
" All right now… All right, you’re all set up. You’re good to go. Just hit record. All right?",Joey,,,,,
 Good luck.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
 (trying not to laugh) That means a lot to me man. (Exits.),Joey,,,,,
 Y’know what? This is not fair to her. Let’s just forget the tape!,Joey,,,,,
" You’re right. (Mouths, ""I know you’ll show me, right?)",Joey,,,,,
" Loud and clear! (Mouths, ""You’ll show me,"" and nods.)",Joey,,,,,
" Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh no Rach, he’s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.",Joey,,,,,
 (confused) Are we watchin’ the tape or not?!,Joey,,,,,
 (To Phoebe) I’m so happy!,Joey,,,,,
 How do you know about that story?!,Joey,,,,,
 (raises his hand) Some guy!! (Points to himself.),Joey,,,,,
 (raises his hand and points to himself again) Ken Adams!!,Joey,,,,,
" (To Rachel) Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.",Joey,,,,,
" I’m not telling, you’ll have to see it on TV!",Joey,,,,,
" No, couldn’t care less.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey you too!,Joey,,,,,
 What? You weren’t in it.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?",Joey,,,,,
" This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.",Joey,,,,,
 (grabbing her) Here we go! Here we go! (Starts to pull her away from Kash.),Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go out with him.",Joey,,,,,
 I said no.,Joey,,,,,
 What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re not gonna be seeing people.,Joey,,,,,
 I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.,Joey,,,,,
" Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great…",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 No. No. But I’ll go see a normal person movie with ya.,Joey,,,,,
 It’s no Ukrainian film.,Joey,,,,,
 I set her up with this actor on my show.,Joey,,,,,
 No,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! I’m an (does the quote-marks thing as well) actor too! I’m not sure. I think they’re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.,Joey,,,,,
 Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.",Joey,,,,,
 So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.,Joey,,,,,
" All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough!",Joey,,,,,
 And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?,Joey,,,,,
 Dude! What is going on?!,Joey,,,,,
 Why?,Joey,,,,,
 They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you!,Joey,,,,,
" Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?",Joey,,,,,
 What do you mean?,Joey,,,,,
 That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?",Joey,,,,,
" Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel.",Joey,,,,,
" I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants.",Joey,,,,,
" That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!",Joey,,,,,
" No, I said fun!",Joey,,,,,
" Look, I’ll come to the party but I’m not dressing up.",Joey,,,,,
" No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you’re not…",Joey,,,,,
 That hot girl from their wedding?,Joey,,,,,
" Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh—Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre—No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface.",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Yes I did! I’m Chandler. (Looks at Chandler) Dude, what happened?",Joey,,,,,
 Okay. I’m Chandler (makes a growling/gurgling sound at the end and the girls laugh.),Joey,,,,,
 When have I ever done that?! (And does the sound again.),Joey,,,,,
" (sees Ross) Hey all right, Ross came as doody.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Exclusively.,Joey,,,,,
" Catwoman, hands down.",Joey,,,,,
" But between you and Phoebe, I’d have to give the edge to Phoebe.",Joey,,,,,
" Are you kiddin’? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she’s got this crazy temper. She—She’s not standing right behind me is she?",Joey,,,,,
 I’m not sure.,Joey,,,,,
 Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn’t matter.,Joey,,,,,
" I would say, ""Woman, please!""",Joey,,,,,
 (To Monica) Here comes the temper.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, here’s a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler.",Joey,,,,,
 So Ross?,Joey,,,,,
" (To Monica) Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.",Joey,,,,,
" Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?",Joey,,,,,
 So you think Ross too?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey Monica! (Grabs her and pulls her into the living room.) People came to see a fight, let’s give ‘em what they came for!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.,Joey,,,,,
" Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.",Joey,,,,,
 Rach?,Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We’re waiting! (They go inside.) (To Chandler and Ross.) Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. (They grasp each other’s hand in preparation for battle.) Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?",Joey,,,,,
" (laughing) Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!",Joey,,,,,
 Or equally weak.,Joey,,,,,
 (to her) You’re a weird lady.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 That’s not so bad.,Joey,,,,,
" Come on! You’re good with kids. They’re just crazy on Halloween. Y’know, they’re all greedy and hopped up on sugar!",Joey,,,,,
" Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas…and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they’re hungry or sleepy. Y’know, kids are tough. Good luck with that. (Walks away.)",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?",Joey,,,,,
" (laughs) No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.",Joey,,,,,
" All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.",Joey,,,,,
" To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you’re not gonna be on TV!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, you’re switching apartments?",Joey,,,,,
 But Rachel has an apartment.,Joey,,,,,
 She is?,Joey,,,,,
 I guess I didn’t really think about it.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, okay. I…I ate way too much.",Joey,,,,,
" Ooh. (Notices the pizza, grabs a slice, and takes a bite.) So umm, I was talkin’ to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.",Joey,,,,,
 I was kinda hoping you’d stay.,Joey,,,,,
" No room? It’s a baby. It’s like this big. (Holds his hands about a foot apart.) Y’know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. (A desk.) Or-or-or we could put it right here. (The chair.) Aw, it’s cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. (By the bathroom door.) You wouldn’t even notice it. Where’s the baby? (Mumbles that it’s over in the corner.)",Joey,,,,,
 I could use a challenge! It’s getting pretty easy.,Joey,,,,,
 I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn’t have to change.,Joey,,,,,
 Y’know I blame Ross for this.,Joey,,,,,
" I’m gonna miss you, you’re the hottest roommate I ever had.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, (In front of the crib.) so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh—Oh look! Here’s a baby monitor (Holds it up), which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?",Joey,,,,,
" Ahhhhhhhhhhhh…. That-that-that’s really just to show where the baby would go. Y’know why don’t I hold on to him so that there’s no confusion? (Takes him back, sets him on the chair, and apologizes to him.)",Joey,,,,,
 I’m loud!,Joey,,,,,
 I’m up all night!,Joey,,,,,
 Hello!,Joey,,,,,
" Look, if I’m bringing home a woman who can’t stand being around a baby, then maybe I don’t want to be with that woman! Or maybe we’ll just do it in the bathroom of the club!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! All right—Look, I know sometimes it’ll be hard, okay? But, it’ll also be really…really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.",Joey,,,,,
 Ohh!,Joey,,,,,
 I know! I found it on the street.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 I don’t know.,Joey,,,,,
 Ew.,Joey,,,,,
 Ooh! Ah! Okay! (Quickly drags the crib outside.),Joey,,,,,
 Isn’t that great?,Joey,,,,,
 It’s a grand tradition!,Joey,,,,,
" This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn’t allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.",Joey,,,,,
" So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How’s it going?",Joey,,,,,
 Hot?,Joey,,,,,
 I’m gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.,Joey,,,,,
 Will you let the lady talk?!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 (on cell phone) I’m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby…,Joey,,,,,
" So you uh, nervous about getting married?",Joey,,,,,
" Look, look let’s pretend it’s a real bachelor party. Okay? Y’know? Before your wedding. Come on, it’ll be fun.",Joey,,,,,
 How does it feel knowing you’re never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you’re gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.,Joey,,,,,
" That’s her! Okay, come on! (They go over and open the door.)",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, that-that’s-that’s me!",Joey,,,,,
" Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.",Joey,,,,,
 Why-why would she go in the bedroom?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, that’s one naked hooker!",Joey,,,,,
" Wait! Wait! Maybe she’s a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she’s supposed to do.",Joey,,,,,
" Maybe Monica’s playing a joke on ya. Y’know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that’s pretty funny.",Joey,,,,,
 I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.,Joey,,,,,
 (on machine) Hey Ross. It’s Joey. There’s a hooker over here and we thought maybe you’d know something about it.,Joey,,,,,
 Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.,Joey,,,,,
" Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you’re really bad at y’know, sexually?",Joey,,,,,
 In a minute!,Joey,,,,,
" All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! It’s your bachelor party.,Joey,,,,,
 I don’t want to. You do it!,Joey,,,,,
 You do it!,Joey,,,,,
 I miss this.,Joey,,,,,
" No, I-I miss hanging out with you.",Joey,,,,,
 Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y’know now it’s like…things are different.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh sure—And hey, don’t get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just…I miss…hanging out…just-just us, y’know?",Joey,,,,,
 You got it. Come here. (They hug and are observed by the hooker.),Joey,,,,,
 (on phone) Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions! (Listens) What gives you the right to… (Listens) Go to hell! (Hangs up the phone and opens the fridge.) Stupid guy on my phone.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.",Joey,,,,,
 (laughing) You fall for it every time!,Joey,,,,,
 I just want you to say it once in a while.,Joey,,,,,
 What?!,Joey,,,,,
 Phoebe!,Joey,,,,,
 No they’re not! They’re ugly and stupid and delicious!,Joey,,,,,
 She is?,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.,Joey,,,,,
" But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!",Joey,,,,,
 No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!,Joey,,,,,
" That’s right! ‘Cause I’m a Tribbiani! (To Rachel) And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don’t read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!",Joey,,,,,
 Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin’ chips is like stretching.,Joey,,,,,
" Don’t worry, Tribbianis never get full.",Joey,,,,,
 (To Monica) Who the hell is this guy?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh hey!,Joey,,,,,
 That’s it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!,Joey,,,,,
 (quietly) Oh. How-how big is that?,Joey,,,,,
 (To Rachel) It’s like me when I was born.,Joey,,,,,
" (To Monica) Seriously, who is this guy?",Joey,,,,,
 I’m afraid I’m gonna need proof.,Joey,,,,,
 You are my Everest.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh yes I do. Otherwise what’s next? Today I’m just a guy who can’t finish a turkey, but tomorrow I’m the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just…I just—I gotta change my pants. (Gets up and heads for the door.) Jeans have no give. (Exits.)",Joey,,,,,
" (entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) All right where’s that turkey!",Joey,,,,,
 Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!,Joey,,,,,
 Well that’s it. I’m done. Whew! (Wipes his forehead.) There come the meat sweats. (Chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.),Joey,,,,,
" No just, nobody press on my stomach.",Joey,,,,,
 Whoa—hey—wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?,Joey,,,,,
" Ah, just cut me a little sliver. (Monica prepares to cut a little sliver.) A little bigger. (Monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.) Little bigger. (Monica moves the knife again.) What?! Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh hey Rach, listen—Hi!",Joey,,,,,
" Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin’ to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren…",Joey,,,,,
" No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she’s really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y’know, to give her some advice.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, so will you meet with her?",Joey,,,,,
" Great! Thanks! You’re gonna love her so much. And—Oh, she’s the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y’know the S.A.T’s?",Joey,,,,,
 She took ‘em!,Joey,,,,,
" (entering, with Dina) Here she is! Future fashion superstar!",Joey,,,,,
 My little sister Dina!,Joey,,,,,
" This is so exciting for her. Well, I’ll let you two fash…ists get down to business. (Exits.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! It’s my fashion girls! (They don’t react.) What’s wrong?,Joey,,,,,
" (concerned) Oh. What’s, what’s going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad’s heart? Is that a sandwich?",Joey,,,,,
 Is that a sandwich?!,Joey,,,,,
 (angrily) What?!,Joey,,,,,
 Well obviously this is a mistake! You can’t be pregnant! Because you have to have s*x to get pregnant!,Joey,,,,,
 (to Rachel) Bub!!! (Points at her and quiets Rachel.) (To Dina) I can’t believe this! You’re the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!,Joey,,,,,
" You got pregnant for funny?! Dina…if he’s funny…laugh! All right, I’ll be back in a little while! You stay here!",Joey,,,,,
 I can’t look at you right now! (Exits and slams the door behind him.),Joey,,,,,
" Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman…",Joey,,,,,
" Don’t interrupt me when I’m talkin’ to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man…",Joey,,,,,
 Oh you’ll take ‘em!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! You don’t get a say in this!,Joey,,,,,
" Ahhh! I heard ""I do"", we’re halfway there! Okay! (To Bobby) You!",Joey,,,,,
 Well what am I supposed to do?,Joey,,,,,
 No they can’t! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let’s hear their plan! Now, what’s the future look like for Dina and Bobby?",Joey,,,,,
 (to Dina) You were right. He is funny.,Joey,,,,,
" Dina, if you’re having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! (Bobby gets happy.) Dude, that’s not a compliment!",Joey,,,,,
 So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You’re gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?! You can’t be a single mother alone! You’re gonna ruin your life!,Joey,,,,,
 No! No! No! It’s different for you. You’re so strong and together. You’re not some dumb kid who doesn’t know what she’s doing.,Joey,,,,,
" One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.",Joey,,,,,
" Maybe! (To Bobby) Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!",Joey,,,,,
 Because! ‘Cause… ‘Cause you’re my baby sister!,Joey,,,,,
" Well I’d be scared of them, but all right.",Joey,,,,,
 Of course he’s gonna have his Uncle Joey!,Joey,,,,,
 That’s right! By his uncle too!,Joey,,,,,
 Come here! (Hugs Dina and Bobby looks to hug Rachel.),Joey,,,,,
" Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now. (Brushes something off of his shirt and looks around, but doesn’t move from his chair.)",Joey,,,,,
" I’m missin’ picture time?! (Jumps over to look, Ross glares at him and he retreats.)",Joey,,,,,
 (To Ross) Congratulations! You just got married!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey-hey, hey that’s your wife you’re talking about!",Joey,,,,,
 Who was that?,Joey,,,,,
 You hung up on the pizza place? I don’t hang up on your friends.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, what’s wrong?",Joey,,,,,
 Then why did I ask?,Joey,,,,,
 Is that college talk for horny?,Joey,,,,,
" Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.",Joey,,,,,
 Good night. (They both enter their rooms.),Joey,,,,,
 (entering) I can’t do it!,Joey,,,,,
 You’re Rachel!,Joey,,,,,
 You’re my friend!,Joey,,,,,
" But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.",Joey,,,,,
 I know!,Joey,,,,,
 Do you wanna do it?,Joey,,,,,
" All right, me neither! I was just testing you!",Joey,,,,,
 This conversation never happened!,Joey,,,,,
 Good night!,Joey,,,,,
 Get back in there! (Rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.),Joey,,,,,
 (To Rachel) Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm…",Joey,,,,,
" I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?",Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, great! Thanks!",Joey,,,,,
" You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone s*x, I’ll tell ya…",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, y’know what?",Joey,,,,,
 Why don’t I take you out?,Joey,,,,,
" Yes I do! And we’re gonna go out, we’re gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out…",Joey,,,,,
 I’ll be fun.,Joey,,,,,
" No, I’m picking you up for our date. These are for you. (Hands her some flowers.)",Joey,,,,,
" And, a brownie! (Hands her a bag with the brownie in it.) Well, half a brownie. Actually, it’s just bag. It’s been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin’ to feel faint so…",Joey,,,,,
" Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so…nice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.",Joey,,,,,
 I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.,Joey,,,,,
" Ah… Hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?",Joey,,,,,
" No-no-no-no, he’s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!",Joey,,,,,
" Y’know what? Bring her both, and I’ll have the same. (The waitress leaves.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We’re on a date.",Joey,,,,,
" No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don’t like me for—(Laughs.) I’m sorry I couldn’t even get through that.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.",Joey,,,,,
" Well it does when you combine it with, ""This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!""",Joey,,,,,
" Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you’re so beautiful…I don’t think I can.",Joey,,,,,
" Alright, so…so tell me one of your moves.",Joey,,,,,
" That’s your move? Boy Rach, you’re lucky you’re hot.",Joey,,,,,
 (exasperated) Queens.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.",Joey,,,,,
" I don’t know. I guess there’s just always been this distance y’know—I mean we both try to pretend it’s not there, but it is.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, it is. It’s really tough. Y’know sometimes I think—Wow!! Nice move!",Joey,,,,,
" ""Where’d you grow up,"" it’s so simple!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Yes I am! Again so simple!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?",Joey,,,,,
 Chandler?,Joey,,,,,
" Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!",Joey,,,,,
 I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?,Joey,,,,,
" I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.",Joey,,,,,
 Huh. Huh.,Joey,,,,,
" Ah! Okay, well then you don’t judge me. I’m gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before. (They both do as they planned.)",Joey,,,,,
" Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.",Joey,,,,,
" Now you can’t tell anyone, but uh…I put on shiny lip balm.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I’m telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.",Joey,,,,,
 Why not?,Joey,,,,,
" More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! (Rachel just looks at him.) I didn’t say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!",Joey,,,,,
" (stunned and turned on) Yeah. Why—Yeah, that would work for ya…",Joey,,,,,
 Oh. (She kisses him.) Yeah. (She goes into her room.) Me to. (He then starts to freak out.),Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, I still can’t believe you haven’t seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?",Joey,,,,,
 Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah? All right, let’s do it tonight.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh right!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah me too, all night.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah well that’s because uh…I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don’t want to look in my hamper.",Joey,,,,,
" No-no! I’m fine. It’s just… Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you’ve known for a while and then suddenly…suddenly see them a different way?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. Yeah, that…that’s exactly it. You’re right. Yeah.",Joey,,,,,
" (deadpan) Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I’m talking about.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, sure. (She gets up, walks towards the bathroom, and Joey watches her go.) Ehhh.",Joey,,,,,
 (incredulous) Alone?!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, did you get to the part where they’re trapped in the car and Cujo’s throwin’ himself at the windshield?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh uh, it didn’t work out.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh uh, okay. Yeah.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh sure, yeah, why not? (Sits on the arm of the chair.)",Joey,,,,,
" All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it’ll be okay.",Joey,,,,,
 Terrified. (But for a totally different reason.),Joey,,,,,
" (thinking) All right. It’s a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you don’t feel that now. It was crazy! You’re fine. You’re better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everything’s normal! She’s just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.",Joey,,,,,
" (thinking) Hey, it’s your girlfriend, Rachel!",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, neither.",Joey,,,,,
" I don’t know. It’s-it’s just…lately, I’ve been feeling… Okay, here’s what it is… (Pause) You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks! (Starts to leave)",Joey,,,,,
" All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that’s different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?",Joey,,,,,
" It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey. Well, what’s up?",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 Whaaat?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh my God. You do?,Joey,,,,,
" I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it’s Rachel for God sakes.",Joey,,,,,
 I know. I know. And she’s not only my friend; she’s my pregnant friend! She’s my pregnant friend who’s Ross’ ex!,Joey,,,,,
" What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y’know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don’t like about her. You want to hear it?",Joey,,,,,
" She made me switch to light Mayo. That’s it! That’s all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!",Joey,,,,,
 You think?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, just a crush! That’s all this is! It’s a crush! I’m Joey; I don’t get deep feelings.",Joey,,,,,
 Not really.,Joey,,,,,
 (from outside the bathroom) Hello?,Joey,,,,,
 Why?,Joey,,,,,
 (entering the bathroom) What are you guys doing in here?,Joey,,,,,
" It’s no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It’s just a crush! It’s going to go away! (Looks down) Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!",Joey,,,,,
" (thinking) All right. It’s a new day, and it’s just a crush, that’s all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, ""it was cuckoo!"" Everything’s going to be fine. It’s just a crush.",Joey,,,,,
 (thinking) I love you.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, weâ€™re almost there! Weâ€™re almost there!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I love you too.",Joey,,,,,
" Thatâ€™s always appropriate! (Back to the matter at hand) Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!",Joey,,,,,
 What? Whatâ€™s going on?,Joey,,,,,
 Aaaahâ€¦,Joey,,,,,
 Really?!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yâ€™know what? Maybe uh, youâ€¦you should come to me. Iâ€™m a not, Iâ€™m not wearing any bottoms.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh my, oh my God!",Joey,,,,,
 Mia Hamm?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh thatâ€™s amazing. (Drops the sheet.),Joey,,,,,
 Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey Ross! The babyâ€™s kicking!,Joey,,,,,
 A dreamless sleep.,Joey,,,,,
 Well I got stuff going on in here (Rubbing his belly) if you wanna feel.,Joey,,,,,
 Wow! Can I get a copy of that?,Joey,,,,,
" Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?",Joey,,,,,
 Why not?,Joey,,,,,
" I donâ€™t know. Ooh, I bet itâ€™s Richard.",Joey,,,,,
" Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe sheâ€™s having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!",Joey,,,,,
" I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Yâ€™know it wouldnâ€™t kill ya to respect your wifeâ€™s privacy! (He walks away and into his apartment and looks the door.) Stupid closet full of bugs!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh hey whoa-whoa, donâ€™t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.",Joey,,,,,
" Absolutely. But, weâ€™re gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? Iâ€™ll page Ross on the way. Come on.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everythingâ€™s gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. (Rachel grabs his hand.) Oww crushing bones!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! So?,Joey,,,,,
 So but everything is normal.,Joey,,,,,
 And-and thereâ€™s no danger to her and the baby?,Joey,,,,,
 Calm?! I wasnâ€™t calm! Iâ€™ve never been more scared in all my life!,Joey,,,,,
 Well what do I know?! Iâ€™m not a doctor!,Joey,,,,,
 You sure?!,Joey,,,,,
 (seeing Ross) Oh hey-hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey uh, whatâ€™s with the candy?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh hey, donâ€™t worry about it man. Donâ€™t worry about it, no big deal.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! (Grabs Ross around the shoulders.) He brought Twizlers!",Joey,,,,,
" Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?",Joey,,,,,
 Then why do you throw like one?,Joey,,,,,
" Sure. ""Monica.""",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. (Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure found that quick. (He tries the pin in the lock.) I justâ€”I wish I didnâ€™t feel this way about Rachel anymore, yâ€™know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I thinkâ€¦I think Ross feels left out. Yâ€™know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. Godâ€¦ You shouldâ€™ve seen the look on Rossâ€™s face. (Pause) By the way, I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing here. For all I know Iâ€™m just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I justâ€¦I feel terrible.",Joey,,,,,
 Whatâ€™s going on?,Joey,,,,,
 Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.,Joey,,,,,
 Iâ€™m on it! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich.),Joey,,,,,
 Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.",Joey,,,,,
" The thing isâ€¦â€™cause I live with Rachel Iâ€™m here for a lot of the stuff, okay? (To Rachel) And Rossâ€¦Ross is missing everything. Soâ€¦",Joey,,,,,
 Maybe you two should live together.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems thatâ€¦if youâ€™re gonna have a roommate, yâ€™know it might as well be the father.",Joey,,,,,
" All right now, so? What do you think?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I was due.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldnâ€™t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, itâ€™s a couple weeks past itâ€™s expiration date, so itâ€™s got a bit of a kick.",Joey,,,,,
" Are you kidding me? Iâ€™m great! Yeah, Iâ€™m uh; Iâ€™m better than great. I am good. And now that sheâ€™s gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldnâ€™t do before. Yâ€™know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Yâ€™know? I can uh, I can watch p0rn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Yâ€™know? I like being on my own, Iâ€™m uh, better off this way. Iâ€™m uh, a lone wolf. Yâ€™know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. Whatâ€™s a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?! (Chandler rushes over and hugs him.)",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, so, uh, how’s it going living over at Ross’?",Joey,,,,,
 Bye.,Joey,,,,,
 There’s one lucky to-go cup of coffee.,Joey,,,,,
 Thanks. But maybe later.,Joey,,,,,
 You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine’s Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that’s never going to happen!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, okay.",Joey,,,,,
" No, I’m not sleeping with your friend Jane again.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.",Joey,,,,,
" Thanks so much, Pheebs! (to the dog) We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! (the dog sticks his head between Joey’s legs) Oh! Not that kind of fun.",Joey,,,,,
" Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! (Joey pretends to throw it, but really doesn’t, and the dog goes running off.) Well, you’re cute, but you’re not too smart!",Joey,,,,,
 (looking at the ball the dog brought back) Did I just throw this?,Joey,,,,,
 Hi.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, that’s, uh, that’s Phoebe’s friend’s dog. I don’t know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.",Joey,,,,,
" (to the dog) C’mere. Hey. C’mere. That’s Rachel. She’s the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you—we love her. But we can’t have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You’re a guy. (thinks about it and picks up the dog and looks) Well, you used to be.",Joey,,,,,
" So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn’t going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, sure. Go ahead. (pause) Oh, me, right!",Joey,,,,,
 Nothing. We just talked about stuff.,Joey,,,,,
 Rachel stuff.,Joey,,,,,
 He’s breathing!,Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no, no! He’s fine! Look, look, look! (picks up the ball) Here’s your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! (he throws the ball and it bounces right next to the dog) Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, what’s up?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, man, I’m sorry. Why?",Joey,,,,,
" Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine’s Day.",Joey,,,,,
 Sort of.,Joey,,,,,
 You don’t have to seem so happy about it.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I…I d—",Joey,,,,,
 Forget about it. It’s no big deal.,Joey,,,,,
 It’s nothing.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, uh…sit down. (they do) Um… there’s this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh…it can’t happen.",Joey,,,,,
 No!,Joey,,,,,
 Yes.,Joey,,,,,
" Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn’t matter, because I can’t do anything about it.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, it’s complicated. She’s with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we’re really good friends.",Joey,,,,,
 No. I don’t think so.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, he’s the best.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I don’t know.",Joey,,,,,
" I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah.",Joey,,,,,
 It’s Rachel.,Joey,,,,,
" There’s this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, it’s complicated.  She’s with this other guy.  For a long time.  And I could never do that to the guy, y’know?  ’Ccause we’re really good friends.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, he’s the best.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I don’t know.",Joey,,,,,
" I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—",Joey,,,,,
 It’s Rachel.,Joey,,,,,
 Yes.,Joey,,,,,
 Yes. I like Rachel.,Joey,,,,,
" (startled) Yeah, okay but look, buy uh—Hey-hey, y’know, y’know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn’t get said enough. I like you Ross.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, but it’s not a big deal.",Joey,,,,,
" I’m an actor, y’know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.",Joey,,,,,
" Look no, I-I know it’s bad, and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-but it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are just feelings, they’re gonna go away.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don’t…,Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh what then? Kick me?,Joey,,,,,
 (getting worried) Bite me?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?,Joey,,,,,
" Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don’t…",Joey,,,,,
" (pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh…I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)",Joey,,,,,
" Anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over her, that’s all. I’m not even sure how to do that, I mean I’ve never been in love before so…",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I thought you knew that.",Joey,,,,,
" Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don’t want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, ""Ah, I’ll get over this."" Y’know? I just—It just keeps gettin’ harder. I don’t, I don’t know what to do. Y’know? What do I do?",Joey,,,,,
 Okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.,Joey,,,,,
 But what if uh—and I’m not saying she will be—But…,Joey,,,,,
 Are you sure?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey thanks.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven’t even thought about what I will say. What should I say?,Joey,,,,,
" I’m sorry, you’re right. What am I gonna say? (He takes another sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) Oh!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so as Rachel opens the door and startles him.)",Joey,,,,,
" I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.",Joey,,,,,
 Here? In the hall? What are we animals?,Joey,,,,,
" Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I…want to have dinner with you tonight. That’s all.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. That’s good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you’re gonna say. Good. Yeah. (Someone comes out of his apartment and it startles Joey again.) Don’t you people ever knock?!",Joey,,,,,
" What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason…(Exhales slowly)—Is it hot in here?",Joey,,,,,
" I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweater out, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)",Joey,,,,,
 Uh… How long have we known each other?,Joey,,,,,
" Uh-huh, long time.",Joey,,,,,
 But over the past few weeks…,Joey,,,,,
" Actually uh, could you give us a second?",Joey,,,,,
 I’m not quite sure.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, here we are. Uhh… I… I think I’m…falling in love with you.",Joey,,,,,
 I’m falling in love with you.,Joey,,,,,
 Does it really matter?,Joey,,,,,
" Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don’t have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. (Long pause as Rachel says nothing.) Okay, you gotta say something!",Joey,,,,,
 But. (Hangs his head down.),Joey,,,,,
" Yeah-yeah right. That’s okay. That’s fine. That’s uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it’s no big deal. All right? I think I’m gonna go. (Stands up.)",Joey,,,,,
" Don’t start doing that. You can’t do that Rach, ‘cause then you’re gonna make me do that. (Starts to cry.) Oh, here we go! (Sits down next to her.)",Joey,,,,,
 Sure!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can’t. Okay? Ever!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh no-no Rach, please, don’t be sorry. Okay? Don’t be sorry. (They hug again.) Y’know I was only kidding you.",Joey,,,,,
 (hearing Rachel and jumping up with his plate) Oh God! That’s Rachel!,Joey,,,,,
" No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here! (Turns to run to the bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.) Don’t eat that! (Runs to the bathroom as Rachel enters.)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, a naked bagel game? (Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler) Dude, I don’t know. That’s a pretty small hole.",Joey,,,,,
 I can’t! Y’know? You guys don’t know what it’s like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.,Joey,,,,,
" All right so, so what do I do?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. Okay. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.) Whoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your…,Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 Hi.,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" So you uh, have a…big work problem?",Joey,,,,,
" Huh. Okay. (Awkward silence.) So uh, I think I’m gonna take off.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
 What?! Oh my-oh my God!,Joey,,,,,
 What he wants to buy your baby?!,Joey,,,,,
 That’s crazy!,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, how did this even happen?",Joey,,,,,
 Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.,Joey,,,,,
 Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!,Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy’s not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.",Joey,,,,,
 Let’s just say I took care of it.,Joey,,,,,
" Don’t worry! Don’t worry. I just told him, very nicely, ""You don’t go buying people’s babies, so back off!!""",Joey,,,,,
 What?! Why?!,Joey,,,,,
 And you couldn’t think of anything else?!,Joey,,,,,
 You lied to me!,Joey,,,,,
 So? What-what-what happened?,Joey,,,,,
 I know. I know.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey you’re right. Yeah, it’s kinda been like us again a little bit.",Joey,,,,,
 Me too. I mean I…haven’t thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn’t feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.,Joey,,,,,
" So, who’s the guy?",Joey,,,,,
" Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. (Points to himself) I’m an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. (snaps fingers)",Joey,,,,,
 Are you kidding me? Watch! (Makes funny faces trying to cry) Well I can’t do it with you guys watching me!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them.",Joey,,,,,
 And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.,Joey,,,,,
" I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don’t want him complimenting my thing.",Joey,,,,,
 I know,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker’s a nice guy and I’d like to get to know him.",Joey,,,,,
 Why?,Joey,,,,,
 What-what?,Joey,,,,,
" I know I’m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!",Joey,,,,,
" I guess it could’ve been, I didn’t really look at it. Y’know, I just wiped it on Chandler’s coat and got the hell out of there.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There’s nothing wrong with him he’s a good guy.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.,Joey,,,,,
" Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.",Joey,,,,,
 Nothing…,Joey,,,,,
" (reading) Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That’s me!! I’m blank!!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah you are baby.,Joey,,,,,
" No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.",Joey,,,,,
" Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.",Joey,,,,,
" Fine! All right, I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y’know, start to say something stupid.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.",Joey,,,,,
" (laughs) Actually, I didn’t know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn’t have mattered, I’m doing this for the fans, not for the free food.",Joey,,,,,
 And I’ll have all the muffins.,Joey,,,,,
 (He goes into a song and dance number),Joey,,,,,
" Oh, you said it Mike. (Rips open the carton and spills milk on the counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!",Joey,,,,,
" (finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy. (Starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I guess it is. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship, (Smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I’m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you’ll be long gone. But I won’t have aged at all. (Gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne… baby…I’m gonna want to meet her.",Joey,,,,,
" Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do…so I just watch 'em have s*x. And then I say, wait, here's my line, (Joey from TV) you know that's bad for the paper tray.",Joey,,,,,
" Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am…",Joey,,,,,
" Well, there are so many things, it’s hard to pick just one.",Joey,,,,,
 (drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because he’s got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To Rachel) Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?,Joey,,,,,
 What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there. (Points to the coast.),Joey,,,,,
 (To Chandler) Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!,Joey,,,,,
" Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!",Joey,,,,,
 I think you’re right.,Joey,,,,,
 One.,Joey,,,,,
 That’s kinda nice.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!!,Joey,,,,,
" In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I’m also a mento for the kids.(The gang shake their heads.) Y’know a mento, a role model. (Chandler bites his fist to keep from talking.)",Joey,,,,,
 Right.,Joey,,,,,
" Matter of fact, I do.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.",Joey,,,,,
" Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks his pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!",Joey,,,,,
" Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.",Joey,,,,,
" No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows Chandler.) Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was using.) Damn you 15s!",Joey,,,,,
 I like it.,Joey,,,,,
 What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood.,Joey,,,,,
" The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes—Hey, what was in that brown jar?",Joey,,,,,
 Not anymore.,Joey,,,,,
" (pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin’? (Starts digging in.)",Joey,,,,,
" Uhh, I don’t believe in these crazy diets y’know, just everything in moderation.",Joey,,,,,
 I’ll take those to go. (To the interviewer) For the kids.,Joey,,,,,
" It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t have said. But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I said that I… (The gang jumps up and interrupts him.)",Joey,,,,,
" You guys, this is Shelley, she’s interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends…",Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 No thanks.,Joey,,,,,
 How come you have two?,Joey,,,,,
 Get out.,Joey,,,,,
" Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.",Joey,,,,,
 No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.,Joey,,,,,
 Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.),Joey,,,,,
 I know.,Joey,,,,,
" All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and eats it.)",Joey,,,,,
" Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.",Joey,,,,,
" All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)",Joey,,,,,
" Judge rules, no violation.",Joey,,,,,
 And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!,Joey,,,,,
" Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...,Joey,,,,,
" That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you!",Joey,,,,,
" Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.",Joey,,,,,
 Really? Me? Wow! I don’t even know any huge gay people!,Joey,,,,,
" What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!",Joey,,,,,
 I think face to face.,Joey,,,,,
" Face to face, yeah!",Joey,,,,,
 All right.,Joey,,,,,
 (grunting) Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!,Joey,,,,,
" Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.),Joey,,,,,
" Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe that he’s got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!",Joey,,,,,
 No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.,Joey,,,,,
" It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it… Oh My God, I’m a woman!!!",Joey,,,,,
 Great nap.,Joey,,,,,
" Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are. (Chandler and Ross look at each other.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, ""Hey, how you doin’?""",Joey,,,,,
" (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin’?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! How you doin’?,Joey,,,,,
" I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping. (The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin’?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?",Joey,,,,,
 What?!?! Oh dear God!,Joey,,,,,
 Not much to tell there I’m really shy.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh great! Great! Thank you. (They shake hands.),Joey,,,,,
 Bye-bye. (The interviewer leaves and he sits down with the rest of the gang.) I did it!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I don’t watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y’know?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, good to know. (The interviewer leaves.) So close!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.",Joey,,,,,
" Little bit, yeah.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, that’s just a little something for my huge gay fan base. (Winks at him.)",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, you’re the one that loves the picture.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh no, I can’t go. I’m practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I’ll (In a sexy voice) Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night I’ll be (In an announcer’s voice) Joey Trrrribbiani!",Joey,,,,,
 But the audition’s in a couple hours and I don’t even understand the game.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh really? That’d be great! You guys can be the contestants!,Joey,,,,,
 (announcer voice) All right! Let’s play Bamboozled!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, isn’t that a cool name?",Joey,,,,,
" All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don’t you tell us a little something about you Ross?",Joey,,,,,
" I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?",Joey,,,,,
" Excellent! Let’s play Bamboozled! Chandler, you’ll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?",Joey,,,,,
" It’s Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.",Joey,,,,,
" I should know that. Let’s see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.",Joey,,,,,
 This is embarrassing. (Looks it up.),Joey,,,,,
" All right Ross you’re in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.",Joey,,,,,
" No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you’re ready to answer the question.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris…Holy cow, that’s a big word. Trisc… Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?",Joey,,,,,
 This one right here. (Ross whines.),Joey,,,,,
" No! No, fear of the number 13.",Joey,,,,,
" All right Chandler, you’re up.",Joey,,,,,
" All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.",Joey,,,,,
 You-you must choose Mr. Bing.,Joey,,,,,
" Choose, you jackass!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross’s points!",Joey,,,,,
" (To Chandler) In what John Houston film would you hear this line, ""Badges? We don’t need no stinkin’ badges!""",Joey,,,,,
 Correct! There’s a possible backwards bonus!,Joey,,,,,
 Yes!,Joey,,,,,
" Wise choice, how many rungs?",Joey,,,,,
 (makes a sound like a monkey) That noise can only me one thing.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, it’s an audio question, name this television theme song. (Starts humming the theme to I Dream of Genie.)",Joey,,,,,
" Yes! Yes, you’re back in the lead!",Joey,,,,,
" All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!",Joey,,,,,
 Of course!,Joey,,,,,
 Who invented bifocals?,Joey,,,,,
 Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?,Joey,,,,,
" Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!",Joey,,,,,
" Now, over to Chandler.",Joey,,,,,
 Are you sure?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you’ve been Bamboozled!",Joey,,,,,
 (announcer voice) It’s a pleasure to meet you Ray.,Joey,,,,,
 (announcer voice) Rightie-O Ray!,Joey,,,,,
" (to the camera) Hello, I’m Joey Tribbiani! Let’s play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?",Joey,,,,,
" Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?",Joey,,,,,
 What—Why?!,Joey,,,,,
 Well what’s complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You’re in Paradise Pond!,Joey,,,,,
 Well what’s fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that’s just people standing around answering questions?,Joey,,,,,
 (announcer voice to the camera) Let’s play Bamboozled!,Joey,,,,,
" Man, this is bad! And I’ve had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though. (Quoting) ""Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal.""",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I’m not just saying this because I’m your friend, I’m sayin’ it ‘cause it’s the truth. You’re food is abysmal!",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Hey uh Monica, I can’t remember. Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movies?",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, I’ll see you there. (Starts to leave)",Joey,,,,,
" Sure, I can hang out ‘til I have to meet ya. (To Chandler) What uh—How come you’re not going?",Joey,,,,,
 I thought you already have a job.,Joey,,,,,
 Wow! How do you know how to do that?!,Joey,,,,,
 What is it?,Joey,,,,,
 You cooked him?,Joey,,,,,
" Either eat it, or be in it.",Joey,,,,,
 Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there’s a new class comin’ in.,Joey,,,,,
 Hi.,Joey,,,,,
" When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?",Joey,,,,,
 Cheese makes me thirsty.,Joey,,,,,
 All right.,Joey,,,,,
" I can an A? In-in school? (To Joey) Hey, I’m a dork.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don’t want to go. I’m having fun.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it’s time to go, it’s time to go. (Starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)",Joey,,,,,
" Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that’s the first A I’ve gotten since seventh grade, and I didn’t have to sleep with the teacher this time.",Joey,,,,,
 What the hell!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, this was a stupid idea. (Exits.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, it’s a poster for that World War I movie that I’m in, check it out.",Joey,,,,,
 Uh-huh! I know. I’m coming soon to a theater near you! I’m in THX! I’m unsuitable for children!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah, it’s already generating Oscar buzz.",Joey,,,,,
 I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and you’re all invited! (They all gasp.),Joey,,,,,
 Sure! Why not?!,Joey,,,,,
 Hello?,Joey,,,,,
 One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh my God. So that’s it?! I only get to bring one guest?,Joey,,,,,
" (to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.",Joey,,,,,
 You said you didn’t want to go.,Joey,,,,,
 Definitely not invisible.,Joey,,,,,
 Well uh…I think I want to take Chandler.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! Yeah! I mean I’m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y’know Chandler always supported my career. He’s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.",Joey,,,,,
" It’s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it’s-it’s everything. Y’know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn’t get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn’t believe in myself.",Joey,,,,,
 Thanks. That means a lot to me.,Joey,,,,,
 (in a manly voice) I’m gonna go shave. (Gets up.),Joey,,,,,
 A little tall.,Joey,,,,,
" Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler does so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)",Joey,,,,,
" (onscreen) ""I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along.""",Joey,,,,,
" (To Chandler) Okay, this is it. It’s my big fight scene coming up. (He looks over and Chandler and notices that he’s asleep.)",Joey,,,,,
 You liked it? You really liked it?,Joey,,,,,
 Which part exactly?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?",Joey,,,,,
 You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn’t take any of my suggestions! That’s for coming buddy. I’ll see you later. (Starts to walk out.),Joey,,,,,
 Hey! Sleeping beauty!,Joey,,,,,
" (in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?",Joey,,,,,
" Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You’ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?",Joey,,,,,
" Give me a number, I don’t want to owe you anything!",Joey,,,,,
" Ah-ah-ah! We’re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, so that’s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that’s… (Pauses to figure it out.)",Joey,,,,,
 Please!,Joey,,,,,
" All right, what else?",Joey,,,,,
 Which we’re still keeping under our hats!,Joey,,,,,
" What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) ""The south will rise again man.""",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. Okay, so I’m writing you a check for…So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! You made it!,Joey,,,,,
 You’re ready to have a baby? My boy’s all grown up!,Joey,,,,,
 (voice all high and weird) What?! Are you crazy?!,Joey,,,,,
 God. He’s crazy! Why doesn’t he want to be with Rachel?,Joey,,,,,
" I mean seriously, she’s like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn’t and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and… (Realizes everyone is staring.) I haven’t bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?",Joey,,,,,
 Come on you stupid machine! Come on!,Joey,,,,,
 (looking at her) No.,Joey,,,,,
 All right.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey I got one! I got one!,Joey,,,,,
" (standing behind her) Uh, you gotta press the button. (Does so.)",Joey,,,,,
" (walks up) Uh, she’s with me. (Introduces himself) Dr. Drake Remoray.",Joey,,,,,
 Remoray. It’s Portuguese. We need that information; I’m a doctor.,Joey,,,,,
 Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want this man’s blood on your head?,Joey,,,,,
" Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He’s a patient of mine, I’ve been treating him for years!",Joey,,,,,
" 816, thank you!",Joey,,,,,
 And what is his name?,Joey,,,,,
 Great! Go get him.,Joey,,,,,
 (looks in the window) He’s not really my type.,Joey,,,,,
 But you said he was this great guy!,Joey,,,,,
 You do attract some stinkers.,Joey,,,,,
 Hi! I’m Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.,Joey,,,,,
" I know, but I’m a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.",Joey,,,,,
" That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.",Joey,,,,,
 Date of birth?,Joey,,,,,
 Age?,Joey,,,,,
" I’m a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay. And uh, are you married.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?",Joey,,,,,
 (checking the list) Yes.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh that’s terrible. I’m-I’m really sorry.,Joey,,,,,
 Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?,Joey,,,,,
" Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y’know, sexually?",Joey,,,,,
" Oooh, wrong answer. (Exits.)",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, well he’s 33.",Joey,,,,,
 A widower.,Joey,,,,,
" He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he’s not into anything weird sexually.",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Rachel’s having her baby!! (Phoebe turns and looks at him.) Which is of no interest to me, I’m a neurologist.",Joey,,,,,
 Fake? Excuse me? Hello? (Taps the TV screen.),Joey,,,,,
" Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother’s triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do p0rn!",Joey,,,,,
 Right!,Joey,,,,,
 Me neither.,Joey,,,,,
 There she is!,Joey,,,,,
 (taking the baby) She looks so real! (The gang looks at him.) Y’know what I mean! She’s this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and…uh-oh.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we’re good.",Joey,,,,,
 What’s the matter now?,Joey,,,,,
 What was the other one Ross?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. (Notices she’s wiping her eyes.) What’s the matter?,Joey,,,,,
 What is it? Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Rach come on, what?",Joey,,,,,
 What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, how long was I watching that woman?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I guess so.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, listen to me, listen to me…you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that’s not gonna happen.",Joey,,,,,
 You don’t have to worry about that okay?,Joey,,,,,
 Sure.,Joey,,,,,
 My God.,Joey,,,,,
 Uh… Look Rach…(Ross enters.) Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It’s my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I’m really more of a candy guy. (Laughs.)",Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I’m sorry. I meant no.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh hey but, before you guys do that (To Rachel) I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.",Joey,,,,,
" (taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?",Joey,,,,,
 Dude I just did something terrible.,Joey,,,,,
" No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!",Joey,,,,,
 Because it kinda looked like I did.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…",Joey,,,,,
 It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!,Joey,,,,,
 I guess.,Joey,,,,,
 I know! I know it’s awful.,Joey,,,,,
 (happily) She said yes.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I like that. Yeah…",Joey,,,,,
 (laughs) Now let’s not get carried away. (He walks away as Monica comes over and hugs Chandler from behind.),Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come back later. (He goes to leave but runs into Ross who’s entering.)",Joey,,,,,
" It can’t be me, I’m standing right here.",Joey,,,,,
 (To Ross) We’re not peeking? (Follows him.),Joey,,,,,
" Hey uh, is it okay to come in?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya.",Joey,,,,,
 (watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.),Joey,,,,,
 Dear Lord.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…",Joey,,,,,
" Y’know, I don’t really know her.",Joey,,,,,
 (To God) Are you kidding me?!,Joey,,,,,
 I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy! (Storms out.),Joey,,,,,
" No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.",Joey,,,,,
 I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.,Joey,,,,,
" Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don’t want to hurt her.",Joey,,,,,
" You’re right. You’re right. I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I’ll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) if you want to check that out.",Joey,,,,,
 I can come back.,Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
" Actually, technically, I didn’t.",Joey,,,,,
" No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!",Joey,,,,,
" No, I didn’t!",Joey,,,,,
" No, I didn’t!",Joey,,,,,
 Ahhh!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn’t…I didn’t propose!",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.",Joey,,,,,
" No, I didn’t!",Joey,,,,,
" No, I didn’t!",Joey,,,,,
" Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!",Joey,,,,,
 (To Ross) I’ll tell you about it later. Be cool.,Joey,,,,,
" It wasn’t my ring! It’s Ross’s ring! That’s why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}",Joey,,,,,
" Dude, step up! I proposed.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh that’s right. There’s a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.,Joey,,,,,
 I can’t believe you’re not going to propose!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!",Joey,,,,,
" (looking at the ceiling) Ah, it’s beautiful.",Joey,,,,,
" Y’know what you guys? I’m uh, I’m gonna go too. And uh, I’m sorry about everything.",Joey,,,,,
" No, Rach, I should’ve told you sooner. It’s just that…Man! That kid is going to town! (Joey makes his awkward exit.)",Joey,,,,,
" (Enters) Hey you guys I’m gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.",Joey,,,,,
" (He looks around the room) This isn’t the right room, sorry folks. (leaves)",Joey,,,,,
 Why’re you so tired?,Joey,,,,,
" You know what you should’ve done, you should have told yourself that little story.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey so where’s Ross?,Joey,,,,,
 Is he still mad at us?,Joey,,,,,
 That’s not fair! I can’t do that.,Joey,,,,,
" See this is what I was afraid of, I didn’t think I should be here either but somebody (Looks at Chandler) said he’d be over it by now.",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) Hey. (Ross turns to see who it is, and seeing it’s Joey he just ignores him and turns back around.) Ross, I know you’re pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.",Joey,,,,,
" Fine, fine okay. But I gotta say technically, I didn’t even do anything wrong.",Joey,,,,,
 I said I didn’t technically.,Joey,,,,,
" Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this (Makes quote marks with his fingers.) I don’t really know what that means. (Ross just looks at him) You were saying?",Joey,,,,,
" I know I should’ve. (Makes quote marks again.) ""I’m sorry.""",Joey,,,,,
" No, come on Ross! (He grabs his bag so he can’t leave) Look, Ross, we have to get past this.",Joey,,,,,
" No, look, I don’t know what else to do. I said I’m sorry!",Joey,,,,,
" You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.",Joey,,,,,
" Why not? You’ll feel better! I’ll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.",Joey,,,,,
 A little bit.,Joey,,,,,
 Little bit.,Joey,,,,,
 (excited) A little bit more.,Joey,,,,,
" No, hit me",Joey,,,,,
 Hit me.,Joey,,,,,
 Hit me!,Joey,,,,,
" (interrupting) Hit me, hit me.",Joey,,,,,
 (shouts) Hit me! Hit me!,Joey,,,,,
 I’m sorry! It was a reflex!,Joey,,,,,
" I couldn’t help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look! (He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesn’t and Joey punches Ross. Gunther is amused.)",Joey,,,,,
 You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn’t you duck?,Joey,,,,,
" Good, good yeah, (Grabs the bags) maybe while we’re there, they can check your reflexes. (Joey opens the door and it hits Ross in the face with it.) (Makes quote marks.) ""Oops.""",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, so how is it?",Joey,,,,,
 Your thumb? That’s weird. (Makes a fist.) You sure you’re punching right? Make a fist. (Ross just looks at him with his thumb in a cast.) Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.,Joey,,,,,
" You, you want me to help you with that?",Joey,,,,,
" Name? (Ross looks at him.) I know Ross but what’s it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.",Joey,,,,,
" It’s pretty, Okay date of birth?",Joey,,,,,
" Sure, May...tember.",Joey,,,,,
 Occupation? Dinosaurs.,Joey,,,,,
" Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.",Joey,,,,,
" Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you’re gonna get together right?",Joey,,,,,
 But you two were supposed to be together.,Joey,,,,,
" Come on, Ross, that didn’t mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.",Joey,,,,,
 So?,Joey,,,,,
 Wow.,Joey,,,,,
 Really?,Joey,,,,,
 And you’re Okay with that?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, for what it’s worth, with Rachel I don’t think you’ll ever be just (Makes quote marks.) ""anybody.""",Joey,,,,,
" (makes quote marks) ""Thanks.""",Joey,,,,,
" You know, ah, I’ve been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, it’s not my fault. It’s a natural instinct.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this? (Swings to punch Chandler, he moves and he ends up punching Ross, knocking him off the stool. Ross then gets up and just stares at Joey.)",Joey,,,,,
 How long do you have to go for?,Joey,,,,,
 A year?!,Joey,,,,,
" Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.",Joey,,,,,
 We were gonna go see the Jets!,Joey,,,,,
 I can't believe you guys are moving.,Joey,,,,,
 Here you are (Hands Rachel a cup of coffee),Joey,,,,,
 (Laughs),Joey,,,,,
 Uhuh.,Joey,,,,,
 (Laughs),Joey,,,,,
" I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me. (Laughs)",Joey,,,,,
" Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.",Joey,,,,,
" I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 (Laughs) Poophack... (Laughs),Joey,,,,,
 (Laughs),Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 (Realizes that he has forgotten all about the double date) Oh my God!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?",Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
 Mike.,Joey,,,,,
 Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?,Joey,,,,,
 Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said... (Looks through his address book) There's no guy in there!,Joey,,,,,
 MIKE!!!,Joey,,,,,
 (Checks him out) Okay! (Walks over to his table and sits down with him),Joey,,,,,
" Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.",Joey,,,,,
 Atta boy!,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, look...",Joey,,,,,
 (Laughs) From school.,Joey,,,,,
" Mike, 'attorney at law'!",Joey,,,,,
 What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.,Joey,,,,,
 Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.,Joey,,,,,
" No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.",Joey,,,,,
" That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!",Joey,,,,,
" Please, we're trying to have a conversation. (Pushes the wine glass closer to Mary Ellen.)",Joey,,,,,
 What?!,Joey,,,,,
" (Laughs) Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. (To Mike) Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!",Joey,,,,,
 What are you doing? I said seven! (Holds up six fingers.) (Realizes his mistake) Argh!!!,Joey,,,,,
" Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.",Joey,,,,,
" Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. (Looks around) Mike!! Mike!!",Joey,,,,,
 (To Mary Ellen) You're leaving too?,Joey,,,,,
 Good night!,Joey,,,,,
 (Walks In),Joey,,,,,
 Look at this. My two best friends!,Joey,,,,,
 I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.,Joey,,,,,
" Dude, you see right thru me!! (They hug) (Joey heads for the door and pushes Chandler's suitcase on the way out.)",Joey,,,,,
 (On the phone with Chandler) Double promise? Call me when you land.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, bye. (He hangs up the phone.)",Joey,,,,,
 He had to board.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, this girl won't turn around and I can't tell whether she's hot or not, what do you think?",Joey,,,,,
" Alright thanks, Oh hey have you talked to Chandler?",Joey,,,,,
 how come?,Joey,,,,,
 oh why don't you fly out there and surprise him.,Joey,,,,,
 oh and you know what you should bring the black see-through teddy with the attached garters. (Nods),Joey,,,,,
 didn't till just now.,Joey,,,,,
 hot not hot (she turns around) Hot!,Joey,,,,,
 I said I think you're hot and now I'm embarrassed.,Joey,,,,,
" that would've been better, I'll try that Hi I'm Joey.",Joey,,,,,
 look I don't usually ask out women that I meet in coffeehouses,Joey,,,,,
 (turns round) gesundheit,Joey,,,,,
" really, great, did I actually ask you?",Joey,,,,,
" (turns round again) seriously Gunther you should see someone about that cold, if it gets much worse you could DIE! (Gunther looks scared)",Joey,,,,,
 yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that last piece of cake at the restaurant.,Joey,,,,,
 do you have any cake?,Joey,,,,,
 (bends down to see and the cactus pricks him in the ass) AWCH! That's why.,Joey,,,,,
 (enters) Hey,Joey,,,,,
 listen to this... I went out with this girl last night and half way through our date I realized I already slept with her.,Joey,,,,,
 well that's not even the weird part. I don't think she remembered sleeping with me.,Joey,,,,,
" yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am very memorable, you guys know.",Joey,,,,,
 and who's fault is that.,Joey,,,,,
 HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN MOST!,Joey,,,,,
 Interesting. all right I'll go out with her again and try to get past it (reaches for the chips) OH SALT BLOATY!,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 No. (Pause) wait a minute what was the little mermaid?,Joey,,,,,
" Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?",Joey,,,,,
 How could you not remember that we slept together?,Joey,,,,,
 I dunno!,Joey,,,,,
" come on, come on, search your brain all right. it was (thinks) a certain amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had s*x (starts pointing out the places) here, here, here NOT there. Anything?",Joey,,,,,
 my god woman! How many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this?,Joey,,,,,
" Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember me Hey! I still got it. (Turns back to Hayley) so were good. (She just glares at him) I'll let myself out.",Joey,,,,,
" (looks at a girl walk in) see ordinarily I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her?",Joey,,,,,
 your right! I love my life! (He gets up to go and speak to the girl and he turns back and sits down) I actually did sleep with her.,Joey,,,,,
 Thursday? But that's Halloween.,Joey,,,,,
" [It's just] So spooky, that's all.",Joey,,,,,
" I know, u-uch.",Joey,,,,,
" What about me, he? Only had one lunch today.",Joey,,,,,
" No, they're comin', we're waitin' right here.",Joey,,,,,
 Maybe we should just eat now.,Joey,,,,,
" Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there's still some food left on their place, okay, what's the restaurant's policy about people eatin' that?",Joey,,,,,
 But it happens? (waiter leaves) I'm gotta go to the bathroom.,Joey,,,,,
" If you ask me to stay, I'll pee. (leaves)",Joey,,,,,
" (returns to their old table where elderly people are sitting now, sits) Finally you guys made it. (looks up, turns left to Phoebe's chair) Pheebs, who the hell--uhuhh!",Joey,,,,,
" Thank you. (stands up and kisses her lips.) Waiter! 'alright, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep Phoebe: Risotto with the shaped truffles and the roasted rip steak with the golden Chanderelles and a Bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff I just said means snails. (Hope, *I* kept up.)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as it's ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don't care.",Joey,,,,,
 That's a great story--can I eat it?,Joey,,,,,
 (mumbling) Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.,Joey,,,,,
 Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.,Joey,,,,,
" And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because",Joey,,,,,
 Son of a bitch!,Joey,,,,,
" Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew! (runs after the waiter)",Joey,,,,,
" (returned) No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what they want.",Joey,,,,,
" Chandler, control your woman!",Joey,,,,,
" (to Chandler and Monica) Well, what is going on with you two?",Joey,,,,,
" So? Did have s*x, right?",Joey,,,,,
" See ya. Well, this is just us.",Joey,,,,,
" Do, do you gonna do it now?",Joey,,,,,
" No-ohoh. (the Bings leave, the waiter comes)",Joey,,,,,
" Nah, just me. All alone. (all the food is served) Dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special.",Joey,,,,,
 Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.,Joey,,,,,
 Joey! Joey.,Joey,,,,,
 That's the best birthday ever.,Joey,,,,,
" (in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)",Joey,,,,,
" (sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with his own keys, Phoebe looks at him in a ""yeah, yeah, yeah"" way.)",Joey,,,,,
 Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.,Joey,,,,,
" I know, right? (Chandler has really big eyes, and nods) Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?",Joey,,,,,
 Seriously? She actually said that?,Joey,,,,,
 Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!,Joey,,,,,
" Without that, you just got ""lame with women"".",Joey,,,,,
" (sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in size and he turns to Monica who doesn't understand what's happening. Then he turns back to Joey, who says ""you're welcome"" without a sound)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 (looks surprised) Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...,Joey,,,,,
 That's like a woman wanting to be a...,Joey,,,,,
" Uhm... A pen1s model. (Monica can't believe what's she's hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?",Joey,,,,,
 Really? Do you not know Chandler?,Joey,,,,,
" So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is... (he can't come up with anything)",Joey,,,,,
 ...No... (he just can't seem to grasp it),Joey,,,,,
" Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)",Joey,,,,,
 Heeeyy! Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah....,Joey,,,,,
 Not knowing when to shut up...,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.",Joey,,,,,
 Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... (he puts his fingers in position on the recorder),Joey,,,,,
 Me! I'm up for puppets!,Joey,,,,,
" I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. (and makes a ""there"" nod to Ross)",Joey,,,,,
 (kind of emotional) I am learning so much from you.,Joey,,,,,
 Allright. See you later!,Joey,,,,,
 (to Monica) Did that guy really make that joke?,Joey,,,,,
 Wow! You blow my mind...,Joey,,,,,
 Aaahh... How much do I owe you?,Joey,,,,,
 It's like the cheapest college ever.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking...",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. (realises that",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu",Joey,,,,,
 (laughs) Yeah! Right! (points at Monica) People eat birds... Bird,Joey,,,,,
" Real estate, huh? Hmmm...",Joey,,,,,
 Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.,Joey,,,,,
 Is there anything we should know about the apartment?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for",Joey,,,,,
 You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a s*x tape...,Joey,,,,,
" Hey dude, what's up?",Joey,,,,,
 Did you take that tape?,Joey,,,,,
 I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?,Joey,,,,,
 She hot?,Joey,,,,,
 How did she get me to settle down?,Joey,,,,,
 Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being,Joey,,,,,
 (backs off) What? Whoo... What?,Joey,,,,,
" All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to",Joey,,,,,
" Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.",Joey,,,,,
 You don't wanna see what I just saw! (at this moment Monica comes,Joey,,,,,
" (laughs) Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets",Joey,,,,,
" wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh my God!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm.,Joey,,,,,
" I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said ""Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani."" Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! <motions her to come over>,Joey,,,,,
 I.. I.. I need a good lie.,Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today.",Joey,,,,,
 I do not.,Joey,,,,,
" Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said ""Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's"" and he said.. <pause> He said.. ""Joey you stink at lying."" What am I going to do?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks>",Joey,,,,,
 Oh.. man..,Joey,,,,,
" Pheebs, I still need some help here",Joey,,,,,
 Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?,Joey,,,,,
 I can't believe I won.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah he's lying. He looked down.,Joey,,,,,
" I lie better then that, right?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.",Joey,,,,,
" Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. <throws hands out in the air>",Joey,,,,,
 Setting the table.,Joey,,,,,
 ooh oooh..,Joey,,,,,
 What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.,Joey,,,,,
" Actually its not pies, its just pie.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh? (Chandler walks back, looking angrily at Joey)",Joey,,,,,
 Uhm... (looks down) Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in...,Joey,,,,,
 [On phone] Hey. How come you’re answering your own phone? Where’s your crazy assistant?,Joey,,,,,
 Okay. What have we wanted to always do together?,Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no. When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are gonna be at the Wizards – Knicks game courtside!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, maybe Michael Jordan will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee!",Joey,,,,,
" Ooh. Hey, how come you door’s locked?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! Open the door! What’s going on?,Joey,,,,,
 Why are you dressed like that?,Joey,,,,,
 I thought I heard a man’s voice before?,Joey,,,,,
" Woah, woah, woah. Why are there two glasses of wine out?",Joey,,,,,
" Dude, come home!",Joey,,,,,
 Come home!,Joey,,,,,
" I don’t know how to tell you this, but I think that Monica’s cheating on ya! I told you that you shouldn’t have married someone much hotter than you! Chandler looks at Monica. They nod then put their ears back to the phone. Joey walks out of his apartment and up to Monica’s door] Right, look. If you can’t come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna…",Joey,,,,,
 I just heard him!,Joey,,,,,
" No. Right, I’m going in!",Joey,,,,,
 I heard him again!,Joey,,,,,
 Great. I’ll see you when you get here. I’m gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.,Joey,,,,,
" Absolutely. You’d do it for me! Not that you’d ever have to, ‘cos I know how to keep my women completely satisfied.",Joey,,,,,
" Wow, that didn’t take long. I thought you said Tulsa was a three-hour flight?",Joey,,,,,
" Alright, alright. Then maybe you won’t mind if me and my friend takes a look around then. Huh! Where you at?",Joey,,,,,
" Bedroom’s clear, although you might need some new pillows.",Joey,,,,,
 Why do I smell men’s cologne?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.",Joey,,,,,
 I guess not.,Joey,,,,,
" You’re right, Monica. I’m so sorry.",Joey,,,,,
" Wait, wait, wait a minute. If you’ve just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?",Joey,,,,,
 What’s going on?,Joey,,,,,
" What? You think I’m too dumb to know that a husband needs to be with his wife? Uh? You think I’m like, duhhh! [Taps head with baseball bat – it hurts him]",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
" You could go to the game with me, even though I know you said you couldn’t, but then you lied to me, tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.",Joey,,,,,
 [Looking sad] Alright.,Joey,,,,,
" Thanks, here’s ya ticket.",Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
" Thanks, man. [They walk down the hall. Chandler looks at his ticket. Turns around and heads back to his apartment.] Where ya going?",Joey,,,,,
" (impressed) Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?",Joey,,,,,
 I *love* my job.,Joey,,,,,
" Rach, these are for you.",Joey,,,,,
" No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.",Joey,,,,,
 Uh-huh.,Joey,,,,,
" And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.",Joey,,,,,
 They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.,Joey,,,,,
" Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?",Joey,,,,,
 Got ya. (blinks an eye),Joey,,,,,
 Mine's is to Lilian Myers.,Joey,,,,,
 (To Gunther who comes over with coffee and a muffin) Thank you!,Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
": Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?",Joey,,,,,
 If you want I could loan you some money?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.",Joey,,,,,
 No it is awesome!,Joey,,,,,
 She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?,Joey,,,,,
" Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! (Off the director's look) Alright, eight.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word ""puppy."" Okay, so he said: ""If your puppy friend doesn't get",Joey,,,,,
" That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.",Joey,,,,,
" No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she",Joey,,,,,
 (Points to man on operating table) Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.,Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.",Joey,,,,,
" Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.",Joey,,,,,
 Nice.,Joey,,,,,
" No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.",Joey,,,,,
 He slept with you and then never called you.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!",Joey,,,,,
 Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.,Joey,,,,,
" Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?",Joey,,,,,
 You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.,Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" (To the director) Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey. So where's Mon?,Joey,,,,,
 And you're not helping?,Joey,,,,,
" You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, you too.",Joey,,,,,
 How do you think she's doing?,Joey,,,,,
" Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.",Joey,,,,,
 Sure.,Joey,,,,,
 Why not?,Joey,,,,,
" So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, sounds about right.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!",Joey,,,,,
 Yes!,Joey,,,,,
" Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)",Joey,,,,,
 For a walk.,Joey,,,,,
" Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.",Joey,,,,,
" Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!",Joey,,,,,
" Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?",Joey,,,,,
 Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.,Joey,,,,,
 Fine ... mediocre p0rn,Joey,,,,,
" Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh ... (Starts to sing) Happy birth ... (sees Molly leaving) oh, see you later (runs after Molly)",Joey,,,,,
" So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I didn't go to college.",Joey,,,,,
 Molly ... people don't study acting ...,Joey,,,,,
 (upset) Will the stable boy never get the princess??,Joey,,,,,
" No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.",Joey,,,,,
 Ok (admits),Joey,,,,,
" It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! (Chandler looks at him) The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I,Joey,,,,,
 On...?,Joey,,,,,
 Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh man! I have to get those done too?!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey hey! You dye your hair!,Joey,,,,,
 Arghhh! Double standards!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.,Joey,,,,,
 Chandler Bing.,Joey,,,,,
 OK Thanks.,Joey,,,,,
 Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh good...,Joey,,,,,
 All right let's just do this.,Joey,,,,,
 Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I need your help.",Joey,,,,,
" Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped",Joey,,,,,
" You may be a sissy but I'll still (pound you out on ground). All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one",Joey,,,,,
" All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so",Joey,,,,,
 What the hell am I supposed to do!,Joey,,,,,
" What, what.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh my God!,Joey,,,,,
" Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don’t know if I can take anymore",Joey,,,,,
" Oh my God! I didn’t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!",Joey,,,,,
 Thank you so much.,Joey,,,,,
" Listen that’s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.",Joey,,,,,
 Comb my eyelashes.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Ha, oh, of course.",Joey,,,,,
 Your eyebrows look weird.,Joey,,,,,
" Morning, roomie!",Joey,,,,,
 Fifth day's a charm.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?",Joey,,,,,
 She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.,Joey,,,,,
" No, hey, it's been great.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...",Joey,,,,,
" Wow! So, how are you?",Joey,,,,,
 Really?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, actually it...",Joey,,,,,
" Wow, really?",Joey,,,,,
" Sure, I know lots of girls. ",Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, names?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?,Joey,,,,,
" I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.",Joey,,,,,
 Why are they doing this?,Joey,,,,,
" You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?",Joey,,,,,
" I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.",Joey,,,,,
" Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.",Joey,,,,,
 I know; that just pushes them further and further apart. ,Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, that's a great plan! ",Joey,,,,,
" Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 All right! Who is he?,Joey,,,,,
 She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher! ,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh my god, you're right! ",Joey,,,,,
 She even reads for pleasure!,Joey,,,,,
 What? I'm not allowed to know smart women? ,Joey,,,,,
 I met her at the library. I went in to pee.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.",Joey,,,,,
 Ooh...I hear that's bad. ,Joey,,,,,
" Ah, yes, The Plan! (Laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like Santa Claus.)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.",Joey,,,,,
 Hello?,Joey,,,,,
 Emma? Hey! Hi!,Joey,,,,,
" How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?",Joey,,,,,
" You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!",Joey,,,,,
 Because you two were having s*x!,Joey,,,,,
 Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. (To Chandler.) You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have s*x with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this. ,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I gotta! Unless...",Joey,,,,,
 Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.",Joey,,,,,
 (BEAT) (Laughs.) You almost had me.,Joey,,,,,
 Uh-huh.,Joey,,,,,
" It's easy, you just walk in on them having s*x.",Joey,,,,,
" We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.",Joey,,,,,
 Where?,Joey,,,,,
 Can you believe they're still not here?,Joey,,,,,
" I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?",Joey,,,,,
 We've been stood up. (sniffles) And we want our free crab cakes.,Joey,,,,,
" Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'. ",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day. (Monica smiles) ... and I smelled bacon. (taking some),Joey,,,,,
 (puzzled) Who did? (Monica looks bewildered),Joey,,,,,
" (standing up, surprised) She did?",Joey,,,,,
 (still surprised) I did?,Joey,,,,,
" I don't know, but it sounds great. ",Joey,,,,,
 With Lennart Haze?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway… and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word. ",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah, and directing.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, he's done some amazing works.",Joey,,,,,
 (almost laughing) I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone. (They all laugh),Joey,,,,,
 (sitting down) Don't make me more nervous than I already am!,Joey,,,,,
 It is so amazing to meet you. (They are shaking hands) I'm such a big fan of your work.,Joey,,,,,
" Tell me about it! ""Unlimited nights and weekends!"" ",Joey,,,,,
" No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials. ",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 (regaining confidence) Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon…,Joey,,,,,
 Wow!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yah, sure.",Joey,,,,,
" Err, ""I think you know"". ",Joey,,,,,
" ""I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now.""",Joey,,,,,
" ""I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't.""",Joey,,,,,
" (understandingly) Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a… (He mimes wearing a feather on his head)",Joey,,,,,
" Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern (He speaks in what he believes is a Southern accent) ""I could go right now, maaan!""",Joey,,,,,
" (interrupting their conversation) Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: (to Producer #1) 'How you doing?' (to Lennart again) You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please. ",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 I really doubt that. ,Joey,,,,,
 (suggesting) Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me. (He sits down) ",Joey,,,,,
" Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.",Joey,,,,,
 Wooooooooow (He takes the sneaker) It's like they're on fire!,Joey,,,,,
 (determined) I give you $ 500 for them!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords? ",Joey,,,,,
" (entering) I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?",Joey,,,,,
 But I'm bursting with u-hu!,Joey,,,,,
" Actually, I really need…",Joey,,,,,
 Yes… ahahaaa (He seems to be in pain),Joey,,,,,
" (walking on the spot) ""I think you know!"" ",Joey,,,,,
" ""I am what you made me! You know what?""",Joey,,,,,
" ""I could go right now."" ",Joey,,,,,
" (urgent) ""I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!""",Joey,,,,,
 (disbelieving) I did? ,Joey,,,,,
" Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go. (He grabs his jacket and limps out of the room)",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Probably wanna know what I'm doing…?,Joey,,,,,
" Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!",Joey,,,,,
 We gotta get more of that. (He leaves the apartment),Joey,,,,,
" (hoping frantically on the spot, screaming) ""I need an answer!""",Joey,,,,,
" ""You know!""",Joey,,,,,
" ""I need an answer now!"" ",Joey,,,,,
 (screaming) Oh!,Joey,,,,,
" ""You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for – Bang – End Scene!""",Joey,,,,,
" (in pain) Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get…",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good...(He winks)...But wrong.",Joey,,,,,
" Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.",Joey,,,,,
 And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.,Joey,,,,,
 Oh...how much?,Joey,,,,,
 Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?,Joey,,,,,
 That's right I am! (Opens drawer and rummages through it. Rachel enters),Joey,,,,,
 Oo...what's in the bag?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. ""Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!"" or er.. ""Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!"" Huh!",Joey,,,,,
 You're gonna do it?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, women can. You can't.",Joey,,,,,
 The hardware store is right down the street.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I know.",Joey,,,,,
" Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.",Joey,,,,,
 (to himself) That's the fastest I have ever thought!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?,Joey,,,,,
 Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is. (shrugs),Joey,,,,,
 (To himself) I am on fire!,Joey,,,,,
 Err... Kind of.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.",Joey,,,,,
 Something personal.,Joey,,,,,
 Boob job.,Joey,,,,,
" Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.",Joey,,,,,
" Rach?! (He walks over to the fridge to put it in, but it cannot be opened either) Rachel!!!!? (He walks to the bathroom and tries to lift the toilet seat cover. It won't come up.) So I can't do anything I like????",Joey,,,,,
 Because she is!,Joey,,,,,
 Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!,Joey,,,,,
 OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey uh, where do you guys want this?",Joey,,,,,
 (voice strained) Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?,Joey,,,,,
" AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright... (He takes a box out, about to close fridge, then thinks.) Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey Ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, I can't do that!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again),Joey,,,,,
" (he stops Chandler from posting the message) No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!",Joey,,,,,
 Dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from Ross' hands),Joey,,,,,
 (after Ross leaves the room) aaand SEND! (he hits the send button),Joey,,,,,
" Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!",Joey,,,,,
 Chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near Emma's cot) Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? (he looks puzzled),Joey,,,,,
" (still very puzzled) Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!",Joey,,,,,
" Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...",Joey,,,,,
 Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!,Joey,,,,,
" Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up Hugsy) It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. (Emma cries)",Joey,,,,,
" It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.",Joey,,,,,
 (placing Hugsy back in the crib) There you go sweetie... (to Emma) This isn't over.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.",Joey,,,,,
" No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!",Joey,,,,,
" No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.",Joey,,,,,
 Make the transfer! (She does so),Joey,,,,,
" Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.",Joey,,,,,
 But he's the same.,Joey,,,,,
 But he's the same.,Joey,,,,,
 He's the same!,Joey,,,,,
 (to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!,Joey,,,,,
 Original or crappy?,Joey,,,,,
" No, sorry haven't seen him.",Joey,,,,,
" It's Monica, ok?",Joey,,,,,
" Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..",Joey,,,,,
 ... she's being unreasonable!,Joey,,,,,
 It does?,Joey,,,,,
 Really? She... she loves me?,Joey,,,,,
" Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.",Joey,,,,,
 Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.,Joey,,,,,
 How do you think I got him in the first place?,Joey,,,,,
" Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?",Joey,,,,,
 Alright!,Joey,,,,,
 (abashed) A place to entertain my lady friends.,Joey,,,,,
 (even more abashed) A place to eat spaghetti.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...",Joey,,,,,
 (hesitates for a moment)Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.,Joey,,,,,
 Uh!,Joey,,,,,
" Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?",Joey,,,,,
 I like those odds!,Joey,,,,,
 (who wasn't paying attention)What's that now?,Joey,,,,,
 (sounding panicky)Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! (Starts yelling) Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?,Joey,,,,,
 (not yelling anymore)I was?,Joey,,,,,
 I did?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh yeah! The casserole lady.,Joey,,,,,
 Ooh! Tough odds!,Joey,,,,,
 (smiling)Look who's coming around!,Joey,,,,,
 (excited)Did you get it?,Joey,,,,,
 (Still excited)By you!?,Joey,,,,,
 I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.,Joey,,,,,
 I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!,Joey,,,,,
 Can't really say!,Joey,,,,,
 (slightly irritated)I'm not really comfortable with these questions!,Joey,,,,,
" I won, hey!",Joey,,,,,
" Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?",Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.",Joey,,,,,
 You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!,Joey,,,,,
" Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?",Joey,,,,,
" I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?",Joey,,,,,
 (to Ross) I'll show you how.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I want my tickets too (takes the bowl from Rachel)! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from Monica)",Joey,,,,,
 (in pain) Oh!,Joey,,,,,
" No, no! (they all go towards the balcony but they get jammed in the window)",Joey,,,,,
" (sitting on the sofa in front of the tv) Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing.",Joey,,,,,
 And what did she say?,Joey,,,,,
 (checking the last ticket) Damnit! anybody got anything?,Joey,,,,,
" (to Chandler) Hey, that is so great about the job.",Joey,,,,,
 And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.,Joey,,,,,
" Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Me too.,Joey,,,,,
" (sitting in a chair) Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.",Joey,,,,,
" (talking to a pineapple in his hand) God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do.",Joey,,,,,
 I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, that was a disappointment...(pause) Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.",Joey,,,,,
" Right!(he starts to ape her)""Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?"" (he inclines his head as if to look at a man's private parts)",Joey,,,,,
" I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! (pause) Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!",Joey,,,,,
 Also so gay!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, wish me luck!",Joey,,,,,
" Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!",Joey,,,,,
" Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.",Joey,,,,,
" Right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
" Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!",Joey,,,,,
" but, but..",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 (Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all!,Joey,,,,,
" I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?",Joey,,,,,
" And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh...I don't think it's going very well...,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...",Joey,,,,,
" A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.",Joey,,,,,
 So...I've never played that!,Joey,,,,,
 Uh...well...just once...with you...,Joey,,,,,
 (looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about??,Joey,,,,,
" (approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.",Joey,,,,,
" Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.",Joey,,,,,
 (excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room),Joey,,,,,
" (enters the room) Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?",Joey,,,,,
" Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.",Joey,,,,,
" It's a one-woman play called ""Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life"".",Joey,,,,,
" You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!",Joey,,,,,
" I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.",Joey,,,,,
" (lifts Rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) Hey, here you go.",Joey,,,,,
 (entering the room) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 What's happenin'?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first",Joey,,,,,
 (yelling) Stupid Jane Rogers!!,Joey,,,,,
 Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.,Joey,,,,,
 I do it every year.,Joey,,,,,
 I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah...,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah...,Joey,,,,,
 (Smiling) I can't believe you guys went for that one!,Joey,,,,,
" You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!",Joey,,,,,
" (speaking aloud) Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!",Joey,,,,,
" Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.",Joey,,,,,
" (sounds tired) Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.",Joey,,,,,
 What party?,Joey,,,,,
 (looks perplexed and opens up his robe) Ok... I mean...,Joey,,,,,
 (to Charlie after covering himself up again) Nice to meet ya! (Charlie waves hesitantly and Joey leaves),Joey,,,,,
" (To some people) Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it (Shakes a man's hand) Thanks for coming.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...",Joey,,,,,
" Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands)",Joey,,,,,
 It's a science.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...",Joey,,,,,
 Monica!,Joey,,,,,
 (To Rachel) What have you got there?,Joey,,,,,
" Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?",Joey,,,,,
" (browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.",Joey,,,,,
" (discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...",Joey,,,,,
" Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.",Joey,,,,,
" That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.",Joey,,,,,
 Me.,Joey,,,,,
" Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!",Joey,,,,,
 Gotcha.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious (which, being Joey, he mispronounces ""amonious""). (pause) That's not how she used it...?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?",Joey,,,,,
 (sipping red wine from a glass) Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!,Joey,,,,,
 Heeey!,Joey,,,,,
" Come on in, how are ya?",Joey,,,,,
 Can I offer you a drink?,Joey,,,,,
" Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?",Joey,,,,,
 (looking puzzled and nodding) Ok!,Joey,,,,,
" I know, yeah!",Joey,,,,,
" Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.",Joey,,,,,
" Which one, they all suck!",Joey,,,,,
 (looking puzzled) I don't think so.,Joey,,,,,
 Ross!,Joey,,,,,
 I need to talk to you about Charlie.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.",Joey,,,,,
" No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...",Joey,,,,,
 Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!,Joey,,,,,
" (checking) EH, what do you know!",Joey,,,,,
" Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!",Joey,,,,,
" Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.",Joey,,,,,
 Thanks.,Joey,,,,,
 The Metsss!,Joey,,,,,
" (realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!",Joey,,,,,
" Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.",Joey,,,,,
" Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!",Joey,,,,,
" Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?",Joey,,,,,
 You got to tell me exactly what to do there.,Joey,,,,,
" Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the right and Joey nods)",Joey,,,,,
 (gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.,Joey,,,,,
" (shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!",Joey,,,,,
 Phonetically? (Looks confused),Joey,,,,,
 Ok.,Joey,,,,,
" Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on ""Days"" I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy"".",Joey,,,,,
" No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear"".",Joey,,,,,
" Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the imaginary painting).",Joey,,,,,
 Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again),Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 (to Charlie) You're ready?,Joey,,,,,
" (aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.",Joey,,,,,
" Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... (confidently) I made it work.",Joey,,,,,
" So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh hey Rach!,Joey,,,,,
 Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.,Joey,,,,,
" Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.",Joey,,,,,
" (to Charlie) Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to Rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!",Joey,,,,,
" What's the matter, Pheebs?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.",Joey,,,,,
" Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?",Joey,,,,,
" (to Charlie) Alright, have a good time. (they kiss)",Joey,,,,,
" Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!",Joey,,,,,
 Bye.,Joey,,,,,
" All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?",Joey,,,,,
 So you're ruling out surrogacy?,Joey,,,,,
" So, I don't have to learn what that means?",Joey,,,,,
" Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?",Joey,,,,,
" Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!",Joey,,,,,
 Hello?,Joey,,,,,
 No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh! How's it going?,Joey,,,,,
 What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!,Joey,,,,,
" Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!",Joey,,,,,
" Well, just wake him up!",Joey,,,,,
" Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?",Joey,,,,,
 (impressed) Wow! You look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!,Joey,,,,,
 Then don't go!,Joey,,,,,
" Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!",Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!,Joey,,,,,
 Mmh-mmh.,Joey,,,,,
 Barbados!,Joey,,,,,
" All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.",Joey,,,,,
" I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! (A woman goes towards them)",Joey,,,,,
" (to Charlie) I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!",Joey,,,,,
 That... never happens...,Joey,,,,,
" No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called ""The Days of Our Lives"".",Joey,,,,,
" (thinking he's kidding) Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.",Joey,,,,,
 You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?",Joey,,,,,
 You really should have been more clear about that!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?,Joey,,,,,
" You could say: ""Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?"" (looks at Ross matter-of-factly)",Joey,,,,,
 Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?,Joey,,,,,
 (smiling) Will you wear a thong?,Joey,,,,,
 Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...",Joey,,,,,
" No, why?",Joey,,,,,
 Oh man!,Joey,,,,,
" I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! (removes a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his backpack)",Joey,,,,,
 Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!,Joey,,,,,
" Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!",Joey,,,,,
" Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in (Joey, Chandler and David leave)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey guys!,Joey,,,,,
 Damnit!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? (Chandler looks annoyed at him and Joey leans in to him) Oh! Secret teapot?",Joey,,,,,
 It's really gone?,Joey,,,,,
 I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a ""Galaxy far, far away""? (Ross turns aroud and glares at him. Joey and Rachel decide to leave).",Joey,,,,,
" I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.",Joey,,,,,
 (stopping the waiter) Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?",Joey,,,,,
" (walking to a table with many badges on it) I know we're not, but (he picks up a badge) Frank Medeio and... (picks up another badge) Eva Trorro... womba...",Joey,,,,,
 Kate Miller it is. (he picks up the Kate Miller badge and sticks it on Rachel's breast),Joey,,,,,
" In that case should I make sure it's on real good? (he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it)",Joey,,,,,
" Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.",Joey,,,,,
" Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?",Joey,,,,,
" But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?",Joey,,,,,
" There it is, you're blushing!",Joey,,,,,
 You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? (tickles her a little),Joey,,,,,
 Tell me who it is.,Joey,,,,,
" Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?",Joey,,,,,
" What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?",Joey,,,,,
" (eagerly) Yeah, who is that?",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?",Joey,,,,,
" Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. (they leave),Joey,,,,,
 Night.,Joey,,,,,
" He said ""erectus""!",Joey,,,,,
" No, he really said it.",Joey,,,,,
 Erectus?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, and so funny!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey! (stands up) As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! (smiles ecstatic)",Joey,,,,,
" (disappointed) Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...",Joey,,,,,
" (interrupting her) Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech... (pulls a face)",Joey,,,,,
" (bewildered) Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! A little bit, yeah...",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah... I think we do... (sighs, with folded arms)... about what?",Joey,,,,,
 (downhearted) Hey...,Joey,,,,,
 Uh... Charlie and I broke up.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.",Joey,,,,,
" No, it's not, we have nothing in common!",Joey,,,,,
" I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!",Joey,,,,,
" (laughing sarcastically) Ok, Rach!",Joey,,,,,
" I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... (sighs) What the hell is my problem? OH! (He falls back on the bed)",Joey,,,,,
" (sitting up again) I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!",Joey,,,,,
 But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? (gives her a meaningful look),Joey,,,,,
" (stands up) No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?",Joey,,,,,
" Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!",Joey,,,,,
 You like me? (shuts the door),Joey,,,,,
 (shocked) That's a huge thing!,Joey,,,,,
 What... for how long?,Joey,,,,,
 (outraged) A MONTH??,Joey,,,,,
 (stands up) I just have one question!,Joey,,,,,
 (desperate) What the hell are you doin'???,Joey,,,,,
" Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!",Joey,,,,,
" CURIOUS GEORGE! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, he had a paper route.",Joey,,,,,
" No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!",Joey,,,,,
" (charmed, but then recoiling) NO, NO! It can't happen at all!",Joey,,,,,
" Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? (in a trembling voice) I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! (sighs) I couldn't do it to Ross!",Joey,,,,,
" I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... (painfully) I'm sorry...!",Joey,,,,,
" NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!",Joey,,,,,
 NO BIG DEAL!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...",Joey,,,,,
" Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?",Joey,,,,,
 No idea what it means.,Joey,,,,,
 I don't believe this... Have you guys been...,Joey,,,,,
 Is he gone?,Joey,,,,,
 Pssst...,Joey,,,,,
" Well, he's with Charlie now.",Joey,,,,,
" (long pause and he twitches a bit) You're a pain in my ass, Geller!",Joey,,,,,
" Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...",Joey,,,,,
 (turns around very fast) I like although!,Joey,,,,,
 Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...,Joey,,,,,
 Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.,Joey,,,,,
 I'm thinking about you...,Joey,,,,,
 Let's forget about Ross...,Joey,,,,,
 What's wrong?,Joey,,,,,
" Well, maybe I can help. (he grabs her head passionately, closes his eyes and kisses... Ross in Rachel's dress! He realises it too late, and when he does, pushes Ross's/Rachel's head away)",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...,Joey,,,,,
" Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.",Joey,,,,,
" Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?",Joey,,,,,
 I understand...,Joey,,,,,
 I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.,Joey,,,,,
 Ooh...,Joey,,,,,
 I'm gonna get the lasagna.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
 You kissed.,Joey,,,,,
 I saw you.,Joey,,,,,
" Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.",Joey,,,,,
" It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah... Now I have something...,Joey,,,,,
 Oh... uh... look... before you...,Joey,,,,,
" I am those things, yeah.",Joey,,,,,
 Dude!,Joey,,,,,
 I can't think of anything.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.,Joey,,,,,
" Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" So, did you err... did you tell Ross?",Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. (he pushes his breasts together from the side)",Joey,,,,,
" Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.",Joey,,,,,
" I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! Good night! (they give each other a small kiss on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while)",Joey,,,,,
" Good night! (they give each other a kiss again, but this time it lasts longer)",Joey,,,,,
 Stop saying good night.,Joey,,,,,
" Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?",Joey,,,,,
" Rach, he just saw us.",Joey,,,,,
" But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.",Joey,,,,,
" Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, but it did happen, so...",Joey,,,,,
 Ross?,Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no!",Joey,,,,,
 Probably.,Joey,,,,,
" No, no!",Joey,,,,,
 Really?,Joey,,,,,
 Ross..,Joey,,,,,
" Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?",Joey,,,,,
 I do like fajitas.,Joey,,,,,
" Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.",Joey,,,,,
" I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...",Joey,,,,,
 In a carriage!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, Charlie!",Joey,,,,,
" So, did you bring a little something for Ross?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh. Oh, thanks.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, actually, that's..",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.",Joey,,,,,
" Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?",Joey,,,,,
" Dude, are you okay?",Joey,,,,,
 You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.,Joey,,,,,
" It doesn't look good, does it?",Joey,,,,,
 Morning. Here you go.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..",Joey,,,,,
" It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.",Joey,,,,,
" That's what I hear, yeah.",Joey,,,,,
" Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...",Joey,,,,,
 I'm crazy about her.,Joey,,,,,
 I think so.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.",Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?",Joey,,,,,
 And we're okay?,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah. It's actually our first official date,Joey,,,,,
" Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.",Joey,,,,,
 (pause) It's OK!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!",Joey,,,,,
" No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.",Joey,,,,,
" No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.",Joey,,,,,
" NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. (He starts lightly grazing Chandler's thigh)",Joey,,,,,
 More foosball?,Joey,,,,,
" I thought you paid. (Rachel does not answer and seems puzzled) Ha, guess we won’t be going back there!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?",Joey,,,,,
 What’s the matter?,Joey,,,,,
" I don’t get it, Chandler loved it!",Joey,,,,,
 Ok.,Joey,,,,,
" (a little giddy) Uh, was that good for you?",Joey,,,,,
" Rach, you sure you wanna do this?",Joey,,,,,
" Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?",Joey,,,,,
" Ok, yeah, got it.",Joey,,,,,
 This thing welded shut?!,Joey,,,,,
" All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.",Joey,,,,,
 Sorry!,Joey,,,,,
" I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!",Joey,,,,,
 Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!,Joey,,,,,
 (contemplates for a few moments what Rachel just said) NAH! I don't have another level!!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points to the hall).,Joey,,,,,
 (To Rachel) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!",Joey,,,,,
 Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him),Joey,,,,,
" Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh! yeah!,Joey,,,,,
 uh uh!,Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!",Joey,,,,,
" (He just sits there, legs very close together with a painful look on his face) Soldier down!",Joey,,,,,
" Well, I know what's the matter with me.",Joey,,,,,
 I don't know.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.",Joey,,,,,
 That's a... pla-an.,Joey,,,,,
 (sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming.,Joey,,,,,
" I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.",Joey,,,,,
 I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.,Joey,,,,,
 So...,Joey,,,,,
 I love ya.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, me too.",Joey,,,,,
" Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" 18, uh? (starts to prepare himself to say his ""How You Doin'"" line)",Joey,,,,,
" What, what!? it's for her hot friends!",Joey,,,,,
 And starting to think about settling down!,Joey,,,,,
 I'd love to! Yeah! ,Joey,,,,,
 (To Phoebe) We were supposed to bring presents?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says ""El-moo""! (Joey starts laughing) Yeah... that's a funny cup!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!",Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no! My talents as an actor!",Joey,,,,,
" You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I think Emma might like it!",Joey,,,,,
" Um, my present!",Joey,,,,,
 Actually we prepared performances.,Joey,,,,,
 But equally real!,Joey,,,,,
 (unconfidently) O K.,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!",Joey,,,,,
 I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma’s books.,Joey,,,,,
" Uh, why, it’s a... (he picks a book up) one of her favorites, uh, (he reads the title of the book) “Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression” eesh! (he puts the book back and picks up another) “Love you forever”. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”. (the picture fades and Joey is now finishing the book). And while he rocked her, he sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”.",Joey,,,,,
 I'm so confused!,Joey,,,,,
 Got it! (Goes towards the front door and stands with his back to it) Hey hey hey! (to Chandler) Where do you think you're going?,Joey,,,,,
" Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li...(stops and thinks) Wait a minute, there is a window in there!",Joey,,,,,
" Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.",Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
 Ok! (Opens the door for them),Joey,,,,,
 Nighty-night!,Joey,,,,,
" Bye, bye.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.",Joey,,,,,
" (Shocked) Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in. (turns the bolts of the door, thereby locking it)",Joey,,,,,
 Oh! I forgot you used to live here!,Joey,,,,,
 Hello?,Joey,,,,,
 Hey! (smiles),Joey,,,,,
 (smile fades) What audition?,Joey,,,,,
 What? You never said anything about an audition!,Joey,,,,,
" A monologue? I don't have.. (sees the book he was reading before for his ""dramatic reading"") I got it. (hangs up) (announces to the room) Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?",Joey,,,,,
" Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..",Joey,,,,,
 Right.,Joey,,,,,
" Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! (they do so)",Joey,,,,,
 Come on robot!,Joey,,,,,
 Way to go robot!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, good race you guys.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!",Joey,,,,,
 (to Ross and Rachel) I've been here the whole time!,Joey,,,,,
 What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a pen1s.,Joey,,,,,
 Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!,Joey,,,,,
" No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!",Joey,,,,,
" U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.",Joey,,,,,
 Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!,Joey,,,,,
" I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.",Joey,,,,,
" Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... ""Dear baby adoption decider people...""",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?,Joey,,,,,
" That's right, yeah.",Joey,,,,,
 Always nice to meet a fan!,Joey,,,,,
" I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.",Joey,,,,,
" (using a laptop) Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...",Joey,,,,,
 What did I just say?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... (he uses the Thesaurus) ""brainy, bright, clever"", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to Chandler) Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at p0rn.",Joey,,,,,
 (sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?,Joey,,,,,
 Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!,Joey,,,,,
 Yep!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.",Joey,,,,,
 Why not?,Joey,,,,,
" Ah, look who’s back! (he sees the bags) Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?",Joey,,,,,
 What?,Joey,,,,,
 You slept out here?,Joey,,,,,
" But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re getting rid of her.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping Amy badly) ""Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!"" I don’t need that kind of talk in my house!",Joey,,,,,
 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, Monica made us!",Joey,,,,,
 Yeaah.,Joey,,,,,
" (yelling at her) I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!",Joey,,,,,
" Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked)",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later! (Leaves)",Joey,,,,,
" (picks up the phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... (looks puzzled) Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) She was nice!",Joey,,,,,
 Whoo-hoo! (and leaves for Rachel's room),Joey,,,,,
 (Yelling from Rachel's room) She has a lot of crap!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, hey! Well... (he takes his mug to toast Phoebe) Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... (a bit uncertain) I wanna say Mike? (pause) To Phoebe and Mike!",Joey,,,,,
" (Looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back. Then he closes the door, and we see it's Joey.) Hi sweetie!",Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
 Cool!,Joey,,,,,
" That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?",Joey,,,,,
" What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? (he mimes an old man with a beard) I'm old! (then he yawns) I'm tired! (then he mimes someone who's hot...) Hey, I'm hot (...and cold) I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?",Joey,,,,,
" I can do that! (in a deeper voice) ""Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..."" Oh, what's the product?",Joey,,,,,
 (after a long pause he starts miming again) I'm cold!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh! Any word on casting yet?,Joey,,,,,
" What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?",Joey,,,,,
" Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!",Joey,,,,,
 Thank you. (he sits down),Joey,,,,,
 Damn it! (he leaves),Joey,,,,,
 Just pass it to your boss!,Joey,,,,,
 What's up?,Joey,,,,,
 (sounds disappointed) Oh.,Joey,,,,,
" (looks at him suspiciously) But, ehm... you watched the tape?",Joey,,,,,
 (sounds confident) You didn't watch the tape.,Joey,,,,,
" Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?",Joey,,,,,
" Well, you lied again! (Rachel comes out of her room and is observing the conversation)",Joey,,,,,
 Keep going Pinocchio!,Joey,,,,,
 (yelling back) No you didn't! (turns and goes towards his room),Joey,,,,,
 You still here?,Joey,,,,,
" Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in the air but gives up.) (yelling) Stop lying!",Joey,,,,,
 (very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why? (goes back into his room),Joey,,,,,
" (comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. (presses play and he appears on the TV screen and a TV commercial begins)",Joey,,,,,
 (Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door).,Joey,,,,,
 (enters from his bedroom) What?,Joey,,,,,
 I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.,Joey,,,,,
 But it's an original Buffay...,Joey,,,,,
 Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?,Joey,,,,,
 GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!,Joey,,,,,
 That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.,Joey,,,,,
" Now, what do you say?",Joey,,,,,
 And?... AND?,Joey,,,,,
 Gladys?,Joey,,,,,
 You're mean!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 What's going on?,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.",Joey,,,,,
 (pointing at himself) Celebrity.,Joey,,,,,
" (going out with the VCR in his hand) Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!",Joey,,,,,
 (form the other side of the door) Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity?,Joey,,,,,
" Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...",Joey,,,,,
 Guys!?,Joey,,,,,
 What's going on?,Joey,,,,,
 Everything doesn't sound fine!,Joey,,,,,
" Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.",Joey,,,,,
 But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!,Joey,,,,,
" We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word for danger.",Joey,,,,,
 (quivering with anger) I did not care for that!,Joey,,,,,
" Ok, ok! (He leaves)",Joey,,,,,
 I forgot my bat.,Joey,,,,,
 (to Chandler) Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!,Joey,,,,,
" Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never called me.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.",Joey,,,,,
" No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.",Joey,,,,,
" Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?",Joey,,,,,
" No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? (and he leaves the apartment, leaving her shocked)",Joey,,,,,
" (acting sad) NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... (and closes the door behind him)",Joey,,,,,
" LAURA! (and points to her, very confident)",Joey,,,,,
" Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!",Joey,,,,,
 Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, they're great seats too!",Joey,,,,,
 Center ice.,Joey,,,,,
" So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.",Joey,,,,,
" Dude, two times that happened!",Joey,,,,,
" Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.",Joey,,,,,
" That's some gentle comedy, dude. (he and Ross leave)",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, Bob, get off the guy!",Joey,,,,,
" I know, yeah.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, (takes some nachos from a plate on the seat where Chandler should have been) I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.",Joey,,,,,
 Ohhhh! These seats are great!,Joey,,,,,
" (looks at the time) Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.",Joey,,,,,
 I don't know...,Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 How late are we?,Joey,,,,,
 Wow (He opens his apartment door and throws their stuff in.),Joey,,,,,
" Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were! (he raises his hands and on his right one there's a Rangers foam finger)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!",Joey,,,,,
 You are not at Thanksgiving?,Joey,,,,,
 We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time (he points the foam finger at the girls),Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, where were you!",Joey,,,,,
" Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...",Joey,,,,,
 (realizing) Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!,Joey,,,,,
" All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.",Joey,,,,,
" No. Here (he tears off the pocket from Ross' shirt, and tears off everything below that as well.)",Joey,,,,,
 (whispering) Who do you think its from?,Joey,,,,,
" I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.",Joey,,,,,
 (smiling from ear to ear) Ah-haah! I win!!,Joey,,,,,
 That's fire. Beats everything.,Joey,,,,,
" Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.",Joey,,,,,
 I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. (Ross picks it up),Joey,,,,,
 (holds his fist up) WATER BALLOON! (he stuffs the slice in is mouth and gives the foil back to Ross),Joey,,,,,
" (to Ross) Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.",Joey,,,,,
 I'm telling ya... (his eyes open wide and he looks like his eyes are about to pop out. He stares at Ross like this without blinking) I can do it.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...",Joey,,,,,
" (still with his door wedged in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at Monica and Chandler as he did with Ross earlier in the hall) Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.",Joey,,,,,
" Come on you guys, we want you to know we're (His eye widen even more) very very sorry. (Monica and Chandler are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then to the others in the hall) Right guys?",Joey,,,,,
" (smiling) Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!,Joey,,,,,
" (to Ross, mouthing) Don't make me come up there!",Joey,,,,,
 Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.,Joey,,,,,
 Sorry!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!",Joey,,,,,
 Ha!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh-oh! I'm stuck!,Joey,,,,,
 No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.,Joey,,,,,
 (in agony) aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.,Joey,,,,,
" Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.",Joey,,,,,
 I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, that smells good!",Joey,,,,,
 Okay.,Joey,,,,,
 It isn't working.,Joey,,,,,
" Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!",Joey,,,,,
 Interesting...,Joey,,,,,
 I left them at the park.,Joey,,,,,
 It's really starting to hurt.,Joey,,,,,
 Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! Come on!,Joey,,,,,
" (looking at himself) Man, I've got food all over me.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, I know how you feel...",Joey,,,,,
" Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys ""R"" Us... She was in stock!",Joey,,,,,
" I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!",Joey,,,,,
" But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?",Joey,,,,,
 I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have s*x with. (the girl leaves and Phoebe goes toward the couch) (to Phoebe) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
 So... who's your friend?,Joey,,,,,
" OW, why, why, why?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.",Joey,,,,,
" Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?",Joey,,,,,
" I know why I don't remember her, huh? (he winks at Rachel)",Joey,,,,,
" Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?",Joey,,,,,
 (pointing at himself) Growth!,Joey,,,,,
" Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. (he starts writing on his hand) Mandy.",Joey,,,,,
 Saraaah.,Joey,,,,,
" I can see why, nice shirt!",Joey,,,,,
 Stupid Gap on every corner!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 Well...,Joey,,,,,
 Nope.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? (he starts talking about the date and we can see what happened through a flashback video) We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.",Joey,,,,,
 ALL FOOD!,Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!",Joey,,,,,
 (mad and pointing a finger to himself) JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!,Joey,,,,,
" (he thinks a little, considering the option and seems to be quite satisfied) I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. (he looks absorbed in his food thoughts) What were we talking about?",Joey,,,,,
 I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!,Joey,,,,,
" (now laughing a little) Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.",Joey,,,,,
 (looking a little agitated now) Looks like someone IS the ladies!!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!",Joey,,,,,
" oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours. (Sarah reaches over and takes a few fries)",Joey,,,,,
" Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.",Joey,,,,,
" How about those fries though, huh? (Holds the plate between Sarah’s fingers and his plate, thus blocking her from reaching his)",Joey,,,,,
" (Spotting her movements takes her hand into his own) You are beautiful, you know that?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh (grinning, trying to hold in his impatience with her) okay.. (she takes her hand back)",Joey,,,,,
 (Visibly annoyed) NOW look what you did!!,Joey,,,,,
" I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?",Joey,,,,,
" WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!",Joey,,,,,
" I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean (bends down and with his plate and his hands, scrapes the dropped dinner back onto the plate and puts it back on the table) There are things you do..and you now, things.. (takes something from the plate and blows it a little) that you don't do (He takes a bite from it).",Joey,,,,,
" I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.",Joey,,,,,
" (Jokingly) Well, stuffed clams.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.",Joey,,,,,
" (More to himself than anyone else) So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh yeah, sure. No problem.",Joey,,,,,
 Sure I do. (holding up his own dessert) Coule?,Joey,,,,,
 (laughing) Really?,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, of course. I can control myself. (laughs uneasily and Sarah leaves the room)",Joey,,,,,
 (to the torte) Stop staring at me!,Joey,,,,,
" Why, just a tiny little...",Joey,,,,,
 Oh-oh!,Joey,,,,,
 I'm not even sorry.,Joey,,,,,
" (nods) So, why are you still wearing it?",Joey,,,,,
 Ooh... Not so good.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.",Joey,,,,,
 (shouting to Ross) JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!,Joey,,,,,
" Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh... food. No, s*x. Food! s*x! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!",Joey,,,,,
" Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?",Joey,,,,,
" (walking towards her to hold her and support her) Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?",Joey,,,,,
 (to Chandler) You son of a bitch!,Joey,,,,,
 I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!,Joey,,,,,
 (clearly shocked) What?,Joey,,,,,
 Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!,Joey,,,,,
" No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! (to Ross) I'm gonna thump you! (points his fist at him)",Joey,,,,,
" Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? (Walks towards the fridge) Because I can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) I really, really think I can!",Joey,,,,,
 What the hell are you doin'?,Joey,,,,,
 (he has a turkey on his head) It's stuck!!!,Joey,,,,,
 I put it on to scare Chandler!,Joey,,,,,
 It smells really bad in here.,Joey,,,,,
 It's Joey.,Joey,,,,,
 (shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.),Joey,,,,,
 Oooooh!,Joey,,,,,
 Big fat goalie.,Joey,,,,,

 Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.,Joey,,,,,
 I'm really sorry you guys.,Joey,,,,,
" You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.",Joey,,,,,
" And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?",Joey,,,,,
 A meatball Sub? Thanks! (he got a meatball sandwich),Joey,,,,,
" (speaking with his mouth full, enjoying his sandwich) What did they say?",Joey,,,,,
 Hey guys!,Joey,,,,,
 Sure.,Joey,,,,,
 Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?,Joey,,,,,
 Seriously?,Joey,,,,,
" (to Gene) I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I'm just like you! (pause) Only better looking and richer.",Joey,,,,,
" (on the screen there's the word ""Supermarket"") Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket. (there is a sound indicating he made a mistake as he shouldn't have said 'supermarket'. The next word appears, ""notebook"") Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my...",Joey,,,,,
" Noo, (whispering) more like a notebook... Damn it! (next word appears: ""blueprint"") Oh, if I'm building an house, the plan isn't called the 'shmoo-print'... Can't say that either? Woha... hey... (the last word is ""Football field"" and there are 5 seconds left) In high school, I once had s*x with a girl right in the middle of the...",Joey,,,,,
 Yeah! But that is not what they're looking for. (time's finished) OOOH!,Joey,,,,,

 Oh!,Joey,,,,,
 Ketchup!,Joey,,,,,
 Relish!,Joey,,,,,
 Oh.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah...,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? (pause). Yeah!",Joey,,,,,
 (To Henrietta) My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes! (makes a thumbs up sign),Joey,,,,,
" Oh, .. uh... uh... pass. (Next word: ""Rotunda"") Pass. (Next word: ""Filibuster"" stares at it a moment) Pass. (Henrietta is looking very confused) (Next word: ""Addendum"" 4 seconds remaining) Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, then pass. (Next word: ""Joint session"", but time's up, Joey acts very disappointed)",Joey,,,,,
 (nervously) Yeah...,Joey,,,,,
 I-I-I don't know. Types of trees?,Joey,,,,,
" (sympathetic) Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know any Spanish words.",Joey,,,,,
" Things that go ""tssst"" when you put them out.",Joey,,,,,
 Things that burn.,Joey,,,,,
" Dude, dude! I think you're losing it.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, oh, oh... What a dog says.",Joey,,,,,
" (instantly) Pizza toppings, next!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, oh, oh... (5 seconds left)",Joey,,,,,
 Girls Chandler could never get?,Joey,,,,,
 Where? (looking around),Joey,,,,,
" Uh, hey.",Joey,,,,,
 (afraid) Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 So he can't come?,Joey,,,,,
 Seriously?,Joey,,,,,
 I am pretty wisdomous.,Joey,,,,,
" Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored. (they hug)",Joey,,,,,
" (takes her hand) Listen, I hope... that you know... (has difficulty saying it) I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?",Joey,,,,,
" Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?",Joey,,,,,
" You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!",Joey,,,,,
" So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, hey, my pleasure. (he suddenly becomes very serious) So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, a wiseacre. (Mike looks bewildered). No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?",Joey,,,,,
 Strike two!,Joey,,,,,
" Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!",Joey,,,,,
 (to Mike) Hello Michael.,Joey,,,,,
" May I have a word with you, please?",Joey,,,,,
" Have a seat. (Mike sits on his bed, and Joey towers over him. He starts talking in an Italian godfather-type voice) Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... (shakes his head) I cannot allow this.",Joey,,,,,
" More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for ""Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal.""",Joey,,,,,
" I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.",Joey,,,,,
" (very satisfied and smiling) That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.",Joey,,,,,
 (almost crying) That was ME!,Joey,,,,,
 I'm glad we had this little talk.,Joey,,,,,
 (staring at the ice sculpture) How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? (They all glare at him),Joey,,,,,
" Hey, what are you guys gonna do?",Joey,,,,,
" The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels. (Opens the curtains to reveal a snow storm outside)",Joey,,,,,
 I don't think they are.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.",Joey,,,,,
" Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...",Joey,,,,,
" I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.",Joey,,,,,
" Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?",Joey,,,,,
 (whispering to Phoebe) Okay...,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?",Joey,,,,,
" Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?",Joey,,,,,
 I now pronounce you... husband and wife.,Joey,,,,,
" It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?",Joey,,,,,
" Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?",Joey,,,,,
" Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.",Joey,,,,,
" I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my résumé, I'm fluent in.",Joey,,,,,
" Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.",Joey,,,,,
 Je de coup Clow.,Joey,,,,,
 Ok.,Joey,,,,,
 Je depli mblue.,Joey,,,,,
 Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Got it.,Joey,,,,,
 Je te flouppe Fli.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, de fuff!",Joey,,,,,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,,
 Hi.,Joey,,,,,
" Welcome to New York City! Or should I say ""ghe deu flooff New York City""?",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.",Joey,,,,,
 Je do call blue!,Joey,,,,,

" Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!",Joey,,,,,
 Thank you.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!",Joey,,,,,
" Sure, sure. Ok, (clears his throat and starts to read from his script. He starts talking in a fake French accent, making gestures with his hands) ""Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu"" (Phoebe looks astonished, annoyed and disgusted, Joey seems very proud though) See?",Joey,,,,,
" (offended) Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.",Joey,,,,,
" For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!",Joey,,,,,
" Right. (clears his throat) Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.",Joey,,,,,
" Dude, come on! French it u-up!",Joey,,,,,
 Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!,Joey,,,,,
 Sa-sa-saw!,Joey,,,,,
 Ah. All right. But my French was good?,Joey,,,,,
 (to Phoebe) Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.,Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
 No.,Joey,,,,,
 Would fall off a lot.,Joey,,,,,
 That I can do.,Joey,,,,,
" All right, watch me! (he takes a full container of milk from the fridge) Okay, you time me. Ready?",Joey,,,,,
 (enters) Guess what? (they all look expectantly at him) I finally got that seed out of my teeth.,Joey,,,,,
 (enters) Hey guys.,Joey,,,,,
" No, thank you.",Joey,,,,,
" But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.",Joey,,,,,
" You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!",Joey,,,,,
" What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that ""thing"". What is it?",Joey,,,,,
 I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye! (he leaves),Joey,,,,,
" Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.",Joey,,,,,
 Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.,Joey,,,,,
 Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.,Joey,,,,,
" Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark. (starts feeling around him like he's in a completely dark room, touching Chandler, who backs out and hits him)",Joey,,,,,
 (squinting his eyes) Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!,Joey,,,,,
" (glares at him for a moment, then admits grudgingly) Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.",Joey,,,,,
" FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. (He turns his back to them and starts humming) Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...",Joey,,,,,
 no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm,Joey,,,,,
" (turns the card around, obviously had the wrong answer) Ow!",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?",Joey,,,,,
 (understanding) Oh.,Joey,,,,,
" I hate my friends. (They shake on it as if they just made a pact) Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.",Joey,,,,,
" (thinking) Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!",Joey,,,,,
" Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.",Joey,,,,,
" (frustrated) Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?",Joey,,,,,
" What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, yeah, I guess.",Joey,,,,,
" (having difficulty admitting it) Yeah, maybe.",Joey,,,,,
" (In near tears, realizes she is right) I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?",Joey,,,,,
 (his mood changes instantly) Just when I thought we could be friends. (he leaves the room),Joey,,,,,
 (entering) Hey!,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.",Joey,,,,,
" Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.",Joey,,,,,
 (frightened) What?,Joey,,,,,
 That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!,Joey,,,,,
 What? I get my own room?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh my God! (they all hug) Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a s*x swing?",Joey,,,,,
 Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.,Joey,,,,,
" I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?",Joey,,,,,
" Hey bear, I need some career advice.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey, great! All right!",Joey,,,,,
" What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married (to Phoebe) Congratulations! (pointing to Monica and Chandler)... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...",Joey,,,,,
" Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.",Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.",Joey,,,,,
" Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. (He walks out, and Rachel follows him)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey Phoebe.,Joey,,,,,
 I’m just mad at my agent.,Joey,,,,,
 There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn’t even be put up for it! She’d better have a good reason.,Joey,,,,,
" Well (taking his cell phone out of a pocket) I’m wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.",Joey,,,,,
 Ok. Why?,Joey,,,,,
 I love that saying!,Joey,,,,,
 Hello?,Joey,,,,,
 I was just gonna call you! That’s weird.,Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, actually I am!",Joey,,,,,
" That’s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.",Joey,,,,,
" No, no, look. All I’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok? And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it.",Joey,,,,,
" I’m saying that… (pause). This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you’re fired. Goodbye. (he hangs up the phone).",Joey,,,,,
" Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.",Joey,,,,,
" I don’t know. She’s got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I’m guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I’m gonna call her and hire her again.",Joey,,,,,
 Why?,Joey,,,,,
 (impressed) You blow me away.,Joey,,,,,
" I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. (Phoebe stops herself from laughing and leaves)",Joey,,,,,
" Oh my God. (Still in shock when his mobile rings, he picks it up) Hello?",Joey,,,,,
 Estelle?,Joey,,,,,
" (still scared) Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?",Joey,,,,,
" No, no, no! (Starts looking around the room, terrified) Don't drop by, don't drop by!",Joey,,,,,
" Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?",Joey,,,,,
" Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. (Hangs up and reads the phone display) ""out of area"". Boy, I'll say.",Joey,,,,,
" Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... (Joey looks at the photograph) ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. (Joey looks for his notes. The man next to him is chewing something.) Dude, where's my speech? (the man swallows something and looks at Joey.) That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody. (he applauds and Al shows that there's nothing left in his mouth.)",Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,,,Monica,,
" Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.",Joey,,,,,
" Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.",Joey,,,,,
 Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?,Joey,,,,,
" Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! (he glances at his watch and sees the time) Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! (he stands, ready to go). Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.",Joey,,,,,
" Dude, chill! (to Ross) Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.",Joey,,,,,
 Oh.. My sister's raccoon.,Joey,,,,,
 Hey Phoebe!,Joey,,Chandler,,,
  Ooooohh!,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 What is it?,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 We already knew that! (they hug),Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Shut-out!! (They both start heading for their rooms.),Joey,,Chandler,,,
 G’night.,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 (stopping her) Oh no-no-no-no!,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Oh no-no-no! (Monica mutes the TV and they tentatively look behind them),Joey,,Chandler,,,
 What?!,Joey,,Chandler,,,
" Yeah, that’s her.",Joey,,Chandler,,,
 (start to sing) Hey! Happy birthday ...,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 Hi.,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!,Joey,,Chandler,,,
 (jumping up from behind the couch) Merry Christmas!!,Joey,,,Monica,,
 Are you all right?,Joey,,,Monica,,
 (Ad-lib good-byes) (Phoebe leaves),Joey,,,,Phoebe,

 Okay,Joey,,,,,Rachel
 Go Joe!!!,Joey,Ross,,,,

 Hey!,Joey,Ross,,,,
 (faking dissapointment) Okay.,Joey,Ross,,,,
 Die Hard!!!!!!,Joey,Ross,,,,
 Kristen Lang.,Joey,Ross,,,,
 No. No.,Joey,Ross,,,,
 The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. <whiny voice> And they all got to meet Santa!,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
 Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.,Joey,,,,,
 Yeah.,Joey,,,,,
" Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.",Joey,,,,,
 Uh.. who has to die for me to get her?,Joey,,,,,
 Sorry.,Joey,Ross,Chandler,,,
" (sitting in living room, imitating Paolo) Mma, Mma, Mmaah",Joey,Ross,Chandler,,,
 Shhhh!,Joey,,,,,
 Hey!,Joey,Ross,,,,Rachel
 Ohhh.,Joey,,Chandler,,,
" I'm surprised to, but yet here I am.",Joey,,,,,
" I know you botched that operation on purpose. I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. I don't care if you are my brother.",Joey,,,,,
 Stopping you from marrying the wrong man and making the biggest mistake of your life.,Joey,,,,,
 You don't love him!,Joey,,,,,
 I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge.,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, what about this one.",Joey,,,,,
 Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question...,Joey,,,,,
 Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been?,Joey,,,,,
" Yes, you do.Yes...you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I...because I can't stop loving you.",Joey,,,,,
" Tell me to stop, just...tell me to stop. (he's about to kiss her)",Joey,,,,,
 I can't believe you married him.,Joey,,,,,
 So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.,Joey,,,,,
" How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now.",Joey,,,,,
 What kind?,Joey,,,,,
" Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.",Joey,Ross,,,,
 Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?",,,,Monica,,
" Did he give you that whole ""You're-not-up-to-this"" thing again?",,,,Monica,,
" Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.",,,,Monica,,
 Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.,,,,Monica,,
" [looking out window] Oh, god help us.",,,,Monica,,
 Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!,,,,Monica,,
 What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?,,,,Monica,,
 Which?,,,,Monica,,
" You've never met Bob, have you?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly--",,,,Monica,,
 --horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.,,,,Monica,,
" [to Joey] He is so cute. [to Angela and Bob] So, where did you guys grow up?",,,,Monica,,
" How, how did that happen?",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.",,,,Monica,,
" It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.",,,,Monica,,
 Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.,,,,Monica,,
" Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my god.,,,,Monica,,
 Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.,,,,Monica,,
 Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's--not really true, is it?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my god, what were you thinking?",,,,Monica,,
 [hits him lightly] Oh!,,,,Monica,,
 [leaving] I'm outta here.,,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.",,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
" We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.",,,,Monica,,
" [notices his head] Oh, I'm sorry.",,,,Monica,,
" Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.",,,,Monica,,
" [into phone] Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. [hangs up]",,,,Monica,,
 Hello?,,,,Monica,,
 [to everyone] It's Chandler! [on phone] Are you OK?,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 I have no idea what you just said.,,,,Monica,,
" OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?,,,,Monica,,
 You did not go!,,,,Monica,,
 Outside.,,,,Monica,,
 Why not?,,,,Monica,,
 And that would be?,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, what's going on?",,,,Monica,,
 About what?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! I love him!,,,,Monica,,
 My surprise party!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh stop it. Joey already told me.,,,,Monica,,
" No, you are not. We tell you stuff.",,,,Monica,,
 [to Ross] This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.,,,,Monica,,
 [smitten] Hi!,,,,Monica,,
 Hi!,,,,Monica,,
 Hi!,,,,Monica,,
" If you want, I'll do it.",,,,Monica,,
" Rach, why does my swizzel stick have an eraser?",,,,Monica,,
" Uh, Chandler... you've been there for five years.",,,,Monica,,
 Um... hi there.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, yeah! Well, what kind of food is he looking for?",,,,Monica,,
 [excited] Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I love my life, I love my life!",,,,Monica,,
" So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.",,,,Monica,,
" So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.",,,,Monica,,
 I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!,,,,Monica,,
" [to Joey] OK, try this salmon mousse.",,,,Monica,,
 Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, well, is that better?",,,,Monica,,
" [brings a plate of tiny appetizers over] Hey, maybe this'll cheer you up.",,,,Monica,,
 It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.,,,,Monica,,
" [on phone] Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye. [hangs up]",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.",,,,Monica,,
 Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...,,,,Monica,,
" But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.",,,,Monica,,
" [shouting on phone] Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! [hangs up]",,,,Monica,,
 Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.,,,,Monica,,
 Ten dollars an hour.,,,,Monica,,
 Twelve dollars an hour.,,,,Monica,,
" You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... [desperate] twenty dollars an hour.",,,,Monica,,
 Hi Steve!,,,,Monica,,
 [to Steve] This is Rachel.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. [Steve sits, Monica brings over a tray] OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... [Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly]... with just a touch of mints... and... [he finishes]... ginger.",,,,Monica,,
 I'm so glad you liked them!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, well... um, that's all there are of those. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.",,,,Monica,,
 [joining him and taking the taco shells] You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.,,,,Monica,,
" You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...",,,,Monica,,
" No, we don't. [reaches for box]",,,,Monica,,
" Why don't you just have a seat here? [he sits at the table, then tries to secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.] OK... give me the Gummi-bears.",,,,Monica,,
 Give them to me.,,,,Monica,,
" No, give me the...",,,,Monica,,
 [furious] That's it! Dinner is over!,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?",,,,Monica,,
" I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.",,,,Monica,,
 I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?",,,,Monica,,
 What's with the guitar?,,,,Monica,,
 I want a baby.,,,,Monica,,
 Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.,,,,Monica,,
 No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh yeah? When?,,,,Monica,,
 Why won't I be married when I'm 40?,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?",,,,Monica,,
 What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?,,,,Monica,,
 Well?,,,,Monica,,
 Did you go home and change?,,,,Monica,,
" No, I haven't seen him.",,,,Monica,,
 I'm sure they'll be here soon.,,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 Can we come in?,,,,Monica,,
" Ross, can I?",,,,Monica,,
" [getting choked up] Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.",,,,Monica,,
 He is so amazing.,,,,Monica,,
" Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.",,,,Monica,,
" OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...",,,,Monica,,
" Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?,,,,Monica,,
 Man's got a point.,,,,Monica,,
 Joey... we always know what you mean.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
 You're going to China?,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.",,,,Monica,,
" You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.",,,,Monica,,
" [gets up] OK, how does everybody like their burgers?",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?",,,,Monica,,
" So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?",,,,Monica,,
" Y'know, just be there for her.",,,,Monica,,
 Think about it.,,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe he did this.,,,,Monica,,
" I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?",,,,Monica,,
" No, no, wait. [checks Ross's itinerary] His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.",,,,Monica,,
 From here to the airport?,,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.",,,,Monica,,
" Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!",,,,Monica,,
 Another good point.,,,,Monica,,
 Why isn't it working out?,,,,Monica,,
 Is he not cute enough for you?,,,,Monica,,
 Does he not make enough money?,,,,Monica,,
 Is there? Is there someone else?,,,,Monica,,
 Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, from who?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, why?",,,,Monica,,
" [gets up] No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!",,,,Monica,,
" I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.",,,,Monica,,
 Behind my brother's back? [Rachel glares at her] ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.",,,,Monica,,
 Please.,,,,Monica,,
" Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.",,,,Monica,,
 C'mon give me five more. Five more.,,,,Monica,,
 Five more and I'll flash you.,,,,Monica,,
" [to Chandler] Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.",,,,Monica,,
 Only if you say his full name.,,,,Monica,,
 Alright.,,,,Monica,,
 Why not?,,,,Monica,,
" OK, if you say stop, then we stop.",,,,Monica,,
" No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo [Chandler walks out of the apartment, leaving Monica] Woo.",,,,Monica,,
" No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.",,,,Monica,,
" Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, thanks.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, you know.",,,,Monica,,
 [sad] Uh-huh.,,,,Monica,,
" Well no, but um.",,,,Monica,,
" Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .",,,,Monica,,
 Alright.,,,,Monica,,
 OK. Just for a little while.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!",,,,Monica,,
 [getting the wine] Do not start without me. Do not start without me.,,,,Monica,,
 [reading the paper] There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.,,,,Monica,,
 There's an ad for a naked chef?,,,,Monica,,
 Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.,,,,Monica,,
 We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.,,,,Monica,,
" So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.",,,,Monica,,
 I'm sorry?,,,,Monica,,
 Ohh.,,,,Monica,,
 All right. Mmm-mmm.,,,,Monica,,
" [disgusted, trying not to show it] I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.",,,,Monica,,
 [still chewing] Mmm-mmm.,,,,Monica,,
 Wow.,,,,Monica,,
 Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.,,,,Monica,,
 [with false enthusiasm] Mmm.,,,,Monica,,
" Abso...[swallows hard]...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.",,,,Monica,,
" Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.",,,,Monica,,
 How about Mockolate mousse?,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?",,,,Monica,,
 We'll put buckles on it.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" No, I'm sorry.",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my god good?,,,,Monica,,
" You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 This was your idea?,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. You!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?",,,,Monica,,
" Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, uh, I ate some.",,,,Monica,,
 Hello?,,,,Monica,,
" [to Ross] Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.",,,,Monica,,
" Sure, what? Ok, ok. [hangs up the phone] [to Rachel] Music?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.",,,,Monica,,
 Cat hair.,,,,Monica,,
" You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.",,,,Monica,,
" Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believe this will change your mind. [Reads from paper] In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able to achieve brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153...[turns it] sucking.",,,,Monica,,
 Maybe.,,,,Monica,,
 You and me both.,,,,Monica,,
" OK, I'll see you later babe.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.",,,,Monica,,
" And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.",,,,Monica,,
 Really? I only had two glasses.,,,,Monica,,
 So what. So he drank a lot tonight.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.",,,,Monica,,
" Rach, does this have nonfat milk?",,,,Monica,,
" [takes a sip] Mmmm, no.",,,,Monica,,
 You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.,,,,Monica,,
 Bobby.,,,,Monica,,
" Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.",,,,Monica,,
" So, what are you saying now?",,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
 [gasps] You have other friends?,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 What are you talking about?,,,,Monica,,
 It's Fun Bobby.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.",,,,Monica,,
" Alright, here you go, sweetie. [hands Fun Bobby his coffee]",,,,Monica,,
" Oh God, yes!",,,,Monica,,
" Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?",,,,Monica,,
 Oh.... my... God.,,,,Monica,,
 Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?,,,,Monica,,
" But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.",,,,Monica,,
" She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.",,,,Monica,,
 See? They're as different as night and... later that night.,,,,Monica,,
 Bye.,,,,Monica,,
 Do you not see it?,,,,Monica,,
" Yes, I would like something. [looks at Fun Bobby, changes her mind] No, no thank you.",,,,Monica,,
" No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. [to waiter] Just some water.",,,,Monica,,
 [grabs waiter as he's leaving] I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.,,,,Monica,,
 Morning.,,,,Monica,,
" Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.",,,,Monica,,
 Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.,,,,Monica,,
 Sure.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh God, you fell off the wagon.",,,,Monica,,
 What about me?,,,,Monica,,
" What these? [holding up liquor bottles] Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh... shoot.,,,,Monica,,
 OK.,,,,Monica,,
 Take care.,,,,Monica,,
 Well we... we kinda broke up.,,,,Monica,,
 [holding bottles] Does anybody want these?,,,,Monica,,
" [singing] I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...",Joey,,,Monica,Phoebe,
 Ewww!,,,,Monica,Phoebe,
 There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having s*x.",,,,Monica,,
" Are you okay, sweetie?",,,,Monica,,
 (EXPLAINING TO THE OTHERS) Carol moved her stuff out today. (TO ROSS) Let me get you some coffee.,,,,Monica,,
 No you don't.,,,,Monica,,
 Rachel?!,,,,Monica,,
" (POINTING AT RACHEL) De-caff. (TO THE GANG) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (TO RACHEL) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? ",,,,Monica,,
" So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?",,,,Monica,,
 Who wasn't invited to the wedding.,,,,Monica,,
" Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. ",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...",,,,Monica,,
" Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.",,,,Monica,,
" Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!",,,,Monica,,
 Buzz him in!,,,,Monica,,
 Maybe.,,,,Monica,,
 Yes!,,,,Monica,,
" Rach, wait, I can cancel...",,,,Monica,,
" (TO ROSS) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?",,,,Monica,,
 (HORRIFIED) Really?,,,,Monica,,
" Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (THEY ARE ALL LINED UP NEXT TO THE DOOR)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.",,,,Monica,,
 (SHOWS PAUL IN) Two seconds.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
" My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?",,,,Monica,,
 -leg?,,,,Monica,,
 You actually broke her watch?,,,,Monica,,
" What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?",,,,Monica,,
" (SPITS OUT HER DRINK IN SHOCK) Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...",,,,Monica,,
 Being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?,,,,Monica,,
 Wow! I'm glad you smashed her watch! ,,,,Monica,,
" (PAUSE)...Yeah. Yeah, I do.",,,,Monica,,
 I had a really great time last night.,,,,Monica,,
 We'll talk later.,,,,Monica,,
" Shut up, and put my table back.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio.",,,,Monica,,
 So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.,,,,Monica,,
" I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, it's like that. With feelings.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.",,,,Monica,,
 What for?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, welcome back! How was Florida?",,,,Monica,,
 How do you do that?,,,,Monica,,
 You know Paul?,,,,Monica,,
 You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?,,,,Monica,,
" Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?",,,,Monica,,
 Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?,,,,Monica,,
" I just thought he was nice, y'know?",,,,Monica,,
 How'd you pay for them?,,,,Monica,,
 And who pays for that?,,,,Monica,,
" C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.",,,,Monica,,
 You ready?,,,,Monica,,
 Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, that's it. ",,,,Monica,,
 You be okay?,,,,Monica,,
" That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody. (STOMPS ON PAUL'S WATCH AND GOES TO HER ROOM)",,,,Monica,,
" See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?",,,,Monica,,
 What? I-I said you had a-,,,,Monica,,
 (TO PHOEBE) Would you stop?,,,,Monica,,
" What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.",,,,Monica,,
 Absolutely.,,,,Monica,,
 (TAKING DRINK FROM JOEY) Are you through with that?,,,,Monica,,
 Whose little ball of paper is this?!,,,,Monica,,
" Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.",,,,Monica,,
" That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. ",,,,Monica,,
 What? ,,,,Monica,,
" Easy Rach, we'll find it. (TO ALL) Won't we!",,,,Monica,,
 You didn't.,,,,Monica,,
 I gave you one job! (EXAMINING THE LASAGNE THROUGH THE GLASS DISH),,,,Monica,,
 (PUTS DOWN THE lASAGNE) I just... can't do it.,,,,Monica,,
 Wow. That is not a happy hi.,,,,Monica,,
 W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...,,,,Monica,,
 What does she mean by 'involved'?,,,,Monica,,
 Curry.,,,,Monica,,
" I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?",,,,Monica,,
" No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.",,,,Monica,,
" Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?",,,,Monica,,
" I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.",,,,Monica,,
 What's that supposed to mean?,,,,Monica,,
 No it's not. ,,,,Monica,,
" (TRYING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (DIGS HER ELBOW INTO HIS HAND) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?",,,,Monica,,
" Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (TO ROSS) -I'd want yours.",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.",,,,Monica,,
 (WELLING UP) Mm-hmm.,,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 Am not!,,,,Monica,,
 (PUSHES HIM AND STARTS TO CRY) Oh shut up!,,,,Monica,,
" Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'. ",,,,Monica,,
" Uh, Ross.",,,,Monica,,
" No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.",,,,Monica,,
 What did they do to you?,,,,Monica,,
 We're with you. We got it.,,,,Monica,,
 (PULLING HIM UP) Hey. Whaddya doing?,,,,Monica,,
" Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.",,,,Monica,,
" 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.",,,,Monica,,
" Let's see, today's Monday... Never.",,,,Monica,,
 No. Not after what happened with Steve.,,,,Monica,,
" Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.",,,,Monica,,
 Nope. Schhorry.,,,,Monica,,
" I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.",,,,Monica,,
" I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.",,,,Monica,,
 Do you all promise?,,,,Monica,,
 (SHOUTS TO CHANDLER) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey. It's him. (TO INTERCOM) Who is it?,,,,Monica,,
" (TO ALL) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.",,,,Monica,,
" Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.",,,,Monica,,
" (AT THE DOOR, TO ALAN, WHO IS LEAVING) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (TO ALL) Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?",,,,Monica,,
 C'mon!,,,,Monica,,
 Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?,,,,Monica,,
 Really!,,,,Monica,,
 Hi.. how was the game?,,,,Monica,,
 Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?,,,,Monica,,
 Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..,,,,Monica,,
" ..I dunno, a little too Alan?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, why is it unfair?",,,,Monica,,
 Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like. ",,,,Monica,,
" Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.",,,,Monica,,
 I know.. it's gonna be really hard.,,,,Monica,,
" No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey. Where's Joey?,,,,Monica,,
 Thanks. (GOES TO FETCH HIM),,,,Monica,,
 Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.,,,,Monica,,
 (TURNS OFF TV) Okay..,,,,Monica,,
" Please, guys, we have to talk.",,,,Monica,,
" Alright, we have to talk.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.",,,,Monica,,
" No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.",,,,Monica,,
" Look, I- I could go on pretending-",,,,Monica,,
" -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!",,,,Monica,,
 I'm sorry..,,,,Monica,,
 I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.,,,,Monica,,
 Are you guys gonna be okay?,,,,Monica,,
 (DUBIOUS) I understand.,,,,Monica,,
" I'm, I'm really sorry.",,,,Monica,,
 Relieved?,,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, y'know..",,,,Monica,,
 He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (DUBIOUS LOOK),,,,Monica,,
 Alright. Phoebe?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?",,,,Monica,,
 ..Excuse me?,,,,Monica,,
 How does she do that?,,,,Monica,,
 Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.,,,,Monica,,
 What's going on with you?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.",,,,Monica,,
" Wow, you worked in a mine?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, yeah.",,,,Monica,,
 (TO PHOEBE) I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? (SHE AND PHOEBE SCREAM) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (POURS THE CONTENTS OF THE BLENDER INTO GLASSES)",,,,Monica,,
" Weeeell, it's rum, and-",,,,Monica,,
" We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister.. (PHONE RINGS, MONICA GOES TO ANSWER)",,,,Monica,,
" Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.",,,,Monica,,
" (PHONE) Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? ...Yes, hold on. (TO RACH) Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.",,,,Monica,,
" That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.",,,,Monica,,
" (PAUSES, THEN, TO PHONE) Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?",,,,Monica,,
 You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!,,,,Monica,,
" Ah, the other Jack.",,,,Monica,,
" So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.",,,,Monica,,
 ...Pheebs?,,,,Monica,,
" No, you were right. I don't have a plan. (A KNOCK AT THE DOOR)",,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe?,,,,Monica,,
 Do you have a plan?,,,,Monica,,
 (LEAPS THE COUCH AND RUNS UP) Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos'?,,,,Monica,,
" Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?",,,,Monica,,
 Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?,,,,Monica,,
 (STAGGERED) Oh God.,,,,Monica,,
 Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!,,,,Monica,,
 I see pizza!,,,,Monica,,
" White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?",,,,Monica,,
 Please tell me it's his mother.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, no...",,,,Monica,,
 Light still out?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh. Maybe they're- napping.,,,,Monica,,
 I think he's shy.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!",,,,Monica,,
 What?! You slept with Jason?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, that's nice!",,,,Monica,,
 Excuse me?!,,,,Monica,,
" Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!",,,,Monica,,
 Where?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!",,,,Monica,,
" Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.",,,,Monica,,
" Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.",,,,Monica,,
 You could do that!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?",,,,Monica,,
 Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.,,,,Monica,,
" Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?",,,,Monica,,
 What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?,,,,Monica,,
" Good for you, Joey.",,,,Monica,,
" We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!",,,,Monica,,
 ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.,,,,Monica,,
 How-how did that happen?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. (MOVES IT) Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.",,,,Monica,,
" You guys, I am not that bad!",,,,Monica,,
 That is so unfair!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.",,,,Monica,,
 Why not?,,,,Monica,,
 I could do that.,,,,Monica,,
 Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.,,,,Monica,,
 STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, what's the part?",,,,Monica,,
 (TRYING NOT TO LAUGH) Oh my God.,,,,Monica,,
" Alright, alright, alright... ",,,,Monica,,
 For what?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.",,,,Monica,,
 He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!,,,,Monica,,
 I warned you...,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you got the whole night, huh?",,,,Monica,,
" Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that. ",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?",,,,Monica,,
 Maybe this wasn't your shot.,,,,Monica,,
" I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys. ",,,,Monica,,
 (DETERMINED) Uh-huh!,,,,Monica,,
" Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (GOES TO HER ROOM)",,,,Monica,,
" (HUMS FOR A WHILE, THEN GIVES UP.) (VOICEOVER) If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! (BURIES HER HEAD IN HER PILLOW) ",,,,Monica,,
 I did.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.",,,,Monica,,
" Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. ",,,,Monica,,
" Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.",,,,Monica,,
" How-how are you, Mom?",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Nothing.,,,,Monica,,
" She is unbelievable, our mother is...",,,,Monica,,
 Oh God!,,,,Monica,,
 The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. ,,,,Monica,,
 I know.,,,,Monica,,
" G'bye, Nana. [She kisses her on the forehead]",,,,Monica,,
 Ross!,,,,Monica,,
 We checked. A lot.,,,,Monica,,
 Dad!,,,,Monica,,
 You what?,,,,Monica,,
 Define fun.,,,,Monica,,
" ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.",,,,Monica,,
 That's probably what they'll say.,,,,Monica,,
 Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?,,,,Monica,,
 Are these the shoes?,,,,Monica,,
 It was a really beautiful service.,,,,Monica,,
" Wow, those pills really worked, huh?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.",,,,Monica,,
 That sounds like Nana.,,,,Monica,,
 ...I can imagine.,,,,Monica,,
" That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?",,,,Monica,,
" How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.",,,,Monica,,
 Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?,,,,Monica,,
 Huh.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I think so.",,,,Monica,,
 Thank you. They're yours.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. [Reads the back] 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'. ",,,,Monica,,
" Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?",,,,Monica,,
" Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?",,,,Monica,,
" Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.",,,,Monica,,
 I am not wrong.,,,,Monica,,
" No, I just talked to them.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those ""healthy, healthy, healthy guys""?",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.",,,,Monica,,
" You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?",,,,Monica,,
" And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?",,,,Monica,,
" So you're free Thursday, then.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Rach, did you make your money?",,,,Monica,,
" Rach, here's your mail.",,,,Monica,,
" (insistently) No, here's your mail.",,,,Monica,,
 (gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?,,,,Monica,,
 We all chipped in.,,,,Monica,,
 (to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.,,,,Monica,,
" (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.",,,,Monica,,
" Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?",,,,Monica,,
" All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.",,,,Monica,,
 That's not a question.,,,,Monica,,
" All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.",,,,Monica,,
 Ah!,,,,Monica,,
" What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!",,,,Monica,,
 Why would we do that?,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.",,,,Monica,,
 Got the keys? or Got the keys!,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?",,,,Monica,,
 No I don't.,,,,Monica,,
" No I didn't. I asked, ""got the ke-eys?""",,,,Monica,,
 (panicked) The oven is on.,,,,Monica,,
" Well then get it, get it!",,,,Monica,,
 (angry) Joey!,,,,Monica,,
 Can you go any faster with that?,,,,Monica,,
 Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?,,,,Monica,,
 I swear you said you had the keys.,,,,Monica,,
 Why would I have the keys?,,,,Monica,,
 But I didn't.,,,,Monica,,
 Why?,,,,Monica,,
 Why?,,,,Monica,,
" Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...",,,,Monica,,
" Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.",,,,Monica,,
" No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?",,,,Monica,,
" Stop it, stop it, stop it!",,,,Monica,,
" Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!",,,,Monica,,
 (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?,,,,Monica,,
 Make a wish?,,,,Monica,,
 W-wait. What is that?,,,,Monica,,
" No, no, I don't.",,,,Monica,,
" Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?",,,,Monica,,
 Why don't you just get a roommate?,,,,Monica,,
" So, how'd it go?",,,,Monica,,
 So what are you gonna be?,,,,Monica,,
 I think it's romantic.,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!",,,,Monica,,
 Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!,,,,Monica,,
 Do you always have to bring him here?,,,,Monica,,
" I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 What's the matter?,,,,Monica,,
 Vividly.,,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 That thing is not coming in here.,,,,Monica,,
 I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.,,,,Monica,,
 Alright. Just keep him away from me.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?",,,,Monica,,
 Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!,,,,Monica,,
 Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!,,,,Monica,,
 So I'm kissing everyone?,,,,Monica,,
 Why?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.",,,,Monica,,
" He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.",,,,Monica,,
 We are not going to whistle.,,,,Monica,,
 No!,,,,Monica,,
 No!,,,,Monica,,
 (Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!,,,,Monica,,
" Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, what are you doing?",,,,Monica,,
" I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!",,,,Monica,,
 I wish all guys could be like him.,,,,Monica,,
 He doesn't have anyone.,,,,Monica,,
 Last night.,,,,Monica,,
" Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.",,,,Monica,,
 Nah... not-not special enough.,,,,Monica,,
 Waaay too special.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 (Entering) What are you guys doing here?,,,,Monica,,
 ...What did I ask?,,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing here?,,,,Monica,,
 I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?,,,,Monica,,
 How would I know? I-I wasn't here.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" (Reading) 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.",,,,Monica,,
" (Reads) Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.",,,,Monica,,
 Hello.,,,,Monica,,
" No, you?",,,,Monica,,
 You just asked me.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh! You're awake!,,,,Monica,,
 You look good!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, sorry.",,,,Monica,,
 I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.,,,,Monica,,
 I got you the foot massager.,,,,Monica,,
 I read to you.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, my pleasure.",,,,Monica,,
" ""See you around?""",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, ""That was nice?"" Admit something to me? ""I'll call you?""",,,,Monica,,
" This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and ""See you around!"" Let's go, Phoebe.",,,,Monica,,
 What's a 'niffle'?,,,,Monica,,
" Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. (pauses, listens to person on phone) Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.",,,,Monica,,
" Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, Aunt Syl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?",,,,Monica,,
" So, did I hear Poconos?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, that's a big step.",,,,Monica,,
 And Monica knows...,,,,Monica,,
" Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.",,,,Monica,,
" I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, what's the matter?",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, what is it?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, what happened?",,,,Monica,,
 Are you sure?,,,,Monica,,
 Was it...?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh!,,,,Monica,,
" So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?",,,,Monica,,
 Heads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! (points at Chandler) You suck!,,,,Monica,,
" We should get over there and see if she's okay. (switching places with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, high-fives with Ross) Game! Come on. (Monica and Phoebe leave)",,,,Monica,,
" Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in front of her chest), Ok, that is either, ""How could you?"" or, ""Enormous breasts!"" Here he comes!",,,,Monica,,
" Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a lasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you're right.",,,,Monica,,
" Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?",,,,Monica,,
 Yes! And that would be a shut-down!,,,,Monica,,
" Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!",,,,Monica,,
" You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone.",,,,Monica,,
" So, you think you'll do it on his couch?",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, how long are you in the city?",,,,Monica,,
 Hello?,,,,Monica,,
 C'mon up.,,,,Monica,,
" Waitwait, go back to that sibling thing.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh! So you think I'm a failure!,,,,Monica,,
" Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!",,,,Monica,,
 You're welcome.,,,,Monica,,
 Hate that guy! [Throws another cookie],,,,Monica,,
 Hi...May I help you?,,,,Monica,,
 Okay...who are you?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, c'mon in.",,,,Monica,,
 How's it going?,,,,Monica,,
" Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. ",,,,Monica,,
" So you talked to your dad, huh.",,,,Monica,,
 How's it going?,,,,Monica,,
 Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!,,,,Monica,,
" Hello, Joey.",,,,Monica,,
 You can not do this.,,,,Monica,,
 Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.,,,,Monica,,
" But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.",,,,Monica,,
 Which one was Pete Carney?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-""I-win""-guy. [imitating] ""I win! I win!"" I went out with the guy for two months--I didn't get to win once.",,,,Monica,,
 I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.,,,,Monica,,
" There's more beer, right?",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, well, what kind of ritual?",,,,Monica,,
 Burning's good.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, Chandler, sorry.",,,,Monica,,
" Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.",,,,Monica,,
" Rache, come see who's out here!",,,,Monica,,
 I'll be right back.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. [to Chandler] He just happened to call.",,,,Monica,,
" All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.",,,,Monica,,
 Can we just start throwing things in?,,,,Monica,,
" Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.",,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure--",,,,Monica,,
" You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.",,,,Monica,,
 They're nice guys.,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, look, this could be a really long game.",,,,Monica,,
" Ross, that's my jacket.",,,,Monica,,
" Ross, your little creature's got the remote again.",,,,Monica,,
 Great.,,,,Monica,,
" No, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year's but obviously someone forgot.",,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe you. You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job yet?,,,,Monica,,
" Congratulations, I think you've found the world's thinnest argument.",,,,Monica,,
" I'll get it. Hi, Mr. Heckles.",,,,Monica,,
" We're not doing anything. We're just sitting around talking, quietly.",,,,Monica,,
 Goodbye Mr. Heckles.,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, I think I get how to do this.",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, Pheebs, they're gone. Are you all right?",,,,Monica,,
" Come on, you gotta talk to Joey.",,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing out here. Would you come back inside?",,,,Monica,,
" Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or ankle or something.",,,,Monica,,
" All right. Name, address...Ok, in case of emergency call?",,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh. I love you. Insurance?",,,,Monica,,
" I have no idea, but x-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.",,,,Monica,,
 There's not much we can do.,,,,Monica,,
 No no no no no no no no no.,,,,Monica,,
 That's insurance fraud.,,,,Monica,,
 Ok. Ok. I hate this.,,,,Monica,,
" Hi. Um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms.",,,,Monica,,
" I am really an idiot. You see, I was filling out my friend's forms, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.",,,,Monica,,
" Yep, that's me. I am that stupid.",,,,Monica,,
" Yes, yes she is.",,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you.,,,,Monica,,
" Uh, you left out the stupid part.",,,,Monica,,
" I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. I say we blow off the dates.",,,,Monica,,
" Come on, she'll be here any minute.",,,,Monica,,
" Well maybe we can make a ""b"" out of one of those roses.",,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, the cute doctors are here.",,,,Monica,,
" Hi, come on in.",,,,Monica,,
" It's uh, well, uh, why don't you tell them? After all, it is your ankle.",,,,Monica,,
 It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.,,,,Monica,,
" A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, ok?",,,,Monica,,
" I said we are not going to do it. Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar. Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?",,,,Monica,,
" (laughing) Oh, God, I am so spoiled. That's it.",,,,Monica,,
 I used to wet my bed.,,,,Monica,,
 We both do that.,,,,Monica,,
" Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um, there's something that I've been meaning to tell you. Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Drestin and I had s*x on your bed.",,,,Monica,,
" Ross, he's got the remote again.",,,,Monica,,
 Find out what they want.,,,,Monica,,
" Hello, this is Monica. Yeah? Oh, ok, yes, we'll be right down. Thank you.",,,,Monica,,
 We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you.,,,,Monica,,
" You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on an admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I, I put the wrong name again. 'Cause um...",,,,Monica,,
 I am. I'm that stupid.,,,,Monica,,
 What's goin' on?,,,,Monica,,
 Michael.,,,,Monica,,
 Monica.,,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, guys.",,,,Monica,,
 Lots of responses.,,,,Monica,,
 [reading]: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No. [crumpes up letter],,,,Monica,,
" Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!",,,,Monica,,
" I mean, that's a typical guy response.",,,,Monica,,
" So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.",,,,Monica,,
" Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.",,,,Monica,,
" Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...",,,,Monica,,
" [throws down her cards] Dammit, dammit, dammit!",,,,Monica,,
" Hell no, we'll pay!",,,,Monica,,
 And you know what? We want a rematch.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Please! I am not as bad as Ross.,,,,Monica,,
" That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.",,,,Monica,,
 You're kidding! Where? Where?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, Rachel!",,,,Monica,,
" Well, what's the job?",,,,Monica,,
" OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. [opens door] Hi!",,,,Monica,,
 I don't think so.,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...",,,,Monica,,
" OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.",,,,Monica,,
" Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?",,,,Monica,,
" You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.",,,,Monica,,
" OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?",,,,Monica,,
" Excuse me, where are you going?",,,,Monica,,
" Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?",,,,Monica,,
" Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. [deals cards]",,,,Monica,,
 Me too.,,,,Monica,,
 [slams down cards] I hate this game!,,,,Monica,,
" Sorry, Rach.",,,,Monica,,
" Alright, check.",,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, there's nothing in it.",,,,Monica,,
" OK, here you go. Good luck.",,,,Monica,,
" [pointing at the drawing, upset] Bye... bye... BIRDIE.",,,,Monica,,
" That, you get? That, you get?",,,,Monica,,
" Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?,,,,Monica,,
 What is it?,,,,Monica,,
 Barry who you almost-?,,,,Monica,,
" And Mindy, your maid of-?",,,,Monica,,
" [Takes it] That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. [Sees Rachel's look] Lucky. To have had a friend like you.",,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 Wonderful!,,,,Monica,,
 There was nudity!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?",,,,Monica,,
 Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?,,,,Monica,,
 Which ones?,,,,Monica,,
 He- he pooped in my shoe.,,,,Monica,,
 Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.",,,,Monica,,
" Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?",,,,Monica,,
 No!,,,,Monica,,
 A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?,,,,Monica,,
" Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.",,,,Monica,,
" Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?",,,,Monica,,
" Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.",,,,Monica,,
 The Luisa from home room!,,,,Monica,,
" No, none at all.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!",,,,Monica,,
" Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?",,,,Monica,,
 Marcel?,,,,Monica,,
 Whaaat!,,,,Monica,,
 What is it?,,,,Monica,,
" Look, Phoebe!",,,,Monica,,
 What're you gonna do?,,,,Monica,,
" Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! [Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe] Are you okay?",,,,Monica,,
 Oh gosh.,,,,Monica,,
 This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?,,,,Monica,,
 That's because I'm in front of them.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, high school was not my favourite time.",,,,Monica,,
" Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?",,,,Monica,,
 (LOOKING OUT OF WINDOW) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!,,,,Monica,,
 So have you called her yet?,,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.,,,,Monica,,
" Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!",,,,Monica,,
 How'd it go?,,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex- best friend?",,,,Monica,,
 THAT's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!,,,,Monica,,
" (RE WINDOW) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!",,,,Monica,,
" Great, now he's waving back.",,,,Monica,,
 What kinda stuff..?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.",,,,Monica,,
" Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.",,,,Monica,,
" (WANDERING IN AFTER HER) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?",,,,Monica,,
 Uh huh.,,,,Monica,,
" You had s*x in his CHAIR?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?",,,,Monica,,
 Brrrrrrr!,,,,Monica,,
" Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.",,,,Monica,,
 Why don't you just take it with you?,,,,Monica,,
 Why don't you just call her?,,,,Monica,,
 Do you?,,,,Monica,,
 Don't you have to pee?,,,,Monica,,
 Just like you told her you did! (CHANDLER GIVES HER A LOOK) ... Just pointing out the irony.,,,,Monica,,
 So she's a woman! So what?,,,,Monica,,
 Joey!!,,,,Monica,,
 The green dress? Really?,,,,Monica,,
 (WAVES DISMISSIVELY TO SIDNEY) Nooo!,,,,Monica,,
 You okay?,,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
 Aww... (THEY HUG),,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, there you go!",,,,Monica,,
 I have no idea. But look how much they spent!,,,,Monica,,
 I know. It's just such reckless spending.,,,,Monica,,
 That's me.,,,,Monica,,
" Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.",,,,Monica,,
 This woman's living my life.,,,,Monica,,
" She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.",,,,Monica,,
 Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?,,,,Monica,,
" This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.",,,,Monica,,
" Hi. [On the phone] Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.",,,,Monica,,
" [Hushes her] Alright, great. Thanks a lot. [Hangs up] I'm going to tap class.",,,,Monica,,
" This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.",,,,Monica,,
 What d'you think?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I'm not getting this!",,,,Monica,,
 Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?,,,,Monica,,
 Great. It's gym class all over again.,,,,Monica,,
 Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. It's Dutch.,,,,Monica,,
" Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.",,,,Monica,,
" Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this- with this amazing spirit.",,,,Monica,,
 It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!,,,,Monica,,
 ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!,,,,Monica,,
 'Scuse me?,,,,Monica,,
" Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.",,,,Monica,,
 Uh-huh.,,,,Monica,,
 Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.,,,,Monica,,
 Yo- hooo!,,,,Monica,,
 Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.,,,,Monica,,
 Noooo! [Comes closer and whispers] I'm lying. I am so drunk.,,,,Monica,,
 Water rules!,,,,Monica,,
 Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.,,,,Monica,,
" No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!",,,,Monica,,
 Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.,,,,Monica,,
 They've arrested Monica.,,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 How are you?,,,,Monica,,
 Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.,,,,Monica,,
" I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.",,,,Monica,,
" No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theatre!",,,,Monica,,
" I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, not... worried, just... wondering.",,,,Monica,,
 Not necessarily...,,,,Monica,,
" Um, I'm not actually Amish.",,,,Monica,,
 In. [She joins in the dancing. She still flounders],,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!",,,,Monica,,
 Tell him.,,,,Monica,,
 Just...please tell him.,,,,Monica,,
" Look at you, you won't even look at him.",,,,Monica,,
" Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, theyīre still extinct.'",,,,Monica,,
" All right, Iīll see you guys later. [raises]",,,,Monica,,
 Thank you.,,,,Monica,,
 Heīs... our age.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, heīs a senior in college.",,,,Monica,,
" No, of course not. Itīs not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I canīt pass for 22?",,,,Monica,,
 I am 26.,,,,Monica,,
" Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, beltīs to tight, gotta change the belt. Did i turn the fish? [goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner] No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" I donīt know. Look heīs a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You donīt plan these things.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 Did not.,,,,Monica,,
 How was that possible?,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Unless--,,,,Monica,,
" Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, Iīm going to, so...",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'Iīm secretly married to a goat'?",,,,Monica,,
 Ethan--,,,,Monica,,
 Are you a virgin?,,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
 You keep saying that.,,,,Monica,,
" Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.",,,,Monica,,
 No no. Nothing wrong about that. ,,,,Monica,,
" Um, okay, here it goes. Iīm not 22. Iīm, Iīm 25... and thirteen months. ",,,,Monica,,
" But I figured, you know, that shouldnīt change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.",,,,Monica,,
 Youīre not a senior?,,,,Monica,,
 Ok...ay.,,,,Monica,,
" What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had s*x with somebody that wasnīt alive during the Bicentennial.",,,,Monica,,
" Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, thatīs different. My lie didnīt make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?",,,,Monica,,
 Donīt say it. [closes Ethanīs mouth with her hand],,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldnīt even be here, itīs a school night. Oh god, oh god. Iīm like those women that you see with shiny guys like Chad. Iīm Joan Collins.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh.,,,,Monica,,
" No. You know, sometimes just things doesnīt work out.",,,,Monica,,
" Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?",,,,Monica,,
 Arenīt you gonna--,,,,Monica,,
 That was gonna be my opener.,,,,Monica,,
 It was.,,,,Monica,,
" Ethan, itīs um... itīs icky.",,,,Monica,,
" This isnīt easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really--",,,,Monica,,
 --love you.,,,,Monica,,
" I canīt belive it, Iīm gonna be an aunt. Iīm gonna have like a nephew.",,,,Monica,,
" I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross.",,,,Monica,,
" Guys, you got your hair cut.",,,,Monica,,
" This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?",,,,Monica,,
 It's just an expression.,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebes, you know what I'm thinking?",,,,Monica,,
" No, although now that's what I'm thinking.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?",,,,Monica,,
 Why not?,,,,Monica,,
 No you're not.,,,,Monica,,
" Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.",,,,Monica,,
" Please, just a little bit off the back.",,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, how did this happen?",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.",,,,Monica,,
" My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't--but this is about your horrible mistake.",,,,Monica,,
" You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.",,,,Monica,,
 I promise.,,,,Monica,,
 What? I didn't say anything.,,,,Monica,,
" I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.",,,,Monica,,
 How who wears it?,,,,Monica,,
 Demi Moore is not a he.,,,,Monica,,
 That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my god!,,,,Monica,,
" She's the actress who was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost.",,,,Monica,,
 I KNOW!,,,,Monica,,
 Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you. My hair is very amused.,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, um, I'll go with you.",,,,Monica,,
" It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?",,,,Monica,,
 But I'm--,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.",,,,Monica,,
 You're welcome.,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.",,,,Monica,,
" We were shopping, and we had lunch.",,,,Monica,,
 You had a salad.,,,,Monica,,
" Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju-- Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.",,,,Monica,,
" Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, where is everybody?",,,,Monica,,
" Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.",,,,Monica,,
 You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.,,,,Monica,,
 That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.,,,,Monica,,
 Judy.,,,,Monica,,
 Julie.,,,,Monica,,
 Jody.,,,,Monica,,
" Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.",,,,Monica,,
" Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out.",,,,Monica,,
 That is not true!,,,,Monica,,
 Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?,,,,Monica,,
" Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanna, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.",,,,Monica,,
 I don't know what else to say.,,,,Monica,,
" I feel terrible, I really do.",,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?",,,,Monica,,
 It's that terrible?,,,,Monica,,
" Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.",,,,Monica,,
" Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?",,,,Monica,,
 I'd do anything for you.,,,,Monica,,
 So how was Joan?,,,,Monica,,
 How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?,,,,Monica,,
" Hello, Mr. Heckles.",,,,Monica,,
 We're not doing anything.,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.",,,,Monica,,
" Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.",,,,Monica,,
 Mr. Heckles.,,,,Monica,,
 That's terrible.,,,,Monica,,
 What can we do for you?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, what about his family?",,,,Monica,,
" I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!",,,,Monica,,
" Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.",,,,Monica,,
 It doesn't go with any of my stuff.,,,,Monica,,
 You don't have any stuff.,,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 Mmmmm.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?",,,,Monica,,
 Hide the Lamp.,,,,Monica,,
 Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, tell her!",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.",,,,Monica,,
 You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.,,,,Monica,,
 You are not a freak. You're a guy.,,,,Monica,,
" Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.",,,,Monica,,
" No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.",,,,Monica,,
 You made it!,,,,Monica,,
" No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.",,,,Monica,,
 That's fine.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.",,,,Monica,,
" I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.",,,,Monica,,
" Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?",,,,Monica,,
" Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, didn't you?",,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe you didn't tell me.,,,,Monica,,
 What have I not told you?,,,,Monica,,
" Wait a minute, who told you? [turns to Chandler who's looking sheepish] You are dead meat.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.",,,,Monica,,
 That is wild.,,,,Monica,,
" Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.",,,,Monica,,
" I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.",,,,Monica,,
" Hell, I wanna see Joey.",,,,Monica,,
" All I say is, she better get the job.",,,,Monica,,
" You know, it still smells like monkey in there.",,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, that's all we do.",,,,Monica,,
" Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? [Rachel gives her a look from hell] That's fine.",,,,Monica,,
 (enters) Oh my god.,,,,Monica,,
" I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.",,,,Monica,,
" Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.",,,,Monica,,
 Who is also in charge of purchasing.,,,,Monica,,
 Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, sorry.",,,,Monica,,
" Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, thank you!",,,,Monica,,
" All right, what's goin' on?",,,,Monica,,
 Ok.,,,,Monica,,
" If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.",,,,Monica,,
 All of us.,,,,Monica,,
" I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.",,,,Monica,,
" Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.",,,,Monica,,
" It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.",,,,Monica,,
 Like?,,,,Monica,,
 Charity?,,,,Monica,,
" Guys, we bought the tickets.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I guess now we can't go.",,,,Monica,,
 You know what? You're right.,,,,Monica,,
 All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.,,,,Monica,,
 You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.,,,,Monica,,
" You know, the guys are probably having a great time.",,,,Monica,,
 That was amazing!,,,,Monica,,
 Do I know you?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?",,,,Monica,,
 You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.,,,,Monica,,
" Uh, wait, backstage?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?",,,,Monica,,
" Uh, good.",,,,Monica,,
" No, I just, I fell down.",,,,Monica,,
" You know, a party, or--",,,,Monica,,
 That would be the work of a Blowfish.,,,,Monica,,
 It's work.,,,,Monica,,
" (on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.",,,,Monica,,
" Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.",,,,Monica,,
" Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?",,,,Monica,,
 Maye it's me.,,,,Monica,,
 There's my little boy. (Ben starts crying again),,,,Monica,,
 He hates me. My nephew hates me.,,,,Monica,,
 What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?,,,,Monica,,
 That is so funny. Let me see that. (throws the ball out the window),,,,Monica,,
" Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi-- ",,,,Monica,,
" No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special. ",,,,Monica,,
" No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my god.,,,,Monica,,
 Is your tongue swelling up?,,,,Monica,,
" All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.",,,,Monica,,
 Jacket now.,,,,Monica,,
" Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.",,,,Monica,,
" My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally. ",,,,Monica,,
" That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?",,,,Monica,,
" Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!",,,,Monica,,
 Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.,,,,Monica,,
 That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.,,,,Monica,,
" Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?",,,,Monica,,
" Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?",,,,Monica,,
 No. But I remember people telling me about it.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.,,,,Monica,,
 That was you?,,,,Monica,,
" Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.",,,,Monica,,
" Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.",,,,Monica,,
 Cute.,,,,Monica,,
" Ross, that is gorgeous!",,,,Monica,,
" Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, wait a minute honey.",,,,Monica,,
 Wow.,,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 I hope she's OK.,,,,Monica,,
 How do you know exactly what she's going through?,,,,Monica,,
 Just some stuff for the party.,,,,Monica,,
" You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.",,,,Monica,,
" For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.",,,,Monica,,
" Rach, get the heat. [Rachel holds up her hand with wet fingernail polish] Ross, could you turn the heat down please?",,,,Monica,,
" Ross, the heat!",,,,Monica,,
 Well put it back.,,,,Monica,,
" Here, let me try.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.",,,,Monica,,
" No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.",,,,Monica,,
" [carrying an ice cube tray] Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.",,,,Monica,,
" Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. [one of the guest opens the refrigerator] Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next. [she opens the refrigerator and leans into it]",,,,Monica,,
" No, I will not cave.",,,,Monica,,
 Ross.,,,,Monica,,
 [to Ross] Looks like he's playin' baseball.,,,,Monica,,
 Whatever.,,,,Monica,,
" So, wait, you really did like my cookies?",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, I'm sorry.",,,,Monica,,
" Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.",,,,Monica,,
" They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you are so great! [kisses him] Thank you!",,,,Monica,,
" They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.",,,,Monica,,
" Ross, I thought you were over this.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, honey.",,,,Monica,,
" God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.",,,,Monica,,
" [entering] All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.",,,,Monica,,
 Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.,,,,Monica,,
" Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.",,,,Monica,,
" Um, you guys, you know when I said before, ""thank you, but I don't really need your help""?",,,,Monica,,
" Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.",,,,Monica,,
 If you want.,,,,Monica,,
" All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.",,,,Monica,,
" I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.",,,,Monica,,
" All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!",,,,Monica,,
" Joey, speed it up!",,,,Monica,,
 Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?,,,,Monica,,
" [to Ross] All right, you!",,,,Monica,,
" All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called ""pigs in Ross"". All right, ball the melon.",,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.[everyone groans],,,,Monica,,
" You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.",,,,Monica,,
 So we're back on?,,,,Monica,,
" You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.",,,,Monica,,
 Would you look at them?,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?",,,,Monica,,
" All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.",,,,Monica,,
 And the fact that they're both monkeys.,,,,Monica,,
" [reading] 'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'",,,,Monica,,
" This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.",,,,Monica,,
" I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.",,,,Monica,,
" Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.",,,,Monica,,
 Excellent!,,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.",,,,Monica,,
" And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. [throws water in his face]",,,,Monica,,
" Ross, there he is.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.",,,,Monica,,
" Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.",,,,Monica,,
" The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?",,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, he like, totally changed time.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, yeah.",,,,Monica,,
 He could hear me.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.",,,,Monica,,
 So what'd he say?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, thanks anyway.",,,,Monica,,
" Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.",,,,Monica,,
 What did you say?,,,,Monica,,
" Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.",,,,Monica,,
 You sold me out.,,,,Monica,,
 Yes you did. Absolutely.,,,,Monica,,
 Did you just flick me?,,,,Monica,,
 Quit flicking [flicks],,,,Monica,,
 You flicked me first.,,,,Monica,,
 Uh-huh.,,,,Monica,,
 OK.,,,,Monica,,
 Yes.,,,,Monica,,
" Fine,",,,,Monica,,
" I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? [he nods] Can you beat up that guy?",,,,Monica,,
" This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, what made you make the exception for me?",,,,Monica,,
 Say you're sorry.,,,,Monica,,
 Say it.,,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.",,,,Monica,,
 Say you're sorry.,,,,Monica,,
 What're you gonna do?,,,,Monica,,
 You don't have the guts.,,,,Monica,,
 I'll help you fix your sweater.,,,,Monica,,
 I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.,,,,Monica,,
 I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves [pulls Rachel's gloves out of her purse],,,,Monica,,
" Well, bye for me too. [kisses him]",,,,Monica,,
 OK.,,,,Monica,,
 But no. Maybe if I were baking.,,,,Monica,,
 Great.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.",,,,Monica,,
" A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.",,,,Monica,,
 You got it.,,,,Monica,,
" Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.",,,,Monica,,
 That's your call.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.",,,,Monica,,
 They'r alright.,,,,Monica,,
" No really, they're OK.",,,,Monica,,
" Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.",,,,Monica,,
 I'm outa here. [Monica leaves],,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.",,,,Monica,,
" No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.",,,,Monica,,
" Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.",,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
" So, what's this.",,,,Monica,,
" Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, God forbid.",,,,Monica,,
 Where have you been?,,,,Monica,,
" No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.",,,,Monica,,
" Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.",,,,Monica,,
 Because they made me.,,,,Monica,,
 Anything larger back there?,,,,Monica,,
 You have dinosaur checks?,,,,Monica,,
" Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, you got me, put it in.",,,,Monica,,
" You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.",,,,Monica,,
 Over here dad. [he pans over and we see a torso taking up the whole screen],,,,Monica,,
" Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you look so great.",,,,Monica,,
 Oops.,,,,Monica,,
" Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, dad, turn it off.",,,,Monica,,
" Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?",,,,Monica,,
" Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.",,,,Monica,,
 I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.,,,,Monica,,
 If you're not going then I don't want to go either.,,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe you did that.,,,,Monica,,
" Mom, I'm hungry.",,,,Monica,,
 Alright.,,,,Monica,,
" Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?",,,,Monica,,
 [walks up to Rachel in front of the TV] Tonight?,,,,Monica,,
 What's tonight?,,,,Monica,,
" Uh, hello.",,,,Monica,,
" Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?",,,,Monica,,
 Yes but my mom got me this job.,,,,Monica,,
" Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.",,,,Monica,,
 Sorry we're late.,,,,Monica,,
" Dr. Burke, it, it's me.",,,,Monica,,
 Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.,,,,Monica,,
" I've been great, just great. How have you been? [tilting her head]",,,,Monica,,
 The head tilt?,,,,Monica,,
 I'm sorry.,,,,Monica,,
" [her and Phoebe tilt their heads] Oh, that's too bad.",,,,Monica,,
" You've got to get back out there, it's your party.",,,,Monica,,
 You're an opthamologist.,,,,Monica,,
" Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.",,,,Monica,,
 I am not.,,,,Monica,,
" Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.",,,,Monica,,
" Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.",,,,Monica,,
" Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.",,,,Monica,,
 Really.,,,,Monica,,
" Good, they feel good, in my head.",,,,Monica,,
 You too.,,,,Monica,,
" OK, um. Goodbye.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.",,,,Monica,,
 Thanks again.,,,,Monica,,
 Stop sending food to our apartment.,,,,Monica,,
 No one.,,,,Monica,,
 Nothing.,,,,Monica,,
" Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.",,,,Monica,,
 It's Richard Burke.,,,,Monica,,
" Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.",,,,Monica,,
 When?,,,,Monica,,
" Wow, is that Michelle?",,,,Monica,,
" I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.",,,,Monica,,
 I thought she just had one.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you're a grandpa.",,,,Monica,,
" I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 So maybe we should just. . .,,,,Monica,,
" Wow, this really sucks.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.",,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.,,,,Monica,,
" Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.",,,,Monica,,
" No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.",,,,Monica,,
" OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.",,,,Monica,,
 Happy birthday dad.,,,,Monica,,
" Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.",,,,Monica,,
 Are we still on that?,,,,Monica,,
 I'm a twinkie.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, this is so hard.",,,,Monica,,
 Maybe we should just tell your parents first.,,,,Monica,,
" God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.",,,,Monica,,
 Alright.,,,,Monica,,
 You remember that video I found of mom and dad?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, I just caught the live show.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey there.,,,,Monica,,
" Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, uh, he's a doctor.",,,,Monica,,
" No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him. [she puts her arm around Richard]",,,,Monica,,
" Mom, it's OK.",,,,Monica,,
" Dad, I'm the twinkie.",,,,Monica,,
" Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .",,,,Monica,,
" Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.",,,,Monica,,
 Yes.,,,,Monica,,
" Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.",,,,Monica,,
 Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.,,,,Monica,,
" So, are you sorry that I told them?",,,,Monica,,
 Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.,,,,Monica,,
 No he went out to get pizza.,,,,Monica,,
 That's great.,,,,Monica,,
 Yes.,,,,Monica,,
" I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.",,,,Monica,,
" [looking at some kind of glass sculpture thing] Wow Joey, this is, uhh...",,,,Monica,,
 Art it is.,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, promise me something.",,,,Monica,,
 Never call me from that phone.,,,,Monica,,
" Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.",,,,Monica,,
" Blow drying what, you have no hair.",,,,Monica,,
" Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .",,,,Monica,,
 GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!,,,,Monica,,
 I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.,,,,Monica,,
 Shut up.,,,,Monica,,
 Cut it out.,,,,Monica,,
 But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.,,,,Monica,,
" I promise you, he would definitely want you back.",,,,Monica,,
 I was.,,,,Monica,,
 Did she leave a number?,,,,Monica,,
" I don't have her number, butt-munch.",,,,Monica,,
" I'm not a baby, you're the baby.",,,,Monica,,
 You wanna get out of my face?,,,,Monica,,
 Give me that.,,,,Monica,,
" Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom. [she starts throwing oranges at Ross who's looking pleased with himself]",,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?,,,,Monica,,
 I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.,,,,Monica,,
 It's my TV.,,,,Monica,,
 Bite me.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.",,,,Monica,,
" OK, what're we gonna do about this?",,,,Monica,,
" Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.",,,,Monica,,
 I just can't stand you being here all the time.,,,,Monica,,
" Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?",,,,Monica,,
" Ross, I hated you when we were kids.",,,,Monica,,
" Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.",,,,Monica,,
" Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.",,,,Monica,,
 Duh-huh!,,,,Monica,,
 Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.,,,,Monica,,
 Then I won't have to kill you.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, thanks. You know what?",,,,Monica,,
" If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.",,,,Monica,,
 So what're you gonna do?,,,,Monica,,
 Sure.,,,,Monica,,
 [sings] They won't take you to the vet.,,,,Monica,,
 Joey.,,,,Monica,,
" We, we just wanna see the end.",,,,Monica,,
" Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, maybe you don't need them.",,,,Monica,,
" Shut up, I'm happy.",,,,Monica,,
" Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.",,,,Monica,,
" Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.",,,,Monica,,
" Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.",,,,Monica,,
" Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?",,,,Monica,,
" Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth. [goes in the bathroom]",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.",,,,Monica,,
 Well yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 You really ok with it?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, yay. Ok about that two.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, it just seems like a really small number.",,,,Monica,,
" And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?",,,,Monica,,
 But you've only slept with two people.,,,,Monica,,
" Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.",,,,Monica,,
 Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.,,,,Monica,,
 I know. I just can't find...,,,,Monica,,
 You need one too?,,,,Monica,,
 There's only one.,,,,Monica,,
" Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something. [shuts the bathroom door]",,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
" Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
" Fine, go have s*x.",,,,Monica,,
" It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.",,,,Monica,,
 Why?,,,,Monica,,
" Wait, he's not here yet.",,,,Monica,,
 Alright.,,,,Monica,,
 Did they just kill off Joey?,,,,Monica,,
 And some of us really have to pee.,,,,Monica,,
 Sorry Joey [runs to the bathroom],,,,Monica,,
" Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
 A mirror?,,,,Monica,,
" Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.",,,,Monica,,
 Cache? Jaunty?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, it was incredible.",,,,Monica,,
 Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.,,,,Monica,,
" It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.",,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 Yes. But all the other ones.,,,,Monica,,
 Isn't it.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
 You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?,,,,Monica,,
 Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!,,,,Monica,,
 I wa-,,,,Monica,,
 And I would have to say pah-huh.,,,,Monica,,
 Do you not remember the puppet guy?,,,,Monica,,
 And his puppet too.,,,,Monica,,
 Who?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh.,,,,Monica,,
" Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.",,,,Monica,,
" Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.",,,,Monica,,
 One hour? You are such a leaf blower.,,,,Monica,,
 We didn't order cake.,,,,Monica,,
 You're right.,,,,Monica,,
 We're good.,,,,Monica,,
 Are you sure this time?,,,,Monica,,
 There is no alley behind Macy's.,,,,Monica,,
" So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?",,,,Monica,,
 Nice.,,,,Monica,,
 What about the part where he has rabies?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.",,,,Monica,,
" Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.",,,,Monica,,
" Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.",,,,Monica,,
" Ok. [Richard walks in] Hey, why don't you ask Richard?",,,,Monica,,
" I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?",,,,Monica,,
 C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.,,,,Monica,,
" So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag. [walks off]",,,,Monica,,
" Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?",,,,Monica,,
 So'd you guys have fun?,,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?",,,,Monica,,
 Ross.,,,,Monica,,
" Look. [they look at Joey in the kitchen with a cigar in his mouth, looking at his reflection in a spatula] Joey, do you know we can see you from here?",,,,Monica,,
" You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.",,,,Monica,,
" So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?",,,,Monica,,
 You're meeting Richard?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.",,,,Monica,,
 With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?,,,,Monica,,
 So you watched the movies huh?,,,,Monica,,
" Alright, you wanna feel better?",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, here, watch this.",,,,Monica,,
" So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.",,,,Monica,,
 There's a game?,,,,Monica,,
" Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.",,,,Monica,,
" Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, then go Vassar.",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, then just go.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.",,,,Monica,,
" It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?",,,,Monica,,
 I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.,,,,Monica,,
" Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.",,,,Monica,,
 Did you like it?,,,,Monica,,
" Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?",,,,Monica,,
" [enters] Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.",,,,Monica,,
 [grabs the other two bars on Richard's side and scores] Score! Now can we go?,,,,Monica,,
 Um-hmm.,,,,Monica,,
 Nighty-nite.,,,,Monica,,
 [her and Richard return to her place] So are you ok?,,,,Monica,,
" Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, well they suck too.",,,,Monica,,
" 'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.",,,,Monica,,
 Really.,,,,Monica,,
 His indian name?,,,,Monica,,
 Wow.,,,,Monica,,
" Weird, weird.",,,,Monica,,
 Why?,,,,Monica,,
 It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?,,,,Monica,,
 How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.,,,,Monica,,
 I don't want a beer.,,,,Monica,,
" [seeing TV] Hey, I went up.",,,,Monica,,
" My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.",,,,Monica,,
 Put all my money in me.,,,,Monica,,
" What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls...[on the phone] Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.",,,,Monica,,
 I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.",,,,Monica,,
" MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.",,,,Monica,,
 DON'T...be too long with the phone.,,,,Monica,,
 [Opens the door] I need to borrow a hundred bucks.,,,,Monica,,
" Hi, welcome home. [pulls Rachel inside] I need to borrow a hundred bucks.",,,,Monica,,
 I've gotta get back in the game.,,,,Monica,,
" I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?",,,,Monica,,
" But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.",,,,Monica,,
" So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 You wanna be in charge of the food committee?,,,,Monica,,
" Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.",,,,Monica,,
" Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See [squeezes her breast] honk honk.",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.",,,,Monica,,
 Joey that is horriable.,,,,Monica,,
 So what happened?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, how bout just her mom?",,,,Monica,,
 Cause I already invited her.,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.",,,,Monica,,
 It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.,,,,Monica,,
 [answers the door] Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?,,,,Monica,,
" No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.",,,,Monica,,
" No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.",,,,Monica,,
 Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.,,,,Monica,,
" Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.",,,,Monica,,
" So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.",,,,Monica,,
 Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.,,,,Monica,,
 Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? [buzzer goes off] Alright that's Ross.,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.",,,,Monica,,
" Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.",,,,Monica,,
 Just go.,,,,Monica,,
" Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.",,,,Monica,,
" Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. [she demonstrates, Gunther starts to walk to the door] Gunther, where're you going?",,,,Monica,,
" No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.",,,,Monica,,
" What? [she runs over to where Phoebe is, Phoebe signals for Gunther to go] I don't see anything.",,,,Monica,,
" Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.",,,,Monica,,
" You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?",,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe.,,,,Monica,,
" Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance... [volleyball hits her in the head from behind]",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.",,,,Monica,,
 Ok will do. So glad you came.,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.",,,,Monica,,
 Thank you.,,,,Monica,,
" Ok everybody, it's time for flan.",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, that's enough.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I ordered mine first.",,,,Monica,,
 Give it to me.,,,,Monica,,
 Give it to me.,,,,Monica,,
" [She grabs the coffee cup on the table and licks the rim.] There you go, enjoy your coffee.",,,,Monica,,
" [Chandler tries to come back with a smart-ass remark but can't swallow the muffin.] Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.",,,,Monica,,
 That'll teach you to lick my muffin.,,,,Monica,,
 Had it.,,,,Monica,,
" Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.",,,,Monica,,
 Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.,,,,Monica,,
 Just waiting for you sweetie.,,,,Monica,,
" I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.",,,,Monica,,
" If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.",,,,Monica,,
 I'm just easing you in.,,,,Monica,,
" Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.",,,,Monica,,
" Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.",,,,Monica,,
" You look fabulous honey, you really do.",,,,Monica,,
 It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.,,,,Monica,,
 This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.,,,,Monica,,
 It's for their own good.,,,,Monica,,
" Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?",,,,Monica,,
 Very good.,,,,Monica,,
 You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.,,,,Monica,,
 I'm gonna set them to my time.,,,,Monica,,
" No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?",,,,Monica,,
" No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.",,,,Monica,,
 No. See you don't understand.,,,,Monica,,
 No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh yeah.,,,,Monica,,
" Alright, well tell me one of yours.",,,,Monica,,
 What if they get mixed up?,,,,Monica,,
" You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.",,,,Monica,,
 What's up?,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah?,,,,Monica,,
 No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.,,,,Monica,,
" No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.",,,,Monica,,
" Alright, go on.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, you're a freak.",,,,Monica,,
 Then what's the problem?,,,,Monica,,
" What, forget it!",,,,Monica,,
" Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him. (Rachel glares at her, and she retreats to safety between Richard's legs)",,,,Monica,,
" Woo-hoo, stuud!",,,,Monica,,
" Woo-hoo, geeek!",,,,Monica,,
 Please!,,,,Monica,,
" Bye sweetie, (kisses him) I love you.",,,,Monica,,
 What are you talking about? What wedding?,,,,Monica,,
" Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'",,,,Monica,,
 Could not be more terrified.,,,,Monica,,
" (holding up a blanket) Where's Benny? (drops the blanket) There he is! (does it again) Where's Benny, there he is.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure. ",,,,Monica,,
" Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, am I in it?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.",,,,Monica,,
 Keep talkin'.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?",,,,Monica,,
" Not a basset, a bassinet.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.",,,,Monica,,
 Uh-huh.,,,,Monica,,
" That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.",,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.,,,,Monica,,
" So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.",,,,Monica,,
" You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I...(sees two little girls dancing together) I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.",,,,Monica,,
 You'll do what?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.",,,,Monica,,
 I know you do. Me too. (pause) So what now?,,,,Monica,,
" God, look what I found in the drain.",,,,Monica,,
 It's some of Richard's hair! (holds it close to Ross) What do I do with this?,,,,Monica,,
" It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)",,,,Monica,,
" God, what is wrong with me.",,,,Monica,,
 I need to get some Richard.,,,,Monica,,
" I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!",,,,Monica,,
 What are you the memory woman?,,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, they-they sent me home.",,,,Monica,,
 Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.,,,,Monica,,
 I know I do.,,,,Monica,,
" Richard's living room, drinking wine.",,,,Monica,,
" I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, I'll try not to.",,,,Monica,,
 Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?,,,,Monica,,
" I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.",,,,Monica,,
" (crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.",,,,Monica,,
" Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe leave)",,,,Monica,,
" Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?",,,,Monica,,
" I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?",,,,Monica,,
 What makes you think that I might not be okay?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh.,,,,Monica,,
" I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?",,,,Monica,,
" No, I really, really do.",,,,Monica,,
 Really!,,,,Monica,,
 You're not just saying that are you?,,,,Monica,,
 Was he crying?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?",,,,Monica,,
 I think so.,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hi.,,,,Monica,,
" Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!",,,,Monica,,
" (to Ross) Ooh, are you gonna do magic?",,,,Monica,,
 Hang on a second I just got in.,,,,Monica,,
 Has somebody been drinking my fat? (Joey and Chandler look at each other),,,,Monica,,
" Rach, did you check the machine?",,,,Monica,,
 Is-is-is that message old or new? (yelling) Old or new?! Old or new?!,,,,Monica,,
" What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?",,,,Monica,,
 Huh?,,,,Monica,,
" If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?",,,,Monica,,
" So, should I call him back?",,,,Monica,,
 I called him.,,,,Monica,,
" Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?",,,,Monica,,
" Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.",,,,Monica,,
 I know the code to his answering machine.,,,,Monica,,
" (on machine) ""Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy.""",,,,Monica,,
 He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, who's voice was that?",,,,Monica,,
" Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?",,,,Monica,,
 It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.,,,,Monica,,
" (entering from her room) Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. That was her right?,,,,Monica,,
" See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.",,,,Monica,,
" (on phone) Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. (listens) Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....",,,,Monica,,
" (on phone) Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! (Michelle hangs up) That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, fine. (runs to her room)",,,,Monica,,
 Not any more!,,,,Monica,,
" Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.",,,,Monica,,
" Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!",,,,Monica,,
" (on machine) ""Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know."" Nooo!!",,,,Monica,,
 I don't know!,,,,Monica,,
 Noooo!!!!,,,,Monica,,
 Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.",,,,Monica,,
 Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.,,,,Monica,,
" I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. (sees Joey trying some jam from the pot) Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. (Joey realizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)",,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hey guys.,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) It's blackberry curin.",,,,Monica,,
" Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.",,,,Monica,,
" I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.",,,,Monica,,
 I'm talking about me having a baby.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.",,,,Monica,,
" It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.",,,,Monica,,
" I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.",,,,Monica,,
" (entering from her bedroom) Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2"", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.",,,,Monica,,
 You're gonna what?,,,,Monica,,
 What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....,,,,Monica,,
" Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. (they all turn and look at Joey) Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'",,,,Monica,,
" Joey, this is you!",,,,Monica,,
" Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.",,,,Monica,,
" I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
 To the bank.,,,,Monica,,
 Sperm.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.",,,,Monica,,
" 'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Really? Why?,,,,Monica,,
 Hoyt?,,,,Monica,,
" Really, is he a swimmer?",,,,Monica,,
 I like that. (Joey starts laughing) What?,,,,Monica,,
 We do not have one of those signs.,,,,Monica,,
 Two girls and a boy?,,,,Monica,,
" And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
" Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways",,,,Monica,,
" See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, now you want a pad.",,,,Monica,,
 (entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody,,,,Monica,,
" There it is. Joey, what are you doing?",,,,Monica,,
" What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant",,,,Monica,,
 That is never good.,,,,Monica,,
 Welcome to our side of the tunnel.,,,,Monica,,
" You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you",,,,Monica,,
" Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just",,,,Monica,,
 She has to know that your not ready.,,,,Monica,,
" My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.",,,,Monica,,
" You know what, everything's gonna be okay. ",,,,Monica,,
 If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you",,,,Monica,,
" Aw, it's soo unfair. (they both start digging into the 'good'",,,,Monica,,
" What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big",,,,Monica,,
" Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.",,,,Monica,,
" The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.",,,,Monica,,
 How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea. ,,,,Monica,,
 Wasn't there a little song?,,,,Monica,,
 (singing) 'I am Bea.',,,,Monica,,
 'I drink tea.',,,,Monica,,
" '....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '",,,,Monica,,
" A-ha!!! (they all start laughing, as Ross hides in the",,,,Monica,,
" No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.",,,,Monica,,
" So, Chandler, who’s on your list?",,,,Monica,,
" First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey! Where ‘ya headin’ in those pants? 1982?,,,,Monica,,
" Why, what’s wrong with my bathroom floor?",,,,Monica,,
 I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom),,,,Monica,,
 I can’t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?,,,,Monica,,
 That’s a little more than I wanted to see.,,,,Monica,,
 I can’t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.,,,,Monica,,
" You know that’s nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!",,,,Monica,,
 What kind of karate is that?,,,,Monica,,
 So how’s it going with you guys?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh honey, we’re close now but you-you wouldn’t believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and....(Phoebe shakes her head like she doesn’t understand) That’s where the waistband actually goes over your head.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, how do you play the shadow game?",,,,Monica,,
 I just asked you.,,,,Monica,,
" No, that is what the game is.",,,,Monica,,
 What’s the matter?,,,,Monica,,
 He’s retiling my floor. (they both run to the bathroom),,,,Monica,,
" Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.",,,,Monica,,
 It’s beautiful! It’s like the first bathroom floor there ever was. (Chandler tries to go to the bathroom) Whoa! Are you going in there for?,,,,Monica,,
 And who laminated it?,,,,Monica,,
 Are you serious? (they all look) Oh my God.,,,,Monica,,
 Why? ‘Cause otherwise you’d go for it?,,,,Monica,,
" Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?",,,,Monica,,
" (entering from bedroom) Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, then it must’ve been you. Bye. (leaves)",,,,Monica,,
" (entering) Ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on the floor or come over no more!",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.,,,,Monica,,
 Chris says they’re closing down the bar.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, apparently they’re turning it into some kinda coffee place.",,,,Monica,,
 Got me.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, did you pick a roommate?",,,,Monica,,
 Is it the Italian guy?,,,,Monica,,
 He’s so cute.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh look, the pool table’s free. Rack ‘em up. I’ll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, I went to high school with her. (to Rachel) Rachel! Hi!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, you can’t even see where the Titanic hit it.",,,,Monica,,
" Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations",,,,Monica,,
" Aww, not right now.",,,,Monica,,
 I know.,,,,Monica,,
" So, I’ll get-get back to my friend.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, that’d be great.",,,,Monica,,
 Thanks.,,,,Monica,,
" Bye! (to Chandler) Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.",,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing with the lamp?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, well don’t take it to the same place you took the stereo, ‘cause they’ve had that thing for over a week.",,,,Monica,,
" Hi, again.",,,,Monica,,
" Thank you soo, much.",,,,Monica,,
 You want some help with that?,,,,Monica,,
 Whoa! Are you okay?,,,,Monica,,
" It’s the heat. (has her hand on his chest, and then pulls it away) And-and the humidity.",,,,Monica,,
 Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.,,,,Monica,,
" This place is really my Grandmother’s. (Joey starts to take off all of his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?",,,,Monica,,
" (turning around) Okay, here’s your pen1s!",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!,,,,Monica,,
 So?!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!,,,,Monica,,
" I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have s*x?",,,,Monica,,
" It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.",,,,Monica,,
 Pheebs?,,,,Monica,,
 Where’s your bed?,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 What are you talking about?,,,,Monica,,
 Everybody knows!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.",,,,Monica,,
 What?!?!,,,,Monica,,
 You can spill. In the sink.,,,,Monica,,
" I love you, too.",,,,Monica,,
 What? I’m just said.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
 (all depressed) Help yourself.,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe moved out.,,,,Monica,,
" I don’t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don’t have a boyfriend?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I think so.",,,,Monica,,
" I know, it is isn’t it?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.",,,,Monica,,
 I know. Thanks. (Chandler leaves),,,,Monica,,
" Hey, are you okay?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?",,,,Monica,,
 I was always Joanne.,,,,Monica,,
" I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) And I’m appalled for you by the way.",,,,Monica,,
 What’s the part?,,,,Monica,,
 Not at these prices.,,,,Monica,,
" (lying down on a mattress) Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.",,,,Monica,,
 (sees the bed) What’s this?,,,,Monica,,
 This is not the bed I ordered!,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe!,,,,Monica,,
 Why is this car in my bedroom?,,,,Monica,,
 When did I sign for it?,,,,Monica,,
 Did you make brownies today?,,,,Monica,,
" (to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed.",,,,Monica,,
" Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offers her, her hand to comfort her.)",,,,Monica,,
" Joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.",,,,Monica,,
" You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.",,,,Monica,,
" So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?",,,,Monica,,
" Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you",,,,Monica,,
" (to Ben) Who’s so brave, you’re so brave, yes you are,",,,,Monica,,
" He’s not gonna say anything, because we’re not gonna tell",,,,Monica,,
 No we’re not.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, we’re gonna need a distraction.",,,,Monica,,
 I got it!,,,,Monica,,
" The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take",,,,Monica,,
 A hat! Yes! We need a hat.,,,,Monica,,
 Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?,,,,Monica,,
 Because he’ll know what to do? (Rachel comes out of her,,,,Monica,,
 Give it. Give it.,,,,Monica,,
 It just makes more sense as an ensemble.,,,,Monica,,
" Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.",,,,Monica,,
" Sure, we have no money, go ahead.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?,,,,Monica,,
 Did he just say ‘Monica bang’?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! He’s gonna rat me out!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that,",,,,Monica,,
 You okay?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, Ben, I won’t tell your daddy that you had ice cream",,,,Monica,,
" Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I exploded.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, we should call somebody.",,,,Monica,,
 How are we gonna do that? There’s no way.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 No. Why?,,,,Monica,,
 Really?!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)",,,,Monica,,
 (coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how,,,,Monica,,
" And yet, we’re still poking him.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.",,,,Monica,,
 Every year.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the ‘Geller Bowl.’",,,,Monica,,
" Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind’ve competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross’s nose.",,,,Monica,,
" To score the winning touchdown, by the way.",,,,Monica,,
 (to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.,,,,Monica,,
" Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it’s been twelve years.",,,,Monica,,
 (shouting) Once!!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. Let’s bring it in.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, why don’t we just bunny up.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.",,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe.,,,,Monica,,
" All right people listen, I’ve got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.",,,,Monica,,
 Huddle up.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, Phoebe you know what you’re doing right?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, Joey’s gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you’re doing?",,,,Monica,,
 Break.,,,,Monica,,
 Score!! 7 to nothing!,,,,Monica,,
 Losers walk!,,,,Monica,,
" Come on guys! Let’s go! Come on, it’s second down.",,,,Monica,,
" No it’s not, it’s second.",,,,Monica,,
" Wow, what?",,,,Monica,,
 Pulling what? It’s second down.,,,,Monica,,
 I heard that!,,,,Monica,,
" All right, come on guys, let’s go! Tie score, and we’re runnin’ out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! (the timer sounds as Monica throws the ball to Phoebe.)",,,,Monica,,
" Run, Phoebe, run!",,,,Monica,,
 After the snap!,,,,Monica,,
 Does so count!,,,,Monica,,
" Y'know what, that’s fine, maybe you haven’t grown up, but I have.",,,,Monica,,
 Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.),,,,Monica,,
" No! Listen, I’m not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can’t blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let’s just call this, tie score and it’s halftime.",,,,Monica,,
 Y'know what? I’ll think you’ll play.,,,,Monica,,
 Because the winner gets this!,,,,Monica,,
" When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.",,,,Monica,,
" No it’s not! You want it, you’re gonna have to win it!",,,,Monica,,
" Come on Phoebe, let’s go! Come on, it’s time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.",,,,Monica,,
" All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?",,,,Monica,,
" All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I’ll take care of the rest.",,,,Monica,,
 Break!,,,,Monica,,
" Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don’t see that everyday, do ya?",,,,Monica,,
 What?! I just touched him and he went over.,,,,Monica,,
" Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!",,,,Monica,,
" You’re so pathetic! Why can’t you just accept it, we’re winning because I’m better than you.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I’ll prove it to you, okay. I’ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I’ll still win the game.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.",,,,Monica,,
" Come on Rach, come on. Let’s see what’s it like to be on a winning team for a change.",,,,Monica,,
 All right then.,,,,Monica,,
 Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.,,,,Monica,,
" We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you’re making out...",,,,Monica,,
" Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let’s kill ‘um!",,,,Monica,,
" All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we’re down by two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a slow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, there’s a reason.",,,,Monica,,
" All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I’ll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.",,,,Monica,,
 Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!,,,,Monica,,
 No! I’m not okay!,,,,Monica,,
 Come on! Come on! Hurry! We’re running out of time! Huddle up!,,,,Monica,,
" All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.",,,,Monica,,
 Break!,,,,Monica,,
 Let go! I’m a tiny little woman!!,,,,Monica,,
 Ow!!,,,,Monica,,
 Let go!,,,,Monica,,
 No!,,,,Monica,,
 I don’t know. I guess the other people just don’t care enough.,,,,Monica,,
 Let go!,,,,Monica,,
 You broke a little girl’s leg?!!,,,,Monica,,
" Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...",,,,Monica,,
" All right, I’ll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that’s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross) Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?",,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
" Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t do this.",,,,Monica,,
 (she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out),,,,Monica,,
" (comes up and starts looking through Ross’s cookie supply) Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it’s no big deal, all right, I’m-I’m cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!",,,,Monica,,
 (covers her neck) Oh God! (runs to the bathroom),,,,Monica,,
 Christmas cookie?,,,,Monica,,
" (entering) Hey, guys. I’m here to pick out my Christmas tree.",,,,Monica,,
 Is this the one that I threw out last year?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh honey, is that ‘cause your Mom died around Christmas?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh. (turns and looks at Joey, who gives a ‘way-to-go’ thumbs up and smile.)",,,,Monica,,
 Um-mm.,,,,Monica,,
" Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?",,,,Monica,,
" He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.",,,,Monica,,
" I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, be my guest.",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, what’s the matter?",,,,Monica,,
 It’s Joey’s birthday.,,,,Monica,,
 Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.,,,,Monica,,
" I know honey, I’m sorry.",,,,Monica,,
" (gives her a look) Gee, I don’t know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey Gunther. Hi. (to Phoebe) I mean you’re going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?,,,,Monica,,
" I know, he’s too charming, but if you two start going out, then it’s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.",,,,Monica,,
" Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?",,,,Monica,,
 (to Chandler) Stick out your tongue.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my!!,,,,Monica,,
" How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey’s sisters.",,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 Isn’t that great?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, ‘Hummina-hummina-hummina.’ (walks away)",,,,Monica,,
 How ya feelin’?,,,,Monica,,
 What is the worse part?,,,,Monica,,
" Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he’s actually going to kill you dead.",,,,Monica,,
" I mean, was it Gina?",,,,Monica,,
" No, no, no, that’s Dina.",,,,Monica,,
 That was me.,,,,Monica,,
 That’s okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Y'know which one was she again?,,,,Monica,,
" No honey, I’m sorry, but the weekend’s not over yet.",,,,Monica,,
 I guess they’re back from their date.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
 I am good. I finished my book.,,,,Monica,,
 I don’t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?,,,,Monica,,
" Wait a minute, why don’t you just call Mark. (they both look up in shock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you’ve got to make stuff happen.",,,,Monica,,
" (to Ross) Honey, it’s not pushy, he gave her his home number.",,,,Monica,,
 Yay!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, that is amazing!",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Are you crazy?!,,,,Monica,,
" What?! Ross y'know this isn’t even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you’re right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?",,,,Monica,,
 I mean don’t you trust her?,,,,Monica,,
 Then get over yourself! Grow up!,,,,Monica,,
" So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I do know.",,,,Monica,,
" Y'know if it’s any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you. (Rachel nods in agreement)",,,,Monica,,
" Please, I'm not going for anything.",,,,Monica,,
 Would you please go?,,,,Monica,,
" Look Julio, someone left their book here.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh yeah, what are you reading?",,,,Monica,,
" Have I read it? (pause) No, are you enjoying it?",,,,Monica,,
 Your a poet and don't know it. (she turns away and makes a face like 'I can't believe I just said that.'),,,,Monica,,
" Oh, then you do know it. (pause) So um what kind of things do you write about?",,,,Monica,,
 Mine? (points to her lower lip) Right here?,,,,Monica,,
" How would that go? (they kiss) Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.",,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hi!,,,,Monica,,
" It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.",,,,Monica,,
" Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out. (hands them the poem)",,,,Monica,,
" Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work. (tries to take the poem)",,,,Monica,,
" All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, just like the one in the poem.",,,,Monica,,
 What do you mean?,,,,Monica,,
" (to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?",,,,Monica,,
" Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.",,,,Monica,,
 You don't even know me...,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...",,,,Monica,,
 (sarcastically) Oh yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 (to clerk) Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 Six? I just had it for one night. It’s three.,,,,Monica,,
" Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you’re gonna have to help me out here, ‘cause I only have three.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God. Richard? (turns around) Hi!,,,,Monica,,
" Wow! Your lip went bald. (Richard pays the clerk) Hey, thanks.",,,,Monica,,
 Right.,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" (removes them) That’s because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it’s static cling. Or maybe it’s just that God knew I’d be running into you and saw an opportunity.",,,,Monica,,
 It’s good to see you too.,,,,Monica,,
" You see that guy? He’s in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he’s going straight to the p0rn.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 Me too.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, um, I don’t know if that’s a good idea.",,,,Monica,,
" No, I just I think that it’s too soon.",,,,Monica,,
 (entering from her bedroom) Morning.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah well, I ran into Richard.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.",,,,Monica,,
 Tomorrow night.,,,,Monica,,
" It’s not a date, okay. I’m just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.",,,,Monica,,
" We’re not gonna have s*x! Okay, nothing’s changed here. He still doesn’t want children and I still do, so that’s why we’re just gonna be friends.",,,,Monica,,
" You say ‘Thank you very much,’ and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we’re gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we’re gonna start squishing the tomatoes.",,,,Monica,,
 You touch people’s eyeballs every day and this feels weird.,,,,Monica,,
 Oops.,,,,Monica,,
 Gotta keep squishing.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.",,,,Monica,,
" Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it (does so) and it should umm, be.....",,,,Monica,,
" Umm, you’ve got some on your pants.",,,,Monica,,
" So, how’d the lasagne go over? (listens) Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. (listens) Yeah, I’ve been thinking a lot about you too. (listens) I know. It’s hard this whole platonic thing. (listens) It’s a word!",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I do think it’s better this way. (listens) Yeah, we’re being smart. (gets up to answer the door) (listens) Yes, I’m sure.(she opens the door and it’s Richard)",,,,Monica,,
 I’ll call you back. (starts kissing him),,,,Monica,,
 So we can be friends who sleep together.,,,,Monica,,
" Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?",,,,Monica,,
 Oh.,,,,Monica,,
 No! (pushes him) No!,,,,Monica,,
" ‘Cause if you do that means you’d be cancelling it for me, and we’re just friends.",,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
" You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over her left breast.) in a grill fire.",,,,Monica,,
 What are you smiling at?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, right.",,,,Monica,,
 I love this friend thing!,,,,Monica,,
 Ow!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom as Richard starts the tour.),,,,Monica,,
" (still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?",,,,Monica,,
" (still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And I’m just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.",,,,Monica,,
" (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I’m not fine, I’m not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause) Y'know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?",,,,Monica,,
" Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.",,,,Monica,,
" That’s not true, you don’t have a moustache.",,,,Monica,,
" Y'know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don’t think I could do it again.",,,,Monica,,
 How ‘bout one last game of racquetball?,,,,Monica,,
 Watch the thorns!,,,,Monica,,
 (to Phoebe) Look at you. All jealous.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, sure.",,,,Monica,,
 Y'know those are a delicacy in India.,,,,Monica,,
" Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.",,,,Monica,,
" No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, Ginger something.",,,,Monica,,
" No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, (singing) ‘the movie star.’",,,,Monica,,
" Well, what did you do?",,,,Monica,,
" Y'know what, don’t tell us. We’ll just wait until Chandler gets home, (to Phoebe) because it’ll be more fun that way.",,,,Monica,,
 You gave her food poisoning!?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?",,,,Monica,,
 Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe why don’t you just call her? You obviously want to.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, don’t ‘cha wanna?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, well I do know you.",,,,Monica,,
 Well so?,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hi!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, can I borrow this? (points to his milk) My milk’s gone bad.",,,,Monica,,
" So umm, how was your date with Ginger?",,,,Monica,,
" Sounds like she’s got the ah, whole package.",,,,Monica,,
 Uh-huh.,,,,Monica,,
" Sorry, Pheebs.",,,,Monica,,
 We’d love too.,,,,Monica,,
 Wow! It’s like Rachel in High School.,,,,Monica,,
" Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!",,,,Monica,,
" I won’t give you anything, but you’ll owe me 2.95.",,,,Monica,,
 Why? (in a motherlike tone) Do you have a report due?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, let’s start with the free messages outside the UN.",,,,Monica,,
 Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?,,,,Monica,,
 Where’s that?,,,,Monica,,
 I don’t have an atlas.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, but wait I do have a globe.",,,,Monica,,
 Hold on.,,,,Monica,,
" ‘Kay, here you go. (Hands her this tiny little globe.)",,,,Monica,,
" It’s a globe and, a pencil sharpener.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, no thanks.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?",,,,Monica,,
 Wow! It’s small.,,,,Monica,,
" So you had fun, huh?",,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh no, she’s still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.",,,,Monica,,
" All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. (holds up a notepad) Call Rachel.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh that’s my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. (to Phoebe) She’s fancy.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? (Mischa laughs) Why? What did I say?",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.,,,,Monica,,
 I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, I was having a conversation.",,,,Monica,,
 What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh. (to Phoebe) Can I have a tissue?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, the man’s dog just died.",,,,Monica,,
 It will be my pleasure. (to Phoebe) My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can’t even say coupons. (they leave),,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
 How’s the big anniversary dinner?,,,,Monica,,
" Ohhh, nice.",,,,Monica,,
 What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and fruit flies everywhere.),,,,Monica,,
" That’s okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) on my ceiling! You broke up?!",,,,Monica,,
 Oh no!!,,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, you and Mark?!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, there’s banana on it.",,,,Monica,,
 So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head),,,,Monica,,
" Oh, good. Thanks.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....",,,,Monica,,
 Yes! Have you seen it?,,,,Monica,,
 I know!!,,,,Monica,,
 Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!,,,,Monica,,
 Did that!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!,,,,Monica,,
" No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.",,,,Monica,,
" That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.",,,,Monica,,
" Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?",,,,Monica,,
 Ow!,,,,Monica,,
 Ow!! Ow!!,,,,Monica,,
" It’s okay, it’s okay.",,,,Monica,,
 We were just waxing our legs.,,,,Monica,,
 That’s right.,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 (going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us?!,,,,Monica,,
" (stopping him) What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there.",,,,Monica,,
 Because they’ll know we’ve been listening.,,,,Monica,,
 What if they don’t?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.,,,,Monica,,
 Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?,,,,Monica,,
 No! Rachel is meeting us here.,,,,Monica,,
 It’s never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.,,,,Monica,,
" (seeing her) Okay, let’s go!! Let’s hit the road!!",,,,Monica,,
 Let’s get the show on it!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.",,,,Monica,,
 We’re sorry honey.,,,,Monica,,
 Very bad.,,,,Monica,,
 Chandler!!,,,,Monica,,
 Weren’t you nine?!,,,,Monica,,
" We’re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.",,,,Monica,,
 Noo! I’ll stay. He’s my brother.,,,,Monica,,
 No! We’re gonna have fun. We can make fudge!,,,,Monica,,
 Why? Do you think he’s still mad at us?,,,,Monica,,
 No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Ow!,,,,Monica,,
" (getting out) No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.",,,,Monica,,
" So, if you’re parents hadn’t got divorced, you’d be able to answer a question like a normal person?",,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 Please!!,,,,Monica,,
" These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it’s gotta be Rachel.",,,,Monica,,
" All right then, your bra would still be big.",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler!!,,,,Monica,,
" Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?",,,,Monica,,
" Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.",,,,Monica,,
 So the going for help went well?,,,,Monica,,
 Then why are you smoking?,,,,Monica,,
" (running over to stop Rachel) Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let’s stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)",,,,Monica,,
 (reading the sign) What’s ‘pleh’?,,,,Monica,,
 Huh. What’s doofus spelled backwards?,,,,Monica,,
" I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?",,,,Monica,,
" Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?",,,,Monica,,
 Here we go again.,,,,Monica,,
 (shyly) I don’t know.,,,,Monica,,
" What I said was, was that I understood. Joey’s the one who agreed with you!",,,,Monica,,
" All right, we’ll call you when we get back.",,,,Monica,,
 (to Joey) What’s so funny?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh. (she laughs),,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don’t you think he’s a little young to get married?",,,,Monica,,
" So, um, how-how did you guys meet?",,,,Monica,,
" And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I’ve only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.",,,,Monica,,
" (to a customer) Pete, can I get you something else?",,,,Monica,,
 Haven’t you and I covered that topic?,,,,Monica,,
" Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.",,,,Monica,,
" I mean really, think about it.",,,,Monica,,
" Nah, he doesn’t do anything for me.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids…. (realises) All right, I get your point.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" Uh, yeah.",,,,Monica,,
 Here you go.,,,,Monica,,
" As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I’d call him.",,,,Monica,,
 That’s Bill Clinton.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! That’s Pete! But why is Bill huggin’ Pete?,,,,Monica,,
 I’m not gonna go out with him.,,,,Monica,,
 Or incredibly offensive.,,,,Monica,,
 What the hell is this? (holding up the check),,,,Monica,,
" Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?",,,,Monica,,
" You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?",,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, umm, you’re a loon.",,,,Monica,,
 I don’t know.,,,,Monica,,
 ‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behaviour.,,,,Monica,,
" Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?",,,,Monica,,
 I know!!,,,,Monica,,
 (opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" And that’s why, I’m not inviting you in for a drink. (starts to leave) Bye.",,,,Monica,,
" (in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, that’s sounds great.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh come on, it’s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?",,,,Monica,,
" Why, how much is that?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, this is so great.",,,,Monica,,
" All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.",,,,Monica,,
" Hello, people who do not live here.",,,,Monica,,
 I gave you a key for emergencies!,,,,Monica,,
" He’s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He’s so funny, and sooo sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!!",,,,Monica,,
" Noo!! It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.",,,,Monica,,
 Two.,,,,Monica,,
" Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head and says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!",,,,Monica,,
 Sure.,,,,Monica,,
" (looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I’m gonna say, midget rodeo.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay. Umm, y'know, I don’t think, I don’t think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.",,,,Monica,,
" So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?",,,,Monica,,
 I so wanna be attracted to you.,,,,Monica,,
 I’m sorry.,,,,Monica,,
 It’s not?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, um, look I-I don’t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Rach, how was work?",,,,Monica,,
" By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.",,,,Monica,,
 Something wrong?,,,,Monica,,
" Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?",,,,Monica,,
" Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (to Ross) And I’m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?",,,,Monica,,
 I get the dollhouse!,,,,Monica,,
" Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.",,,,Monica,,
" Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.",,,,Monica,,
" Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper’s a little faded, that’s okay. Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!!",,,,Monica,,
 I know!!!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 What’s this?,,,,Monica,,
 Not one that can pee on the roof.,,,,Monica,,
 I don’t want a ghost.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go.",,,,Monica,,
" It’s very interesting, Phoebe.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!",,,,Monica,,
 You’re kidding?! That’s great!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my.,,,,Monica,,
" Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?",,,,Monica,,
" Hmm, bite me.",,,,Monica,,
 (from the bathroom) I’m in the shower!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.",,,,Monica,,
 (runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. There’s....been a fire.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.",,,,Monica,,
 That was you?!,,,,Monica,,
" Hi! Hey, Pete you’re back! Hey, check this out. (She starts to",,,,Monica,,
 Wow! You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, what’d ya bring me?! (She opens the gift) Awww, hotel",,,,Monica,,
 (popping back up) Regular or decaf?,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (hands him a cup),,,,Monica,,
 So what did you do today Pete?,,,,Monica,,
 What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls),,,,Monica,,
 Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?,,,,Monica,,
 I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy,,,,Monica,,
" Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, please. ",,,,Monica,,
 What? Honey.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh God, I’m so sorry.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh God!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel,,,,Monica,,
 What-what was it you were gonna tell us? ,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. Here’s the thing.,,,,Monica,,
" I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have",,,,Monica,,
 Huh?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m so happy for",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?,,,,Monica,,
 (rolling towards the office) I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, guess what I’m doing tonight.",,,,Monica,,
 I’m checking out the restaurant with Pete.,,,,Monica,,
 I know.,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?,,,,Monica,,
 Does it have to do with Joey?,,,,Monica,,
 Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he,,,,Monica,,
 Does it involve travel?,,,,Monica,,
 Does it involve clogs?,,,,Monica,,
 Clogs.,,,,Monica,,
 Claws?!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, so it doesn’t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey.",,,,Monica,,
 What is it?! What about Pete?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I feel like I’m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I gotta go. (gets up)",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete’s computer",,,,Monica,,
" I don’t believe this! Wow, look at this refridgerator! It’s",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. (runs over and hugs",,,,Monica,,
 Did you just smell my hair?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh God.,,,,Monica,,
 You still have feelings for me don’t you?,,,,Monica,,
 Pete.,,,,Monica,,
" No, it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’s really nice.",,,,Monica,,
" You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with",,,,Monica,,
" And well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, bye. ",,,,Monica,,
 All right shut up for a second and let me just see something.,,,,Monica,,
 I need two. I’m bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!,,,,Monica,,
 Really? Who’s number two?,,,,Monica,,
 Bye-bye!,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, what are you doing?! It’s never gonna happen, she’s seeing somebody.",,,,Monica,,
 (to Phoebe) Here you go. You can wear this. (hands her a sweater),,,,Monica,,
 Uh-huh.,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe?,,,,Monica,,
" All right. Honey, that’s-that’s a sleeve. Okay?",,,,Monica,,
 And! We also have speaker phone. (She turns on the speaker phone.),,,,Monica,,
" Okay, wait, you gotta hang up ‘cause we’re gonna be late.",,,,Monica,,
 Of course not.,,,,Monica,,
 There’s our star!,,,,Monica,,
 Hi!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. Where were you?,,,,Monica,,
 You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.,,,,Monica,,
" (entering from her bedroom) Pheebs, you’ve been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn’t healthy.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey! Didn’t you have that outfit on last night?,,,,Monica,,
" Anyway, how did it go with Kate?",,,,Monica,,
" Joey, you had the night!",,,,Monica,,
" When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!",,,,Monica,,
 Did you like learn about her family?,,,,Monica,,
 Yes!!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh! (They hug, triumphantly.)",,,,Monica,,
 One.,,,,Monica,,
 We’re kidding!,,,,Monica,,
" Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, it’s been two days.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 (sarcastic) Oh.,,,,Monica,,
 Pete's breaking up with me.,,,,Monica,,
" I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.",,,,Monica,,
 Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.,,,,Monica,,
 Really?!,,,,Monica,,
" (starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. Which one do you like more?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! (the lights turn on automatically, but are very bright) Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! (they dim) Oh, see you just need to find the right command.",,,,Monica,,
" No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.",,,,Monica,,
 I know.,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, put that down! (the phone rings) Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone! (steps in front of it, and automatically answers it)",,,,Monica,,
 I guess that's how.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh it’s umm, good! It's umm, it’s good, just here watering the plants.",,,,Monica,,
" Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh no-no-no, it's still me.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.",,,,Monica,,
 I love you.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my.,,,,Monica,,
 And that's Pete's Mom.,,,,Monica,,
" Would you stop? We’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose.",,,,Monica,,
" Well if-if that’s what it is, then it’s-it’s crazy.",,,,Monica,,
" Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.",,,,Monica,,
 Brides magazines?,,,,Monica,,
" It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazine shut in amazement.) I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. Right? I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.",,,,Monica,,
 I know. (pause) I need more pie. (goes and gets some),,,,Monica,,
" So then, are you going to dump Jason?",,,,Monica,,
" Ooh, nice.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah?,,,,Monica,,
 Wow.,,,,Monica,,
 What’s that?,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (not sure of herself),,,,Monica,,
 You wanna what?!,,,,Monica,,
 What are you talking about?,,,,Monica,,
 And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.,,,,Monica,,
 My parents will be so happy.,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" You’re not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...",,,,Monica,,
" So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...",,,,Monica,,
 (Robin is speaking loudly again) I...,,,,Monica,,
 Forget it. (they all turn and listen to Billy and Robin),,,,Monica,,
 (pause) I have no idea.,,,,Monica,,
 He didn’t ask me to marry him.,,,,Monica,,
 He wanted to tell me he’s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.,,,,Monica,,
 I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, but without the costumes.",,,,Monica,,
" So you can like, bite, and pull people’s hair and stuff?",,,,Monica,,
 What’s fish hooking?,,,,Monica,,
" I gotta tell ya, I think it’s okay to be that guy.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, can we please go eat?",,,,Monica,,
 (to Chandler) Anything but stew.,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hi!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want you to get hurt, ‘cause I kinda like you.",,,,Monica,,
 Promise me you’ll be careful.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, are we still on for tonight?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, good, ‘cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...",,,,Monica,,
 How ‘bout just a boom?,,,,Monica,,
" God Ross, what is that?",,,,Monica,,
" I love you, Pete!!!",,,,Monica,,
 (going up to the ring) Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey! (she sits down next to him) It’s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.,,,,Monica,,
" I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, you’re not gonna get going are you?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, no. But...",,,,Monica,,
 That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!,,,,Monica,,
 You didn’t know that already?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, just get a lot better. (pause) Fast.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. That-that was the problem.,,,,Monica,,
 (joining them) Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.",,,,Monica,,
" Four, please. (Ross looks at her) I’m really nervous. (Ross gives her the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)",,,,Monica,,
 Please tell me you’re stopping now.,,,,Monica,,
 You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!,,,,Monica,,
" Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!",,,,Monica,,
" Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it without me.",,,,Monica,,
 Then I’ve gotta go. Bye. (kisses him and starts to walk out),,,,Monica,,
 Yes?,,,,Monica,,
 Really?!,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, she was listing the countries she’s done it in.",,,,Monica,,
" (watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look",,,,Monica,,
 (sarcastic) Thanks!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah right.,,,,Monica,,
 You made a joke right? So I laughed.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, no. You’re Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the",,,,Monica,,
 Well I’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!",,,,Monica,,
" Seriously, where did you get the hat?",,,,Monica,,
 What’s with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 What are you crazy?!,,,,Monica,,
" Aww, thank you.",,,,Monica,,
 (to Phoebe) So what’s Phoebe like?,,,,Monica,,
" Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh well, where is he?!",,,,Monica,,
 (gasps) Totally familiar. (Phoebe shows the rest of them.),,,,Monica,,
" Well, why would she lie to you?",,,,Monica,,
 Strip Happy Days Game?,,,,Monica,,
 I think I’ll help her out. (She gets up to go over and help,,,,Monica,,
 You painting his toenails?,,,,Monica,,
 Chasing him all around the room?,,,,Monica,,
 He’s totally flirting with you too.,,,,Monica,,
 Huh?,,,,Monica,,
 You didn’t even take off your pants.,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Like a log.,,,,Monica,,
 That’s that weird voice again.,,,,Monica,,
 (closing the fridge in disgust) Shoot! We’re out of soda.,,,,Monica,,
 Really?!,,,,Monica,,
" Sweety, what are you talking about?",,,,Monica,,
 Oh.,,,,Monica,,
 Ennnh.,,,,Monica,,
 (screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!,,,,Monica,,
" Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!",,,,Monica,,
 It’s like two miles!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!,,,,Monica,,
 What?! What is it?!,,,,Monica,,
 What?!! Gross!!,,,,Monica,,
 Well forget it! It doesn’t hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad!!!!,,,,Monica,,
" Nothing, I don’t know.",,,,Monica,,
 Nothing. I’m gonna take a shower.,,,,Monica,,
" Pass the cheese, please.",,,,Monica,,
" My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?",,,,Monica,,
" What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.",,,,Monica,,
" (stopping him) No! Joey, we swore we’d never tell!",,,,Monica,,
 (interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the living room) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn’t stand. I-I couldn’t walk.,,,,Monica,,
 I was in too much pain.,,,,Monica,,
" You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So... (looks at Joey.)",,,,Monica,,
 You bet.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!!,,,,Monica,,
 (sets down some cards) Gin.,,,,Monica,,
 Will you stop!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, all right, I think you’re great, I think you’re sweet, and you’re smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.",,,,Monica,,
 Yesss!!,,,,Monica,,
 Shhh!,,,,Monica,,
" Chip, is Chip Matthews.",,,,Monica,,
" ‘Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.",,,,Monica,,
" I know!! (calls him) (on phone) Chip? Hi! It’s Monica. (listens) ‘Kay. (listens) ‘Kay. (listens) Okay. (listens) Okay, good-bye. (hangs up) Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!! (goes into her room as Rachel enters)",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?,,,,Monica,,
" What, that little thing at the prom?",,,,Monica,,
" Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?",,,,Monica,,
" Look, you and I went to different high schools...",,,,Monica,,
" You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.",,,,Monica,,
 It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.,,,,Monica,,
" Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, really?!",,,,Monica,,
 I’ll try.,,,,Monica,,
 Why can’t you use the phone in here?,,,,Monica,,
" Ross, don’t start.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, but it’s made her so happy.",,,,Monica,,
" He is right, isn’t he?",,,,Monica,,
 Hi!,,,,Monica,,
 (sliding into Joey’s place on the couch to try and talk to Phoebe) Huh? What’d ya say Joe? I’ll be right there. (gets up and joins Joey),,,,Monica,,
" (running from the bathroom to her room, wearing only a towel) Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! (gets to her room and closes the door, as Rachel gets up to answer the door.)",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!,,,,Monica,,
" That’s what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you’re Chip. Nevermind.",,,,Monica,,
 Wow! A lipper from Chipper.,,,,Monica,,
" Umm. Well, there’s Rachel, and umm, I think that’s it. How bout you?",,,,Monica,,
 Is that all?,,,,Monica,,
" Ohh, how is he?",,,,Monica,,
 Isn’t he an architect now?,,,,Monica,,
" Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, ‘cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don’t even know where you work?",,,,Monica,,
 I do?,,,,Monica,,
 You still work at the multiplex?,,,,Monica,,
" Thanks, I’m set. Do you still live with your parents?",,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Oh my God! What happened?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.",,,,Monica,,
" No, it’s okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.",,,,Monica,,
 I know!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.",,,,Monica,,
 Me too. (they all leave),,,,Monica,,
 (Entering from her bedroom) How desperate am I?,,,,Monica,,
 I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.,,,,Monica,,
" Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.",,,,Monica,,
 You don’t have to stick up for her. She can’t here you.,,,,Monica,,
" Doing great, the quiches are coming along.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I thought it was cute.",,,,Monica,,
 Let me ask you a question.,,,,Monica,,
 Why did you hire me?,,,,Monica,,
 (to Phoebe) Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I’m good.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’t so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good.",,,,Monica,,
 …I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. (Joey starts to nod ‘Yes.’),,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them.",,,,Monica,,
" (Looks at her nails) Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put… (realises) Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah, there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know which one.",,,,Monica,,
 Then why are you laughing?,,,,Monica,,
 What? You bet I’d lose a nail?,,,,Monica,,
 Frozen lasagnas?,,,,Monica,,
 You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was…,,,,Monica,,
" You promised Dr. Weinburg, you’d never use that phrase.",,,,Monica,,
" (laughs) That’s right. My Mom doesn’t have any faith in me! Oh, that’s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.",,,,Monica,,
 (interrupting) No! You have lasagnas! (Storms out and an awkward silence follows.),,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
" Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually thought she could change.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" (getting up) All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make.",,,,Monica,,
 Well?,,,,Monica,,
 Really?!,,,,Monica,,
 Yes!!,,,,Monica,,
 And you?,,,,Monica,,
" So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you…",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.",,,,Monica,,
 Wow!,,,,Monica,,
" That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don’t bite your nails.",,,,Monica,,
" (in a sexy voice) Hello, Chandler. (Phoebe has a huge smile on her face.)",,,,Monica,,
 Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War? (Joey is pissed),,,,Monica,,
 Rachel!,,,,Monica,,
 You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!,,,,Monica,,
 Have you ever taken out the trash? (Hands her the garbage.),,,,Monica,,
 Third door on the left.,,,,Monica,,
 God! If you’re gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to through it out.],,,,Monica,,
" Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just forget about it.",,,,Monica,,
 (Picking up a card from Chandler’s wallet.) My God! Is this a gym card?,,,,Monica,,
 What’s the matter?,,,,Monica,,
 So do them for free.,,,,Monica,,
 Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.,,,,Monica,,
 You’re gonna do some feet flirtin’!,,,,Monica,,
" What a minute, what did he say?",,,,Monica,,
 I told you not to go down there!,,,,Monica,,
 Rachel always cries!,,,,Monica,,
" Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you’ve never sucked before!",,,,Monica,,
 His dancing partner?!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, would you let it go already?! You’re fine!",,,,Monica,,
" Wait, now so you joined the gym?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, you could actually go to the gym.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?",,,,Monica,,
 Yes you did! You did like a little hop.,,,,Monica,,
 (laughing harder) You know the words! You are so into this!,,,,Monica,,
" All right, then show me some manly moves.",,,,Monica,,
 So you didn’t leave the bank?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my Gosh!,,,,Monica,,
" Just go up to her and ask her out. (Chandler laughs) Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.",,,,Monica,,
" Just be yourself. But, not too much.",,,,Monica,,
 That cold makes you sound so great.,,,,Monica,,
" Y'know what, I like Kathy.",,,,Monica,,
" (turning around and doing that, ""I'm making out with someone,"" thing with her hands) Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh! (She turns around and sees Gunther staring at her and stops suddenly.)",,,,Monica,,
" Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 Rachel's not here.,,,,Monica,,
 How's it going with her?,,,,Monica,,
" Hi, Josh.",,,,Monica,,
" So, did you play in college? (She points to his NYU Soccer (football for the rest of the world) sweatshirt he's wearing.)",,,,Monica,,
 Very!,,,,Monica,,
" It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.",,,,Monica,,
" (sneezes) Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.",,,,Monica,,
 (lying on the couch suffering from her cold) Ross isn't here.,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Why?,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you so much Phoebe.,,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing with those?!,,,,Monica,,
" Sorry, Phoebe.",,,,Monica,,
" Umm. (nodding her head, ""Good."")",,,,Monica,,
 Ohhhh!! Gross!!,,,,Monica,,
" No, sorry.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?",,,,Monica,,
" Ross, cough drops, please?",,,,Monica,,
 (interrupting) You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!,,,,Monica,,
" And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'",,,,Monica,,
" That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!",,,,Monica,,
" Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?",,,,Monica,,
" (Entering from her bedroom, talking on the phone) Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. (To the gang) I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.",,,,Monica,,
 Sixty guests.,,,,Monica,,
 Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.,,,,Monica,,
 I don't know.,,,,Monica,,
 Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, you're not working either.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow--the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!",,,,Monica,,
" Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. (Picks up two frying pans) Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look--I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, is everything in the car?",,,,Monica,,
 No. I hate this part.,,,,Monica,,
" No, that's not mine.",,,,Monica,,
" Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.",,,,Monica,,
" Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...",,,,Monica,,
 Just the matter of ...payment?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.",,,,Monica,,
" Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!",,,,Monica,,
 I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, that's great! Congratulations!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.",,,,Monica,,
 And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.,,,,Monica,,
" Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!",,,,Monica,,
 I can cook and you can take care of the money.,,,,Monica,,
" Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?",,,,Monica,,
 No?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.",,,,Monica,,
" He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, ""The Sound.""",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah!,,,,Monica,,
" (At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm… terrific.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!,,,,Monica,,
" (to Rachel and Phoebe) Y'know, there’s a Starbucks about three blocks down.",,,,Monica,,
" (to Phoebe) Hey, aren’t you up next?",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, Ross sucks!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!,,,,Monica,,
 Are you serious?,,,,Monica,,
 You obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends. (They all look at her) Which we all appreciate.,,,,Monica,,
 He loves you.,,,,Monica,,
 I remember you did.,,,,Monica,,
 (removing ear plugs) What?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.",,,,Monica,,
 We haven’t eaten yet!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.",,,,Monica,,
 Who cares? He works in a museum!,,,,Monica,,
 What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, y’know what, I can’t, it really kills.",,,,Monica,,
" No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend!",,,,Monica,,
 Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.,,,,Monica,,
 Yes!!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.",,,,Monica,,
 I was probably waiting for it to open.,,,,Monica,,
 You look great too.,,,,Monica,,
 So how does it look?,,,,Monica,,
 Like a pirate?!,,,,Monica,,
" Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her) Come on, one of us had to mention him.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh. Big family dinner tonight?,,,,Monica,,
 No way!,,,,Monica,,
 (disappointed) Oh.,,,,Monica,,
 (happy) Oh.,,,,Monica,,
" (sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirate’s voice) So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?",,,,Monica,,
 I know.,,,,Monica,,
 Why is it sick?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don’t you?",,,,Monica,,
 Me going out with Richard’s son.,,,,Monica,,
" Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian, (points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice dancer, (points to Joey) threw a girl’s wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler) livin’ in a box!! (goes to her room)",,,,Monica,,
" (running in from her bedroom) I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim.",,,,Monica,,
" Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.",,,,Monica,,
 And Joey.,,,,Monica,,
" My brother, Ross.",,,,Monica,,
 And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And that’s Chandler.,,,,Monica,,
" Umm, well, he’s…",,,,Monica,,
" All right everybody, this turkey is ready!",,,,Monica,,
" Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.",,,,Monica,,
 See he’s nice. Right?,,,,Monica,,
 I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.),,,,Monica,,
" Oh-ho-ho, we’ve got company.",,,,Monica,,
" (putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)",,,,Monica,,
 Thank you.,,,,Monica,,
 Y’know all my friends think this is weird.,,,,Monica,,
" I know! I mean it’s like me and your dad, that’s a totally separate thing.",,,,Monica,,
 We’re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?,,,,Monica,,
 Nothing. Nothing.,,,,Monica,,
" No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss…",,,,Monica,,
 (interrupting) Don’t say it!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah!,,,,Monica,,
 I know!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, he’s catching up to her!",,,,Monica,,
" Come on, no peeking! (They are leading the gang out with there hands over their eyes.)",,,,Monica,,
" All right, umm, we’re not gonna really keep it this way though.",,,,Monica,,
 (to Phoebe) Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, I’m gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.",,,,Monica,,
" Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence… dozens of people.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh no-no-no, it’s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh.,,,,Monica,,
" All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?",,,,Monica,,
 Hey! My first review is out!,,,,Monica,,
" All right, look at my on the back page.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, they don’t pay me a penny a word to make friends.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh! Do you need me to go with you?,,,,Monica,,
 Haven’t we made this decision?,,,,Monica,,
 Bye!,,,,Monica,,
 (answering it) Who is it?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, oh my God. (on intercom) Call me on the phone!",,,,Monica,,
" Look, I-I’m never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.",,,,Monica,,
 No! Phoebe!,,,,Monica,,
" I couldn’t eat it! I had five friends who couldn’t eat it, and one of them eats books.",,,,Monica,,
 The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!,,,,Monica,,
" All right, that I’ll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn’t it. You’re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?,,,,Monica,,
" Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, the owner of Allesandro’s came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!",,,,Monica,,
 Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!,,,,Monica,,
 You got the job?! Why didn’t you tell me?,,,,Monica,,
" Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. (Rachel excuses herself) Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.",,,,Monica,,
" I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it’s snowballing, y’know?",,,,Monica,,
 I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro’s.,,,,Monica,,
" It’s okay, ‘cause y'know what? You don’t really need me for the business.",,,,Monica,,
" All right. But umm, I-I-I’ll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving Rachel alone)",,,,Monica,,
" (entering) Ohh, here you are. Y’know, I’m-I’m glad you decided to hear me out.",,,,Monica,,
" I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.",,,,Monica,,
 Or! A bakery delivery person.,,,,Monica,,
 Pizza?!,,,,Monica,,
" All right, I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay. I’m guessing that if you don’t want to deliver, you probably don’t want to pick stuff up either.",,,,Monica,,
" Y’know what, let’s do the catering business.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y’know what, it’d be, it’d be fun.",,,,Monica,,
 Really?!,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you.,,,,Monica,,
"  Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... (Looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?",,,,Monica,,
" Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.",,,,Monica,,
" I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chef’s hat. (The hat says ‘Quit, bitch’)",,,,Monica,,
 I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and Monica glares at him.),,,,Monica,,
" I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting for my whole life.",,,,Monica,,
" I would love too, but I can’t! I mean I just can’t, you know that I’m not good at confrontation.",,,,Monica,,
" That’s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?",,,,Monica,,
" All right, you’re hired!",,,,Monica,,
 Didn’t your dad used to call you Pumpkin?,,,,Monica,,
" (getting up) All right, I’m gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?",,,,Monica,,
 You want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!,,,,Monica,,
" You bet your ass, I’m gonna fire you! Thank you.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" They baked it. I can’t take this anymore. I’m gonna call a meeting tonight, I’m gonna fire you tonight.",,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing?!,,,,Monica,,
 Thanks. (Joey’s still patting the burn spot) I think you got it!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?",,,,Monica,,
 Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here’s the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere…",,,,Monica,,
" (louder) A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. (She holds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! (Joey looks at the money he’s holding, and doesn’t speak up.) Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!",,,,Monica,,
 What the hell happened?!,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’ve got to fire you!",,,,Monica,,
 What kinda things have you been saying?,,,,Monica,,
 I need more swordfish. (to one of the assistant chefs) Can you get me some more swordfish?,,,,Monica,,
 You did a minute ago!,,,,Monica,,
 Fine!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I’m cold! (She spills something.) And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! (the door opens)",,,,Monica,,
 That’s not funny.,,,,Monica,,
" (starting to cry) I’m a good person. And I’m a good chef, and I don’t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y’know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is…",,,,Monica,,
 You do?,,,,Monica,,
 Well if you want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!,,,,Monica,,
 You bet your ass I’m gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! (Joey leaves) All right! Anybody else got a problem? How ‘bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?,,,,Monica,,
 How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it’s funny now?,,,,Monica,,
" Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, (to the kitchen worker from earlier) And you! Get the swordfish! (to another assistant chef) And you! Get a haircut!",,,,Monica,,
 Thanks.,,,,Monica,,
 Enough!,,,,Monica,,
" No, you've messed it up. You're stupid.",,,,Monica,,
 Are you serious?,,,,Monica,,
 What did you tell them?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I mean you'd be pregnant. I mean, pregnant.",,,,Monica,,
 We just want you to think it through.,,,,Monica,,
" In the beginning, you know, where it's all s*x and talking and s*x and talking...",,,,Monica,,
 And the s*x?,,,,Monica,,
 Then what is it?,,,,Monica,,
" Big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends. That doesn't mean he's good in bed.",,,,Monica,,
" Sweetie, with you it's going to be different. The s*x is going to be great 'cause you guys are in love.",,,,Monica,,
 I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me. [Rachel puts her arm consolingly around Monica],,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" [to Chandler] So, did you do it?",,,,Monica,,
" Uh-oh, was it bad?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, it was the first time. You know, there's not always a lot of agreement on the first time.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, I'm going to show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, hand me that pad over there. [Rach gets a pad and pen off the table and hands it to Monica.] All right. Now...[starts to draw]",,,,Monica,,
" Now, everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got, [starts labelling her diagram] one, two, three, [Chandler nods impatiently], four [now Chandle looks up, surprised], five, six, and seven.",,,,Monica,,
 [chuckles] Kind of an important one.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, now, most guys will hit one, two, and three and then go to seven and set up camp.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, uh the important thing is to take your time. You want to hit them all and you want to mix them up. You got to keep them on their toes.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, you could, uh, start with a little one; a two; a one, two, three; a three; a five; a four, a three-two; a two, a two-four-six; [Monica starts to get into it ] two-four-six; four [Rachel kind of moves back and stretches out] a two; [Monica now has her eyes closed and is getting visibly excited] two; four-seven; five-seven [Chandler looks away from both of them as if he can't believe what's happening]; six-seven; seven, seven, [faster] SEVEN, SEVEN, SEVEN-SEVEN-SEVEN-SEVEN-[Chandler looks at her in disbelief] SEVEN-SEVEN! [Monica, eyes still closed, leans back and shudders and says silently, while holding up seven fingers, ""seven"".]",,,,Monica,,
" You know, I never saw that.",,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
 [to Phoebe] It's going to be so great.,,,,Monica,,
 Would you surrogate?,,,,Monica,,
 What if I asked?,,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
" Boy, you are really not a morning person.",,,,Monica,,
 What kind of changes?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, good luck.",,,,Monica,,
 That is sooo not true!,,,,Monica,,
 I just—I can’t believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 Deal!,,,,Monica,,
 Ha-ha!,,,,Monica,,
" Aww, man!",,,,Monica,,
" That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.,,,,Monica,,
 Are you scared?,,,,Monica,,
 Ross will do it.,,,,Monica,,
" You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?",,,,Monica,,
 Same category?,,,,Monica,,
" Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!",,,,Monica,,
 No!!,,,,Monica,,
 I knew that! Rachel! Use you’re head!,,,,Monica,,
 Viva Las Gaygas!,,,,Monica,,
" You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.",,,,Monica,,
" Huh, wanna bet?",,,,Monica,,
" How about we play for more money, say 150?",,,,Monica,,
 You’re doing it again.,,,,Monica,,
 We won’t. (to Chandler) 300?,,,,Monica,,
 I’m just trying to spice it up!,,,,Monica,,
" I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?",,,,Monica,,
 Deal!,,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand. (Holds up her hand.)",,,,Monica,,
" No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.",,,,Monica,,
 Come on!,,,,Monica,,
 Come on!,,,,Monica,,
 Sandwiches!,,,,Monica,,
 Maurice.,,,,Monica,,
 And processing.,,,,Monica,,
" It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.",,,,Monica,,
 That’s not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!,,,,Monica,,
 NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!,,,,Monica,,
" Man, I feel like I’m coming down with something.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. (to Chandler) I bet you can’t guess what color my tonsils are? I’ll bet the apartment!,,,,Monica,,
 How do you feel?,,,,Monica,,
 Really?! How much?!,,,,Monica,,
" Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would’ve made them get rid of the birds. Right?",,,,Monica,,
" All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it’s all your fault.",,,,Monica,,
" Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!",,,,Monica,,
 Well?,,,,Monica,,
" It’s only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?",,,,Monica,,
 I’ll take care of it.,,,,Monica,,
 I lost our mattresses.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, don’t mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!",,,,Monica,,
 I can’t find garbage bags!,,,,Monica,,
 What is it?!,,,,Monica,,
 I can’t believe we’re living here!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just…(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)…throw your purses at it.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, are you out of a job?",,,,Monica,,
" Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.",,,,Monica,,
" If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now. (She takes back the turkey leg)",,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 You made pancakes?,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her pancakes.),,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",,,,Monica,,
 The players.,,,,Monica,,
" (laughs) Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.",,,,Monica,,
 Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!,,,,Monica,,
" Please, have some!",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I’ve just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, it’s just something I picked up.",,,,Monica,,
 Wait! Wait! This isn’t take-out!,,,,Monica,,
" No, wait, please don’t go! I’ve got p0rn for you too!",,,,Monica,,
 People are supposed to wanna hang out here!,,,,Monica,,
" I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.",,,,Monica,,
" ‘Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I’m-I’m done now. They’ve suffered enough.",,,,Monica,,
" All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s gonna be ten times better than that place!",,,,Monica,,
 Are you sure?,,,,Monica,,
" Nah, I got it.",,,,Monica,,
" (entering) Okay, it’s ready. Come on.",,,,Monica,,
 Just come.,,,,Monica,,
" Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?",,,,Monica,,
 You used to have carpet.,,,,Monica,,
" So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I’m just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I’m always the hostess.",,,,Monica,,
" (not wanting to be left out, picks up something) Hey umm, what’s this?",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Joey, I don’t think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?",,,,Monica,,
 What’s Phase Two?,,,,Monica,,
 You stink!,,,,Monica,,
" Uh-oh, what’s the matter?",,,,Monica,,
 I don’t know sweetie.,,,,Monica,,
 I can’t! I have to work!,,,,Monica,,
" No, Chandler’s still in Phase One, and Joey’s that thing you smell.",,,,Monica,,
 I think she’s here.,,,,Monica,,
" (looking out the peephole) Ohh, she’s looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can’t see people through that little hole, can you? (Goes back to the door.) Hello!",,,,Monica,,
 I-I-I think you look great.,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh wait, Joey, you can’t go like that! You stink!",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah. Run ten blocks, that’ll help the smell.",,,,Monica,,
 So? How did it go with Joshua last night?,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 So you hit her in the face?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey! You’re wearing pants!,,,,Monica,,
 It’s 9:30 in the morning!,,,,Monica,,
" Hello. (Listens) Oh, hey Ross!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh-oh, my God!",,,,Monica,,
" (to Chandler) Shh!! (On phone) Wait, what?",,,,Monica,,
 He’s with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!,,,,Monica,,
" He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.",,,,Monica,,
 Why do you care so much anyway?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.",,,,Monica,,
 A couple of days.,,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing?! Chandler! You can’t just go back a phase!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, come on, we can be guys!",,,,Monica,,
" (coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, I’ve got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?",,,,Monica,,
" Very good, (getting up and sliding a One into the dancer’s hot pants) so good.",,,,Monica,,
" (to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.,,,,Monica,,
 I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.),,,,Monica,,
" So, we did okay at the strip club, right?",,,,Monica,,
" What, he doesn’t like Josh?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah. And y’know, if you wanna cry, that’s okay too.",,,,Monica,,
 Come on! Chandler!,,,,Monica,,
" They really were pretty, weren’t they? (Rachel and Phoebe both agree)",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!",,,,Monica,,
" Y’know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler is intrigued.) It’d, it’d be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, Chantal!",,,,Monica,,
 Really?!,,,,Monica,,
 That’s-that’s not Phase Three.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Wait, now, what am I doing again?",,,,Monica,,
 Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?,,,,Monica,,
 Didn’t it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?,,,,Monica,,
 They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How can you not care?,,,,Monica,,
 Janice?!,,,,Monica,,
 How have you been?,,,,Monica,,
 Done?,,,,Monica,,
" This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don’t work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, well, I’m using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hear something! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises it’s Joey.)",,,,Monica,,
 He asked you out?!,,,,Monica,,
 Saucy!,,,,Monica,,
 Electrical plans for the building.,,,,Monica,,
" I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.",,,,Monica,,
 Hi!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they’d brighten up the place. They do don’t you think?",,,,Monica,,
" No-no-no, no!",,,,Monica,,
" I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that picture.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!",,,,Monica,,
 I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.,,,,Monica,,
" No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.",,,,Monica,,
 But it didn’t. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.,,,,Monica,,
 All right. The super couldn’t figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did. I’ve had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.,,,,Monica,,
" I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.",,,,Monica,,
 What is it hon?,,,,Monica,,
" Aww, honey I’m sorry.",,,,Monica,,
" I don’t know how museums work in England but, here, you’re not supposed to take stuff.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.",,,,Monica,,
 You changed?,,,,Monica,,
" And lucky means, more cleavage?",,,,Monica,,
" Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.",,,,Monica,,
 Or Spin the Bottle?,,,,Monica,,
 Two in a row! You’ve got to use your tongues now! (They kiss again.),,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?,,,,Monica,,
" Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can’t let—(pause), actually I kinda want to see what happens.",,,,Monica,,
 I think you’re done.,,,,Monica,,
" Well at least, I’m going to mute it.",,,,Monica,,
 Hi!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh. Why didn’t you take her?,,,,Monica,,
 You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free p0rn!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, cheer up! You’re gonna see her again, right?",,,,Monica,,
" (interrupting him) No-no-no, don’t-don’t do the accent. You’ve got to see her again.",,,,Monica,,
 Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!,,,,Monica,,
" No! Y’know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!",,,,Monica,,
 Do you love her?,,,,Monica,,
 You love her!,,,,Monica,,
" Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to the gate. You’re gonna call out her name and say, ""I love you!"" And she’s gonna say, ""I love you, too!"" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.",,,,Monica,,
" Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in… (Ross looks at her.) I’ve been watching too much p0rn.",,,,Monica,,
 Where ya going?,,,,Monica,,
 How did it go with Frank and Alice?,,,,Monica,,
 Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?,,,,Monica,,
" And well, what did she say?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you’re totally welcome! What’d she say?",,,,Monica,,
 It is not over! You’re over!,,,,Monica,,
 You know!,,,,Monica,,
" It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn’t, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, they didn’t make you pay for those knives, did they?",,,,Monica,,
 Are you sure?,,,,Monica,,
" This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, there can’t be another guy.",,,,Monica,,
 Of course there’s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!,,,,Monica,,
 You have to go to London!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, you have to go fight for her!",,,,Monica,,
" When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?",,,,Monica,,
" You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?",,,,Monica,,
" All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!",,,,Monica,,
 Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don’t let her go without a fight!,,,,Monica,,
 All right.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, good luck!",,,,Monica,,
" That’s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?",,,,Monica,,
 Hello.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?",,,,Monica,,
" All right. When is, when is the next flight out?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn’t show up by then, then just come on home.",,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing here? You can’t be here!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) I was right! (Points to Emily) I’m right, right?",,,,Monica,,
 Oh.,,,,Monica,,
 Y’know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people’s s*x clothes.,,,,Monica,,
 Um-hmm.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it, then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.",,,,Monica,,
" So, you wore your nightie to dinner?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, no!",,,,Monica,,
 Emily’s straight.,,,,Monica,,
 This totally makes sense!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!",,,,Monica,,
 This is so much fun!,,,,Monica,,
" Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.",,,,Monica,,
" Y’know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Shut up! This place is a hole!,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, apparently, they’re pretty good seats.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, what, do you think we’re stupid?",,,,Monica,,
 What do you say?,,,,Monica,,
 Have you even had a girl up here?,,,,Monica,,
" (entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!",,,,Monica,,
" All right, so what do you say?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, just do it!!",,,,Monica,,
 They’re green?,,,,Monica,,
 That’s not even a game!,,,,Monica,,
" You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, good.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (She picks a card.) Four.,,,,Monica,,
 Because we won our apartment back!,,,,Monica,,
" No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!",,,,Monica,,
" But, we pick again! We pick again!",,,,Monica,,
 I don’t know!,,,,Monica,,
" We’ll discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)",,,,Monica,,
" No, we’re not! We’re not leaving!",,,,Monica,,
" As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.",,,,Monica,,
 Men are such idiots.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true.",,,,Monica,,
 What-what’s going on?,,,,Monica,,
" When, when did—how, how did you…",,,,Monica,,
 (to Ross) I can’t believe you’re getting married!,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, that’s like your fourth cup of coffee!",,,,Monica,,
 He’s in a different room! He’s really that loud?,,,,Monica,,
" Y’know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over…",,,,Monica,,
 He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.,,,,Monica,,
 Have you guys picked a date yet?,,,,Monica,,
" Ugh, she’s upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I’m not doing them this time! I don’t care if those dishes sit in the sink until they’re all covered with—I’ll do them when I get home!",,,,Monica,,
 I’ll pick it up for you!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It’s so beautiful!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, yes, umm, I’m here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.",,,,Monica,,
 Emily Waltham.,,,,Monica,,
 (laughs) Okay.,,,,Monica,,
" I am, aren’t I?",,,,Monica,,
 Yes?,,,,Monica,,
 All right. (Goes to take off the dress.),,,,Monica,,
 Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does. (Looks at the wedding dress and stops.),,,,Monica,,
" Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. (There’s a knock on the door.) Uh, just a second!",,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe?,,,,Monica,,
 Can you just hold on for one minute?,,,,Monica,,
 Are you alone?,,,,Monica,,
 All right.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, ready?",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Congratulations!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay! My turn! My turn!,,,,Monica,,
 (cocking her head from side to side in some pre-bouquet-catching ritual) Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 (upset) That was a terrible throw!!,,,,Monica,,
" Look at me! My big concern is what’s real?! (Finally realises) Oh my God. We’re really sad, aren’t we?",,,,Monica,,
 This isn’t even my dress.,,,,Monica,,
 I’m changing out of this.,,,,Monica,,
 In like a half-hour?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, throw it straight this time.",,,,Monica,,
 I’m getting married next!!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn’t you start feeling silly?",,,,Monica,,
 Oh God.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?",,,,Monica,,
" No, seriously.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? ‘Cause I don’t think you have to wear it unless you are!",,,,Monica,,
" Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again.",,,,Monica,,
 Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emily’s wedding dress into Rachel’s room.),,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause) Maybe someday, there will be.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh God! He’s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!,,,,Monica,,
" No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us!",,,,Monica,,
 Rachel?!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (TO RACHEL) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? ",,,,Monica,,
" Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can’t believe my brother’s getting married! And in London! It’s so romantic!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 I never knew that either.,,,,Monica,,
 We’re hanging out.,,,,Monica,,
 I’m sorry honey.,,,,Monica,,
" Rach, you’re gonna come though aren’t you?",,,,Monica,,
" You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren’t there. Just say you’ll think about it, okay?",,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe he did this.,,,,Monica,,
" You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.",,,,Monica,,
" Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, dad, turn it off.",,,,Monica,,
 If you're not going then I don't want to go either.,,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe you did that.,,,,Monica,,
 (seeing the decision) Nooooo. You’re really not going?,,,,Monica,,
 You don’t have a car. And your license expired.,,,,Monica,,
 That’s also like the tenth time you told us.,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 I thought that was a good thing.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, there’s one right under the cabinet.",,,,Monica,,
 Why do you need it?,,,,Monica,,
" What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you’re having a party and we’re not invited?",,,,Monica,,
 Sooo?,,,,Monica,,
 Nooo!,,,,Monica,,
 The baby shower for Phoebe!,,,,Monica,,
 Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! (She shows Rachel what she bought. She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the babies.) Can you believe they make these for little people?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite. (It’s a little pink and white dress for the girl baby.)",,,,Monica,,
 I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!,,,,Monica,,
 Because she’s not gonna get to keep the babies.,,,,Monica,,
" Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she’s done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, she’s gonna love that!",,,,Monica,,
 Hi Phoebe.,,,,Monica,,
 Hormones.,,,,Monica,,
" Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That’s great. So how-how are things going?",,,,Monica,,
 Here’s your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a step back.),,,,Monica,,
 I’m so glad you liked it.,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
" Wait, you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’t sterilised it since the guys moved out!",,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, get the book! The book!",,,,Monica,,
 The Bible?!,,,,Monica,,
 How do you feel?,,,,Monica,,
 Some moms do that.,,,,Monica,,
" Aww, sweetie, but it’s not like you’re not gonna have anything. You’re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that’s even better.",,,,Monica,,
" I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about s*x.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
" Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)",,,,Monica,,
" Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera, check! Traveller’s cheques, check!",,,,Monica,,
" Myself. Y’know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realized it was weird.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 Yep! You got the tickets?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator…",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, okay, give that a try!",,,,Monica,,
" All right, y’know what? We really are late! Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!!",,,,Monica,,
 Chicken Kiev?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, y’know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn’t have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross pushes her.) So, I can’t wait to see this place you’re getting married!",,,,Monica,,
 It’s nice.,,,,Monica,,
" (entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.",,,,Monica,,
 They torn it down a few days early.,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" (laughs) Yes, I did! And you are welcome!",,,,Monica,,
 Umm…,,,,Monica,,
 She said that?!,,,,Monica,,
 Why?!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God. You’re even dumber than I am!,,,,Monica,,
" Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?",,,,Monica,,
" Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That’s what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets thrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.",,,,Monica,,
 Sometimes we were.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 You’ll see.,,,,Monica,,
" And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a little alcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), and… (Points to Ross) You go.",,,,Monica,,
 Ohh. And I don’t even have a date.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" Ha ha, a joke that’s funny in all countries.",,,,Monica,,
 (Looking nauseous from her parents kissing.) And I’m going to go get drunk. (Gets up to get a drink.),,,,Monica,,
 I was laughing. (Patting him on the knee.),,,,Monica,,
 Well I didn’t want everyone to think I was stupid.,,,,Monica,,
" My mother’s driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I’m happy. (A drunken man approaches.) I’m not going to let anything spoil that.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, thanks, we like him.",,,,Monica,,
 Then why would he say it?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, my mother’s right. I’m never going to get married.",,,,Monica,,
" Ohh, Please?! I’m a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!",,,,Monica,,
 (Comes up for below the covers and looks concerned.) Do you think he knew I was here? (Chandler quickly looks at Monica not knowing what to say.),,,,Monica,,
 (In am uneasy voice.) Nope. (She chuckles uneasily.),,,,Monica,,
" Yep, yep...You?",,,,Monica,,
 Well...I’d better get going.,,,,Monica,,
 (Scoots towards the side of the bed.) Could you not look?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.",,,,Monica,,
 (Angrily.) You can let some of them go by!(Judy and Andrea go to the front of the chapel. Joey approaches Monica.),,,,Monica,,
 (Awkwardly.) Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don’t even like Chandler.,,,,Monica,,
 Stupid.,,,,Monica,,
 What were we thinking?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh yeah. Definitely.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
 I know. How could we have let this happen?,,,,Monica,,
" Ugh! Well, y’know, we were away…",,,,Monica,,
 I blame London.,,,,Monica,,
" So look umm, while we’re st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?",,,,Monica,,
 Only here.,,,,Monica,,
 I’ll meet you there in two minutes.,,,,Monica,,
 (impatiently) Now?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I-I don’t know.",,,,Monica,,
" Just uh, do the right thing. (Uses some breath spray)",,,,Monica,,
" Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! (Tries to leave, but is stopped by Rachel.)",,,,Monica,,
" Wait. Rachel, no, he’s married. Married! If you don’t realize that, I can’t help you.",,,,Monica,,
 Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?,,,,Monica,,
 Why?!,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn’t eat meat until she has the babies!",,,,Monica,,
 That’s true.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!",,,,Monica,,
" Yes, I want to change. And why-why don’t you go down and get us a table?",,,,Monica,,
 (elbows him) Fifteen minutes.,,,,Monica,,
 Great…,,,,Monica,,
 But my clothes are—ohh! (They both leave.),,,,Monica,,
 No time for that!,,,,Monica,,
" Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It’s My Giant!",,,,Monica,,
 You really think this is okay?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, it’s so beautiful. Ohh! Y’know, I-I don’t know if I feel right about this.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay!,,,,Monica,,
 You didn’t find her?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I think you should keep looking!",,,,Monica,,
 Or 45.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, it’s getting late.",,,,Monica,,
" Ugh, y’know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.",,,,Monica,,
" I know, I’ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don’t you think?",,,,Monica,,
" Y’know, maybe it’s best that we never got to do it again.",,,,Monica,,
" I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?",,,,Monica,,
 I know!,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, I did not have s*x.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, we certainly are alone.",,,,Monica,,
" Right. Umm, listen since we’re-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross’s mother…",,,,Monica,,
" Well, an-anyway, I just—that night meant a lot to me, I guess I’m just trying to say thanks.",,,,Monica,,
 (laughs) That’s okay.,,,,Monica,,
 And you’re cute too.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 That counts!,,,,Monica,,
 You look cute in bubbles.,,,,Monica,,
 Chicken? I could eat some chicken.,,,,Monica,,
" Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?",,,,Monica,,
 Bodington's!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, (Checks watch) she should be here by now.",,,,Monica,,
" No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.",,,,Monica,,
" Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!",,,,Monica,,
 I'll do it!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, sweetie, by the edges.",,,,Monica,,
 Ohh. (Monica covers her eyes in horror.),,,,Monica,,
 Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.",,,,Monica,,
" If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to listen in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute.",,,,Monica,,
" (Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at another guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.",,,,Monica,,
" You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.",,,,Monica,,
 We got out pictures back from London. (Shows her one.) Here's all of us at the Tower of London.,,,,Monica,,
 What happened?,,,,Monica,,
" See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!",,,,Monica,,
 What took you so long?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, good.",,,,Monica,,
" Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.",,,,Monica,,
 (Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.,,,,Monica,,
 What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!,,,,Monica,,
" I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?",,,,Monica,,
 (Gasps) What?!! You cannot tell him that!!,,,,Monica,,
" I make the decisions, and I say no.",,,,Monica,,
" You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, ""I'm not fired!"" Ha!",,,,Monica,,
 Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!,,,,Monica,,
 Rachel locked the door.,,,,Monica,,
 Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!,,,,Monica,,
" Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?",,,,Monica,,
 I really need to talk to you.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.",,,,Monica,,
 Please!,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, I'm in!",,,,Monica,,
" Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in Central Park!",,,,Monica,,
" Makes me wanna puke! (Chandler looks at her, quizzically.)",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?",,,,Monica,,
" Come on Rach, let's go.",,,,Monica,,
" No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.),,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! You're water broke!,,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!,,,,Monica,,
 Do you know anything about women?,,,,Monica,,
 That's all right.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh man! I did it again!,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 That's what it sounded like.,,,,Monica,,
 Umm. (Looks at Chandler who is using the phone.) Umm. Umm. I don't think so.,,,,Monica,,
" Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.",,,,Monica,,
 Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?,,,,Monica,,
" Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.",,,,Monica,,
" Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.",,,,Monica,,
 Feeling a little better sweetie?,,,,Monica,,
 Me too.,,,,Monica,,
 (entering with Chandler) Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 (To Phoebe) How are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
" Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler!,,,,Monica,,
" So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, great!",,,,Monica,,
 Bye Dan!,,,,Monica,,
 Great!,,,,Monica,,
" Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.",,,,Monica,,
 I think you're better than you think you are.,,,,Monica,,
 (interrupting) Know when to stop.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around.) Don't do the dance.",,,,Monica,,
 I think you're my favorite.,,,,Monica,,
 I don't care.,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!",,,,Monica,,
 (In a sexy voice) Come in. I've been waiting for you.,,,,Monica,,
" (pulling on a robe) Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.",,,,Monica,,
" Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. (Thinks) I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!",,,,Monica,,
" Uh-huh, that one!",,,,Monica,,
" (Panicking) Okay, umm, okay, umm… (Rachel opens the door.) It's just Joey and Ross.",,,,Monica,,
 But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?,,,,Monica,,
" Vomit tux? Who vomited on—y'know what, what you up to Joe?",,,,Monica,,
 Oh that's great!,,,,Monica,,
 What's wrong with PBS?,,,,Monica,,
" Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",,,,Monica,,
 I might've said that. (Chandler laughs.) Why is that funny?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 That's great!,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 But you live here! (Ross rolls his eyes.) You know that.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.",,,,Monica,,
 Sure!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.",,,,Monica,,
 Great!,,,,Monica,,
 What?! You can't—what did you tell her?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.",,,,Monica,,
" No, you cannot.",,,,Monica,,
 (answering it) Hello.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?",,,,Monica,,
 (Looking at the TV) You're not on TV.,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hi Chandler.,,,,Monica,,
" Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.",,,,Monica,,
" William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, so?",,,,Monica,,
" Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.",,,,Monica,,
 Why? (She hops into the living room and imitates Chandler's happy dance.),,,,Monica,,
" A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!",,,,Monica,,
" All right, let me see. (She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have s*x tonight? (Reads the answer.) Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.",,,,Monica,,
 Keep talking.,,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into his arms.) Oh my… When is Joey gonna be home?",,,,Monica,,
" But, I just cleaned the bathroom.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. (She takes them off.),,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Ow!,,,,Monica,,
 I know!,,,,Monica,,
 Never done that before.,,,,Monica,,
 (quietly) Hi!,,,,Monica,,
" Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.",,,,Monica,,
 I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.,,,,Monica,,
 All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.,,,,Monica,,
" Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!",,,,Monica,,
 Wait! What about Joey?,,,,Monica,,
" (entering from her room) Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" No, she's out shopping.",,,,Monica,,
" Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?",,,,Monica,,
" Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles…",,,,Monica,,
" Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.",,,,Monica,,
" Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!",,,,Monica,,
" Come here. (He does, and they kiss.) Okay, be right back.",,,,Monica,,
 We're switching rooms.,,,,Monica,,
" No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. (He glares at her.) Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?",,,,Monica,,
 We're switching rooms again.,,,,Monica,,
" This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.",,,,Monica,,
" (To Chandler) Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler!,,,,Monica,,
" Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, this one I like!",,,,Monica,,
 Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!",,,,Monica,,
" I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!",,,,Monica,,
" We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?",,,,Monica,,
 What did you say?,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hi!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, it was awful. (To Chandler) I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler! (Motions for him to come outside.),,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.",,,,Monica,,
 300 dollars?!,,,,Monica,,
 Urghh!!,,,,Monica,,
 Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!,,,,Monica,,
 Maybe I could do it.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
 You're not gonna be phased out!,,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, it did.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Why, exactly?",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh! (They both realize something there.),,,,Monica,,
" (laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.",,,,Monica,,
" Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)",,,,Monica,,
 I'm afraid so.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.",,,,Monica,,
" Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!",,,,Monica,,
" Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.",,,,Monica,,
" I know, it's great!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.",,,,Monica,,
 Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.,,,,Monica,,
" Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!",,,,Monica,,
" Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! (They all leave and close the door on Monica.) Ohhh! (Throws her notepad down in disgust.)",,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 Sorry.,,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) Rachel's at work.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, what's that?",,,,Monica,,
 What is that?,,,,Monica,,
 (looking at the flyer) This is all of your things.,,,,Monica,,
" So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.",,,,Monica,,
 Now calm down Joey.,,,,Monica,,
" Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?",,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.",,,,Monica,,
" All right. (Looking through a box.) Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!,,,,Monica,,
" We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!",,,,Monica,,
" And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!",,,,Monica,,
 We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 Wow! That guy is so rude!,,,,Monica,,
 Well you did a little bit.,,,,Monica,,
 I totally forgive you!,,,,Monica,,
 Yes!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 Crematorium Chris? Sure!,,,,Monica,,
" Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.",,,,Monica,,
" No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.",,,,Monica,,
" God, I feel so guilty about Ross.",,,,Monica,,
" Whatever you decide, whatever you do.",,,,Monica,,
 Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, look at you! Where have you been?",,,,Monica,,
 How did that happen?,,,,Monica,,
" I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.",,,,Monica,,
" Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.",,,,Monica,,
" I'll get it. (On phone.) Hello. (Listens.) Hi Emily! (Listens.) Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. (She hands the phone to Ross.)",,,,Monica,,
 How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, Larry.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.",,,,Monica,,
 Larry?,,,,Monica,,
" Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.",,,,Monica,,
" It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.",,,,Monica,,
 Thanks.,,,,Monica,,
 Hmm?,,,,Monica,,
" He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try…",,,,Monica,,
" Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.",,,,Monica,,
 (To Monica) Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?,,,,Monica,,
" Ohh, fun!",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.",,,,Monica,,
 And you're not gonna do that.,,,,Monica,,
 So-so there is no party.,,,,Monica,,
" I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.",,,,Monica,,
 You are?,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!,,,,Monica,,
 Great. So the ball is in his court?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" I don't know, clean places?",,,,Monica,,
 (looking through the peephole) It's Danny.,,,,Monica,,
 (to Danny) We'll be right there! (To Rachel) Can't you just say it starts later?,,,,Monica,,
 The fake kind!,,,,Monica,,
 We have a ladle. (Gives him one.),,,,Monica,,
" Okay, great!",,,,Monica,,
 Just go over and say hi.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Danny!",,,,Monica,,
" (turns his back to the stairs) Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (As she's saying this Rachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. She quickly retreats back up the stairs.) (Sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) So umm, what's this? (Points to his plate.)",,,,Monica,,
 Ooooh! (Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-and what-what's this? (Points again.),,,,Monica,,
 (upon seeing Rachel she points) Oh.,,,,Monica,,
 I thought there wasn't a ball?,,,,Monica,,
 I think I need a drink.,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.",,,,Monica,,
 That's very nice.,,,,Monica,,
 Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, let's not tell this story.",,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, did you get the turkey basted—Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?",,,,Monica,,
 What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, get it off now!",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. (Joey starts giggling.) Joey? Now is not the time!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!",,,,Monica,,
 That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.,,,,Monica,,
" Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.",,,,Monica,,
" Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!",,,,Monica,,
" I'll get it! (She runs in, and she's her old fat self like The One With The Prom Video. Not only that, she's out of breath after running a short distance. She goes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.) Happy Thanksgiving!",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I do.",,,,Monica,,
" Yes, it was!",,,,Monica,,
" (interrupting her) Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!",,,,Monica,,
" Hi, Chandler.",,,,Monica,,
" What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? (She turns around making sure he gets a good look.)",,,,Monica,,
" So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.",,,,Monica,,
 Well it didn't!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!",,,,Monica,,
 How?,,,,Monica,,
" What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have s*x with him?",,,,Monica,,
 What do you mean?,,,,Monica,,
 (excited) I can do that!,,,,Monica,,
" Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up the box and decides to follow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.",,,,Monica,,
" Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch of them and holds them between her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife (She picks up a knife without putting the box down. She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder) and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body. (She doesn't have any exposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and the box between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)",,,,Monica,,
" Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that—(She drops the box and in a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flips through the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe.)",,,,Monica,,
" Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice! (She takes a bag of ice out of her purse and hands it to the doctor.)",,,,Monica,,
 What?! What is it?,,,,Monica,,
" God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!",,,,Monica,,
" Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!",,,,Monica,,
 I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.,,,,Monica,,
 I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!,,,,Monica,,
 Chandler! (Follows him out.),,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, I said I was sorry.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?",,,,Monica,,
" Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)",,,,Monica,,
" Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)",,,,Monica,,
 I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.),,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 You said you loved me! I can't believe this!,,,,Monica,,
" Yes, you did!",,,,Monica,,
 You love me!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah!,,,,Monica,,
" (entering) Thank you Joey, thank you so much!",,,,Monica,,
" (inspecting his leg) Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.",,,,Monica,,
" We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.",,,,Monica,,
 We are! Help us!,,,,Monica,,
 Joey!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Phoebe!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but (motions that he can have it.)",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, you are a bad ass!",,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.",,,,Monica,,
 We're so sorry.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a Polaroid.)",,,,Monica,,
 I know.,,,,Monica,,
" Ross, are you okay?",,,,Monica,,
 Why?!,,,,Monica,,
 A pill?,,,,Monica,,
" Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?",,,,Monica,,
 (yelling and waving her hand in the air) I know! I know! I know!,,,,Monica,,
 (grabbing the picture) Give me that!,,,,Monica,,
 It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!,,,,Monica,,
 Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh no!,,,,Monica,,
 Yes it's true.,,,,Monica,,
 I guess I wanted to keep it (Pause) as a souvenir.,,,,Monica,,
 I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.,,,,Monica,,
 I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.,,,,Monica,,
" (entering, happily) All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!",,,,Monica,,
 Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! (Running out) We should have essay questions!!,,,,Monica,,
" You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular. (Chandler laughs.)",,,,Monica,,
" Danny? You know Rachel? She’s nice. She’s not bad to look at, right?",,,,Monica,,
 Do you want to go out on a date with her?,,,,Monica,,
 Friday’s perfect...She can’t wait.,,,,Monica,,
 (Walking in from off screen.) Phoebe!,,,,Monica,,
 I just wanted to see how it's going.,,,,Monica,,
" (Taking out her wallet.) Well good, here let me help you out.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. I guess. (She puts more money in the bucket.),,,,Monica,,
" Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? (She pours out the rest of her change purse into the bucket.)",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, what's up?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, honey, I'm sorry.",,,,Monica,,
 You had no relationship!!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.",,,,Monica,,
" Come on, hurry!",,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 Eww!! (Throws the bucket down.),,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.",,,,Monica,,
" Still, I was quick as a cat.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you're kidding.",,,,Monica,,
" (laughing with Ross) We don't, we don't wrestle now.",,,,Monica,,
 Too strong for me?,,,,Monica,,
" You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?",,,,Monica,,
 Ready? (They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They start wrestling.),,,,Monica,,
 That was unbelievable!,,,,Monica,,
" Hi, how are you doing Kelly?",,,,Monica,,
 It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?,,,,Monica,,
 This is disgusting!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh no, wait! Joey!",,,,Monica,,
 Happy New Year.,,,,Monica,,
 She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.",,,,Monica,,
" Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.",,,,Monica,,
 Hi Ben!,,,,Monica,,
 I like 'em.,,,,Monica,,
 I like them a lot.,,,,Monica,,
 It's my New Year's resolution!,,,,Monica,,
 No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you. (Leaves.),,,,Monica,,
 (on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.,,,,Monica,,
" (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…",,,,Monica,,
" We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! (Shows him Ben's picture.) Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!",,,,Monica,,
" See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.",,,,Monica,,
" Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?",,,,Monica,,
 I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.,,,,Monica,,
" Ooh, and I can do this. (She kisses him on the cheek.)",,,,Monica,,
" Hi, nice to meet you!",,,,Monica,,
 What was that?,,,,Monica,,
 That noise you just made?,,,,Monica,,
 Really? Your work laugh?,,,,Monica,,
" All right, check me out.",,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, I thought you already had one.",,,,Monica,,
 Hi!,,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.,,,,Monica,,
" Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. Umm…,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, what's going on with you?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I-I—there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.",,,,Monica,,
" Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?",,,,Monica,,
 Game!,,,,Monica,,
" Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!",,,,Monica,,
" I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.",,,,Monica,,
" Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.",,,,Monica,,
 They have racquets don't they?!,,,,Monica,,
 I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.,,,,Monica,,
 I got it! (She hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between Doug and Kara and scores a point.),,,,Monica,,
 I got it!!,,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe you let them win!,,,,Monica,,
 I was frustrated.,,,,Monica,,
 I was frustrated with you!,,,,Monica,,
" Y'know what really bothers me? Is—it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the ""I'll see you around, Bing!"" ""Not if I see you first, Doug!"" (Mocks the fake laugh.) I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.",,,,Monica,,
" I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God! (She goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.) Where the hell have you been?!!",,,,Monica,,
 My turn? What-what are you talking about?,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big…(Thinks)…ot.",,,,Monica,,
 Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.,,,,Monica,,
 Me and Chandler?! (Does her fake laugh.),,,,Monica,,
" Oh, none for me. Thanks.",,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?,,,,Monica,,
" Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.",,,,Monica,,
 I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.,,,,Monica,,
" (interrupting) Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?",,,,Monica,,
 I thought you could use the help.,,,,Monica,,
 Sorry! I'm just—I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!,,,,Monica,,
 I know! It's just that…ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.,,,,Monica,,
" (entering) Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!",,,,Monica,,
 Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the fact that she's wearing men's boxers.],,,,Monica,,
 Okay great!,,,,Monica,,
" Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!",,,,Monica,,
" Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 I'll get back to my new job.,,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!,,,,Monica,,
 That was a half an hour?,,,,Monica,,
" Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!",,,,Monica,,
" It's so good, isn't it?",,,,Monica,,
 Say good-bye to sore muscles!,,,,Monica,,
" (entering, in a hurry) Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having s*x in a car right outside.",,,,Monica,,
" Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.",,,,Monica,,
" (to the guys) Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?",,,,Monica,,
 What?! What honey?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, did you catch him?!",,,,Monica,,
" All right, let's go say good-bye.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, at least you scared someone.",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.",,,,Monica,,
 What are you talking about?,,,,Monica,,
 (indignant) I give good massages! (Ross laughs.) I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! (She starts giving Chandler a massage.),,,,Monica,,
 No he's not!,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.,,,,Monica,,
 But the minute we start to lie to each other… (Pauses after she realizes what she's saying.) And by 'we' I mean society.,,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me—just say, ""I don't like your massages.""",,,,Monica,,
 (starting to cry) See? It's no big deal.,,,,Monica,,
 I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.,,,,Monica,,
 (bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! You don't know me at all!,,,,Monica,,
 I'm crying here!!,,,,Monica,,
" Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?",,,,Monica,,
" So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. I suck!,,,,Monica,,
" Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.",,,,Monica,,
 You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, now you're even cuter!!",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 What are you talking about?,,,,Monica,,
 That's not possible!,,,,Monica,,
" I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.",,,,Monica,,
" I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.",,,,Monica,,
 This bicep?,,,,Monica,,
" Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?",,,,Monica,,
 Well what did you send?,,,,Monica,,
 Bye!,,,,Monica,,
" Actually, I did!",,,,Monica,,
" Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!",,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!,,,,Monica,,
 Them?! Who's them?,,,,Monica,,
 Joey!,,,,Monica,,
 Unless…,,,,Monica,,
" Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So…",,,,Monica,,
" (in the kitchen with Chandler) Look at them, they're-they're panicked!",,,,Monica,,
 Oh yeah!,,,,Monica,,
" All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have s*x with her! It'll totally freak her out!",,,,Monica,,
" Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!",,,,Monica,,
 Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!,,,,Monica,,
 Just go get some! (Kisses him.) Go! (She runs to hide in the bathroom.),,,,Monica,,
 She's bluffing!,,,,Monica,,
 You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!,,,,Monica,,
 Of course.,,,,Monica,,
 I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.),,,,Monica,,
" Well actually, Ross doesn't.",,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing?!,,,,Monica,,
" Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. (They go to the door. Ross is trying to stick his hand through and undo the chain; Monica pushes his hand back.) (To Ross) Hold on! (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?",,,,Monica,,
" I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.",,,,Monica,,
" Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.",,,,Monica,,
 But what?,,,,Monica,,
" In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?",,,,Monica,,
" I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?",,,,Monica,,
 Isn't this great?,,,,Monica,,
 Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.) Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?,,,,Monica,,
 Are you okay?,,,,Monica,,
 What-what are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
" Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!",,,,Monica,,
 Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh and you know what I want!,,,,Monica,,
 I do not have baby fever!,,,,Monica,,
" Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!",,,,Monica,,
 You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.),,,,Monica,,
" Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?",,,,Monica,,
 I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
" Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)",,,,Monica,,
 (raising her hand) I'm Monica.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!,,,,Monica,,
" No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, why are you doing this?",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler.,,,,Monica,,
" Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?",,,,Monica,,
" (kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.",,,,Monica,,
 Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!,,,,Monica,,
 Who? Two divorces and Joey?!,,,,Monica,,
" Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?",,,,Monica,,
" Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" (checks to see if it works) Yes, you are so smart! (Kisses him.)",,,,Monica,,
 I know.,,,,Monica,,
 Wow!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?",,,,Monica,,
" I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.",,,,Monica,,
 Are you saying I smell bad?,,,,Monica,,
 What's with him?,,,,Monica,,
" (cooking something) Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!",,,,Monica,,
" Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. (Holds out a spoon for him.)",,,,Monica,,
 What is going on with you?,,,,Monica,,
 What was the dream about?,,,,Monica,,
" Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love with me!",,,,Monica,,
 No!,,,,Monica,,
" Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.",,,,Monica,,
 Um-hmm.,,,,Monica,,
" Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! (Looking at Chandler and slowly realizing what his point is.) But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!",,,,Monica,,
 You become friends after?,,,,Monica,,
 (laughing) That's right.,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!",,,,Monica,,
 What about the closeness?,,,,Monica,,
 Who is it?,,,,Monica,,
 Let me try. (Gets up to join them.),,,,Monica,,
 Did I squeeze it too hard?,,,,Monica,,
 Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?,,,,Monica,,
" Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!",,,,Monica,,
" (joining him) Wow! She is pretty, huh?",,,,Monica,,
 What happened?,,,,Monica,,
" No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?",,,,Monica,,
 I know it is the best.,,,,Monica,,
 What? It's still going on.,,,,Monica,,
" I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.",,,,Monica,,
 (Start annoying hyper-competitive mode now.) (Jumping up) What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don’t you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!",,,,Monica,,
 You are so cute. (She goes over and kisses him passionately.),,,,Monica,,
" (entering from the bathroom) Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!",,,,Monica,,
 Yes!,,,,Monica,,
 A kiss? What are you talking about?,,,,Monica,,
 He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?",,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
" (That annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again, what the heck is that with her and why must the writers show it every flippin' episode?!) Oh, we're not seeing a movie!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (She gets up and walks over to Chandler.) Chandler? Can I see you for a second?,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (They walk away to get some privacy.) We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.},,,,Monica,,
" 'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!",,,,Monica,,
 So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of s*x to prove them wrong!,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.,,,,Monica,,
 We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.,,,,Monica,,
" No, you're the best.",,,,Monica,,
 I am the best.,,,,Monica,,
 (looking out the window) Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?,,,,Monica,,
 Why?,,,,Monica,,
" What are you talking about? (Pointing out the window.) She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!",,,,Monica,,
" No, those first two windows, (Points) that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.",,,,Monica,,
" You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.",,,,Monica,,
 You didn't!,,,,Monica,,
 The park huh? A public place.,,,,Monica,,
 I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! (Gets up and heads for the bathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.),,,,Monica,,
 Hi Chandler.,,,,Monica,,
 Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?,,,,Monica,,
" Come on, we can't let them win!",,,,Monica,,
 Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!,,,,Monica,,
 I feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore.,,,,Monica,,
 Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?,,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. (They hug.),,,,Monica,,
 Did not.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I freaked out a little.",,,,Monica,,
 Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!,,,,Monica,,
" Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.",,,,Monica,,
" I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.",,,,Monica,,
 I would love to do it together!,,,,Monica,,
 It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.,,,,Monica,,
 That doesn't seem fair.,,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, me too! (Runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.)",,,,Monica,,
" All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, we're not doing that. Okay…",,,,Monica,,
" What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!",,,,Monica,,
 (Thinks) Cups.,,,,Monica,,
 And ice!,,,,Monica,,
" Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant…",,,,Monica,,
 Hey! How'd the audition go?!,,,,Monica,,
" Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's (sadly) ""Audition didn't go so well. (Happily) Yeah it did?""",,,,Monica,,
 You got a callback too didn't you?,,,,Monica,,
 (To Rachel) How did work go?,,,,Monica,,
 You stink!,,,,Monica,,
" No, I'm-I'm serious!",,,,Monica,,
 That's so gross!,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding. (She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)",,,,Monica,,
 (overhearing that) Why don't you just go out with her!,,,,Monica,,
 Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!,,,,Monica,,
 Y'know…go! Go! Right there! (Points),,,,Monica,,
 That's the surprise!,,,,Monica,,
 (entering from the bathroom) Hey! Happy Anniversary!,,,,Monica,,
" So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London…",,,,Monica,,
 Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?,,,,Monica,,
 That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.,,,,Monica,,
 That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.,,,,Monica,,
 (runs over to Phoebe) You have got to go home!,,,,Monica,,
 You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.,,,,Monica,,
 Great!,,,,Monica,,
 (noticing Rachel crawling behind the couch) Rach? What are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
 It's a diaper commercial.,,,,Monica,,
 What's goin' on?,,,,Monica,,
" It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.",,,,Monica,,
" It's no big deal, I do it all the time.",,,,Monica,,
 Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, this actually bothers you?",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" (following her) Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.",,,,Monica,,
 No you didn't.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, it's good.",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler! (Joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which they do.) Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.",,,,Monica,,
" Go on, teach me something about men and women.",,,,Monica,,
 No way!,,,,Monica,,
 Well that's pathetic!,,,,Monica,,
 And this goes for all guys?,,,,Monica,,
 No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!,,,,Monica,,
 (entering from her room) Phoebe! (Motions for the earrings. Phoebe gives her the one-minute sign.),,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, what is it?",,,,Monica,,
" (shocked) Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.",,,,Monica,,
 Look at you! Come here! (They hug.) Feel better?,,,,Monica,,
" (angrily) That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! (Rachel looks over at Phoebe in resignation.) Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!",,,,Monica,,
 Yes!,,,,Monica,,
 What about these? These look the same?,,,,Monica,,
 Not as each other!,,,,Monica,,
 Hi!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
" Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, honey, the earrings…",,,,Monica,,
 My boyfriend really does have good taste!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know… And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See? (Hands her the photo.)",,,,Monica,,
" You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.",,,,Monica,,
 I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.,,,,Monica,,
" All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.",,,,Monica,,
" Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around…",,,,Monica,,
" What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!",,,,Monica,,
 (on the answering machine) Rach! It's me! Pick up!,,,,Monica,,
" I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.",,,,Monica,,
 See if he has ice.,,,,Monica,,
 (does Rachel's) Nooo!,,,,Monica,,
" Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!",,,,Monica,,
" We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?",,,,Monica,,
" I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?",,,,Monica,,
" No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. (Rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (Realizing what she just said.) Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! (Rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.) Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.",,,,Monica,,
" Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, I guess we should go.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh yeah right! (She grabs the money and shoves into her pocket.),,,,Monica,,
 There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.",,,,Monica,,
 Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!,,,,Monica,,
" Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.",,,,Monica,,
 No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.,,,,Monica,,
" So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?",,,,Monica,,
 (shocked) Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
 I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?,,,,Monica,,
" I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral…",,,,Monica,,
 (sitting down) Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!,,,,Monica,,
" He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!",,,,Monica,,
 Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!,,,,Monica,,
 Ohhhh!,,,,Monica,,
 That is so sweet! (She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her tea.),,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hey guys!,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. (Goes to the counter) It was right here, where is it?",,,,Monica,,
" All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!",,,,Monica,,
" Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!",,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 Really?!,,,,Monica,,
" (on phone, faking she's sick) I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch it way over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes!! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sick again) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. (Hangs up and keeps throwing the ball.)",,,,Monica,,
 Rach?,,,,Monica,,
" You have scratches all over you, what happened? (Rachel's arms are covered with scratches.)",,,,Monica,,
 (shocked) What?!,,,,Monica,,
 I don't want a cat!,,,,Monica,,
 (To Rachel) What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!,,,,Monica,,
 (jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!,,,,Monica,,
 He's a dropper!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my—Oh good God!,,,,Monica,,
" So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?",,,,Monica,,
" Rach, why won't they take it back?",,,,Monica,,
" Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! (Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.",,,,Monica,,
 So you're moving in with him. What happened?,,,,Monica,,
" Why, do you write him a lot?",,,,Monica,,
 Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!,,,,Monica,,
 Please! I made this game what it is.,,,,Monica,,
" All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?",,,,Monica,,
" All right! Let's go! (Runs to the door.) Let's go Team Monica! (The guys all stop and stare at her) All right, we can work out the name later.",,,,Monica,,
 Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!,,,,Monica,,
 Wow! You made a profit!,,,,Monica,,
" All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!",,,,Monica,,
" It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! (Runs out the door and everyone watches her leave.)",,,,Monica,,
 (To Rachel) Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.,,,,Monica,,
" Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!",,,,Monica,,
 It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I? (And on the ""I"" part she mimics poking her eye.)",,,,Monica,,
 Bye!,,,,Monica,,
 Why are so mad at him?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, it just seems that…",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. (Quietly) You can go.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!",,,,Monica,,
" No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! (She ushers Rachel out the door, but before the door fully closes she sticks her head back in.) Chandler!!!! (Chandler agrees to clean up the mess.)",,,,Monica,,
 (looks at it more closely) Oh that's an eye removal machine.,,,,Monica,,
 I'm kidding! I'm kidding!,,,,Monica,,
" A small puff of air, now come on!",,,,Monica,,
" Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (Monica backs off.),,,,Monica,,
 Dr. Miller? (She covers her right eye and reads from the chart) P E C F D.,,,,Monica,,
" I sure do! (She runs over to a drawer, opens it, and grabs a lollipop.) (To Rachel) And you don't get one!",,,,Monica,,
 They're still in my coat.,,,,Monica,,
 I love you.,,,,Monica,,
 I wanna say good-bye at the car!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler! What are you doing here?,,,,Monica,,
 Not even close.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay! All right! Let's do it!,,,,Monica,,
 Sit down. (They sit down on the couch.),,,,Monica,,
 Put your head back.,,,,Monica,,
 All right.,,,,Monica,,
" Now, open your eyes.",,,,Monica,,
 How many fingers am I holding up? (She's not holding any up.),,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, I was thinking four.",,,,Monica,,
" Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?",,,,Monica,,
 No drops!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
" On three, 1…2…3! (Rachel turns her head on three to avoid the drops.) Now my pillow's all wet! (She was trying to fool Rachel and squeezed the eyedropper.)",,,,Monica,,
 Then why did you move?!,,,,Monica,,
" All right, come here! (She gets up and drags Rachel off of the couch by her legs.)",,,,Monica,,
 I am going… I'm going--Turn it over! (Rachel rolled onto her stomach and Monica rolls her back.) I'm… I am going to get these drops in your eyes. (She is holding Rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth.),,,,Monica,,
 (spitting out the eyedropper) Damn! It's empty!,,,,Monica,,
 (answers the phone) Hello? (Listens.) (To Phoebe) It's Joey. (Phoebe's proud of herself.) (To Joey) I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.,,,,Monica,,
 What did you do to his sweater vests?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. (She hands the phone to Phoebe.)",,,,Monica,,
" Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.",,,,Monica,,
 (answering it) Hello?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!",,,,Monica,,
" Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?",,,,Monica,,
 Go!!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay! Okay! Okay! (She succeeds in getting the eye drops in and everyone climbs off of Rachel.) We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.,,,,Monica,,
" (entering) Phoebe? (Phoebe comes back into the living room) Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.",,,,Monica,,
 The Richard.,,,,Monica,,
" Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?",,,,Monica,,
" It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.",,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!",,,,Monica,,
 Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.,,,,Monica,,
 I know.,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 It's almost our anniversary!,,,,Monica,,
 I got you a present!,,,,Monica,,
" I know, but you have to open it today! (Hands it too him.)",,,,Monica,,
 (grabbing the gift from him and opening it) Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!,,,,Monica,,
" For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.",,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!",,,,Monica,,
" But we can go, right?",,,,Monica,,
 Okay!,,,,Monica,,
" Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!",,,,Monica,,
 Aww! I love you!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay!,,,,Monica,,
" I love the ""I forgot the present"" fake out!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh that's okay. Don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.",,,,Monica,,
 Really?!,,,,Monica,,
 Great!,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, you don't eat animals.",,,,Monica,,
 Who are you talking too?,,,,Monica,,
 I'm so sorry.,,,,Monica,,
 I knew you were not okay with that.,,,,Monica,,
" It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?",,,,Monica,,
 You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.,,,,Monica,,
" I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.",,,,Monica,,
" I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.",,,,Monica,,
 Fine! Happy Anniversary!,,,,Monica,,
 No it is not!,,,,Monica,,
 (to the bartender) Thank you.,,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!,,,,Monica,,
" This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.",,,,Monica,,
 Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! (Gets up to find Chandler.),,,,Monica,,
 Anybody lose this? (Holds up the chip and the woman next to her shakes her head no.),,,,Monica,,
 Hmm.,,,,Monica,,
" All right baby, come on! (Rolls the dice) Yes! Yes! I am on fire!",,,,Monica,,
" Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!",,,,Monica,,
" What? Wait! Why? (He turns and heads for the door and she chases after him.) Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I’m sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!",,,,Monica,,
 Not any more.,,,,Monica,,
" Really! (They hug and kiss) All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. (She picks up his suitcase.) Okay, this is empty.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.",,,,Monica,,
 We have one.,,,,Monica,,
 (shaking the dice) A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! (Rolls the dice.) Yes!,,,,Monica,,
" That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?",,,,Monica,,
 Pick a number! That is your only job!,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you!,,,,Monica,,
 Yes!,,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (Rolls the dice),,,,Monica,,
" All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on! (Rolls the dice.)",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich—Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?",,,,Monica,,
 Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!,,,,Monica,,
 Shut up!! It just got interesting!,,,,Monica,,
 What did you just say?,,,,Monica,,
 Are you serious?!,,,,Monica,,
 I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay!,,,,Monica,,
" Nobody move! (To Chandler) Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!",,,,Monica,,
 That could be a four or a five. It's your call.,,,,Monica,,
 I think so too.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.",,,,Monica,,
 You're so efficient. I love you!,,,,Monica,,
 No-no-no! We need something old!,,,,Monica,,
 That'll work!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, now we just need something borrowed!",,,,Monica,,
 That's stealing!,,,,Monica,,
 Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.),,,,Monica,,
" Yep, we wanna get married!",,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
" No, only because that's the graduation song.",,,,Monica,,
 Are you sure you wanna do this?,,,,Monica,,
 Are you sure you wanna do this?,,,,Monica,,
 Whoa!,,,,Monica,,
 What are you guys doing here?,,,,Monica,,
 Why else would we be here?,,,,Monica,,
 This is insane!,,,,Monica,,
 What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re married everywhere.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s gonna break his heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore.",,,,Monica,,
 Yes I do!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.",,,,Monica,,
 Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!,,,,Monica,,
 What are you guys gonna do?,,,,Monica,,
" So, what do you think we should do?",,,,Monica,,
 I know I love you! (They hug.),,,,Monica,,
" That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!",,,,Monica,,
" All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don’t get married.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (They approach the craps table.),,,,Monica,,
 Ready?,,,,Monica,,
 (sarcastic) Come on eight.,,,,Monica,,
 Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight.,,,,Monica,,
 Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.,,,,Monica,,
 I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?,,,,Monica,,
" Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up to fate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandler and Monica standing side-by-side holding each other’s hands.)",,,,Monica,,
 That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.,,,,Monica,,
 He took my snack!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay! Oh God, y’know what? It’s really bad.",,,,Monica,,
" This doesn’t mean anything, does it?",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
" No, don’t say it! Don’t even think it!",,,,Monica,,
" I’m sick of the signs! It’s too fast, I’m happy the way things are!",,,,Monica,,
 I don’t want things to change! Do you?,,,,Monica,,
" All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it’s been three days and it’s driving me insane!",,,,Monica,,
 Then all your stuff would be here.,,,,Monica,,
" Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.",,,,Monica,,
 Live together? There have been no signs for that.,,,,Monica,,
 YES!!!!!!!!,,,,Monica,,
 Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!,,,,Monica,,
 Here’s your key (Gets him one.),,,,Monica,,
" Here’s your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!",,,,Monica,,
 Ready!,,,,Monica,,
 Wait! Oh my God! I can’t get out!,,,,Monica,,
" No, it’s not a sign! It’s a very old key!",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God it’s old!,,,,Monica,,
 I love you!,,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?",,,,Monica,,
" Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them. Okay? That’s it.",,,,Monica,,
 Pretty much.,,,,Monica,,
 Hi!,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, we have something to tell you.",,,,Monica,,
 Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey Pheebs!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, have you seen Rachel?",,,,Monica,,
 I have some pretty exciting news!,,,,Monica,,
 No! Chandler and I are moving in together!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, come here! (Phoebe joins them in the hug.)",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad? (Exits.)",,,,Monica,,
" Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!",,,,Monica,,
" I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she’s the only one left!",,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
" Have a seat. (They sit at the table.) Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.",,,,Monica,,
 Really?!,,,,Monica,,
" Yes, we are. (Chandler is frantically trying to get Monica to correct her.)",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, he’s gonna work on that.",,,,Monica,,
 (singing) We’ll be waiting for you…,,,,Monica,,
" Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!",,,,Monica,,
 I’m not your best friend?,,,,Monica,,
" All right, all right, at least I’m prepared.",,,,Monica,,
 (slapping his hand) Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 These aren’t for you! Are you upset?,,,,Monica,,
" Rach, there’s something uh, important I have to tell you.",,,,Monica,,
" No! But, I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.",,,,Monica,,
" Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn’t clear! I’m really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’s absolutely no rush.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. Don’t you want a cookie?,,,,Monica,,
" Maybe, do you need a tissue?",,,,Monica,,
 I made them!,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hi.,,,,Monica,,
" So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.",,,,Monica,,
" Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad. (Sits down, slightly disgusted.)",,,,Monica,,
" I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don’t I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!",,,,Monica,,
" Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.",,,,Monica,,
" Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey Rach, what about this? (She holds up a chrome 5-point star.) Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don’t know if I want it because it might be y’know, too many memories!",,,,Monica,,
" I don’t know. (Picks up a big plate from the coffee table.) Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.",,,,Monica,,
 Something to remember me by!,,,,Monica,,
" But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!",,,,Monica,,
" I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of era.",,,,Monica,,
" An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!",,,,Monica,,
 What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?! Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren’t you gonna miss me at all?!,,,,Monica,,
 What’s hard to believe?,,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.",,,,Monica,,
" No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, sweetie.",,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 I’m gonna miss you! (They hug.),,,,Monica,,
 I know!,,,,Monica,,
 Who’s Denise?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay listen, y’know when you move in Rachel’s room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.",,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.",,,,Monica,,
 I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,,,,Monica,,
 What do you have against the beautiful guest room?,,,,Monica,,
 Are you mocking me?,,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 Stop it Chandler. (Chandler is relieved) I’m sorry too.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah! Oh yes!,,,,Monica,,
" Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.",,,,Monica,,
 Totally!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh good.,,,,Monica,,
 Changes?,,,,Monica,,
 You’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together.",,,,Monica,,
 See now-now you’re taking them away from their home.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah-yeah, y’know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’t match! Where is it gonna go?!",,,,Monica,,
 Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!,,,,Monica,,
" Ross, we can handle this.",,,,Monica,,
 Love is the best medicine.,,,,Monica,,
 Why do you do it?,,,,Monica,,
 Yes.,,,,Monica,,
 That’s very funny!,,,,Monica,,
" Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, no, me neither.",,,,Monica,,
 You still want to move in together right?,,,,Monica,,
 Ross didn’t scare you?,,,,Monica,,
" Come here, I want to show you something!",,,,Monica,,
 This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it’s still walking distance to the kitchen.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay!,,,,Monica,,
 Uh-hmm.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! I love that!,,,,Monica,,
" Uh, no!!",,,,Monica,,
 This bottle opener. (She grabs it off of the freezer door.),,,,Monica,,
 And it’s a magnet!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey Rach, aren’t these candlesticks (holds up a pair) mine?",,,,Monica,,
" Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.",,,,Monica,,
 (under her breath) That you’re a liar. (Hides the candlesticks in a drawer.),,,,Monica,,
" Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe that’s crazy!,,,,Monica,,
 Hmm? (Rachel holds up the candlesticks.),,,,Monica,,
" No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.",,,,Monica,,
 I loved them!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 How’d the lecture go?,,,,Monica,,
 That you’re not funny or sexy?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch.",,,,Monica,,
 What the hell are you doing?!,,,,Monica,,
 (in an Irish accent) Monica Gellerrr. (She rolls her ‘R’),,,,Monica,,
" (normal voice) Oh, you can have an accent and I can’t?! (To an exiting student in accent.) Top ‘O the morning to ya laddies!",,,,Monica,,
 Gimme ‘em!,,,,Monica,,
 You stole them from me!,,,,Monica,,
 Gimme them!,,,,Monica,,
 You just wanna each take one?,,,,Monica,,
" Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.",,,,Monica,,
 I think you look fine.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, come on, do it one more time!",,,,Monica,,
 Yes!,,,,Monica,,
 You’re kidding!,,,,Monica,,
 Ross!,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!",,,,Monica,,
" Don’t worry about it Phoebe, we’ll absolutely do it.",,,,Monica,,
" Come on Chandler, come on! It’ll give us great practice for when—(realizes what she’s about to say and changes)—people with babies come to visit.",,,,Monica,,
" Pheebs, how’s it going?",,,,Monica,,
" Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.",,,,Monica,,
 What do you mean?,,,,Monica,,
 This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.",,,,Monica,,
" I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.",,,,Monica,,
 And six others.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that’s the same.",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone’s eye out!",,,,Monica,,
 Oh it’s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.,,,,Monica,,
 How are you still single?!,,,,Monica,,
 Good. What made you change your mind?,,,,Monica,,
" Damnit! Y’know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! (He does it again.)",,,,Monica,,
 And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing the clothes?,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, you know you don’t actually have one.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room.",,,,Monica,,
" The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for a while!",,,,Monica,,
" He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got to go to the hospital.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God.,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, what, what happened here?!",,,,Monica,,
 But my apartment!,,,,Monica,,
 But the mess!,,,,Monica,,
" You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out. ‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!",,,,Monica,,
 (entering from her room) Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 (thinks) Okay.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.",,,,Monica,,
 It’s not your birthday.,,,,Monica,,
 You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!,,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you’re packed.",,,,Monica,,
" (entering) Rachel, I need to borrow—You’re not packed!!!! You’re not packed even a little bit!",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" (grabs a bag of those Styrofoam peanuts) I’ll be coordinator! Oh my God! I’m so sorry, I didn’t get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can’t you Phoebe?",,,,Monica,,
 You’re plans were with us.,,,,Monica,,
" All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay! (To Rachel) Oh my God, thank you!!",,,,Monica,,
" (entering and interrupting the guy’s escape attempt) Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we’re gonna start with…",,,,Monica,,
 I thought you said you were going to do nothing.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay fine, now Ross…",,,,Monica,,
 Why not?,,,,Monica,,
" It’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?",,,,Monica,,
 Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!,,,,Monica,,
" All right, sorry. (Goes back to Rachel’s room.)",,,,Monica,,
 (starting to cry) Oh God!,,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 I’m gonna miss you so much.,,,,Monica,,
 I don’t think there’s anything.,,,,Monica,,
" Nope, she’s perfect.",,,,Monica,,
" Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.",,,,Monica,,
 Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.",,,,Monica,,
" Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Ross! (To Rachel) See? Other people call me!",,,,Monica,,
 (on phone) What’s up?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, put him on!",,,,Monica,,
" ""Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!""",,,,Monica,,
" ""Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!""",,,,Monica,,
 I’m not talking to her!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, maybe you’re right—She made fun of my phone pen!",,,,Monica,,
" Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about—What are you doing? (She sees that Rachel is unpacking.)",,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!,,,,Monica,,
 Because it’s my apartment!,,,,Monica,,
" How about, you’re moving!! (Grabs a bunch of clothes and throws them into a box. What follows is a brief sequence of Rachel unpacking and Monica packing the same stuff over and over again as Rachel chants ""No."" and Monica chants ""Yes."")",,,,Monica,,
 (entering) I am not!,,,,Monica,,
 No Phoebe I am mad!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, ""What were you thinking?""",,,,Monica,,
" Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.",,,,Monica,,
" Y’know she has 147,000 pairs of boots…",,,,Monica,,
 She lets you borrow them.,,,,Monica,,
" Do you wanna live outside?! Because it’s gettin’ cold! (To Phoebe) She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.",,,,Monica,,
" When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.",,,,Monica,,
" When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.",,,,Monica,,
" And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)",,,,Monica,,
 Kinda. (She hugs Phoebe and looks out the window. She moves closer to it to get a better look.) Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?,,,,Monica,,
 I’m really gonna miss you.,,,,Monica,,
 Thanks.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 Bye.,,,,Monica,,
 She really left.,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you.,,,,Monica,,
 Can I ask you a question?,,,,Monica,,
 What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.),,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" (jumps over a box) Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, So you can move them!",,,,Monica,,
 It's nice to meet you. Janine...?,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?",,,,Monica,,
" Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, so you like her too Chandler?",,,,Monica,,
" Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.",,,,Monica,,
" (chuckles) Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.",,,,Monica,,
" Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?",,,,Monica,,
" So, Phoebe runs weird huh?",,,,Monica,,
 Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.,,,,Monica,,
 I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.,,,,Monica,,
 We'll see.,,,,Monica,,
 (on phone) Hi!,,,,Monica,,
" Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.",,,,Monica,,
 It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.,,,,Monica,,
"  Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?",,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 Why is Ross naked?,,,,Monica,,
 Naked?,,,,Monica,,
 Is it the same thing that Chandler had?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!",,,,Monica,,
 Is it okay for me to come in now?,,,,Monica,,
 Why is everything different?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.",,,,Monica,,
" It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?",,,,Monica,,
" Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.",,,,Monica,,
 Of course!,,,,Monica,,
" All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. (Gets her cleaning gloves on) Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey guys.,,,,Monica,,
 It was okay. She’s still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
" No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.",,,,Monica,,
 I don’t think mine likes me either.,,,,Monica,,
 We should go.,,,,Monica,,
 What happened to your teeth.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, I think I shouldn’t look directly at them.",,,,Monica,,
" Ross they’re really, really, really white.",,,,Monica,,
 How much longer?,,,,Monica,,
 Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?,,,,Monica,,
 She will be after tonight.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my god.,,,,Monica,,
" My God, Rachel, I can’t believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I’m so jealous. (Chandler looks at her.)",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, please, come on. Look at him. (Pointing to a picture of Ralph on a magazine,.)",,,,Monica,,
" (Holding a shirt in front of Ross.) Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. (Ross has a big smile.) Nope. Okay, colors that don’t work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look so bright.",,,,Monica,,
" I’m just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.",,,,Monica,,
 Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.,,,,Monica,,
 Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.,,,,Monica,,
" All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.",,,,Monica,,
 Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.,,,,Monica,,
" Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.",,,,Monica,,
" You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right, I’m sorry.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.,,,,Monica,,
" When girls hang out, we don’t have pillow fights in our underwear. (Chandler gets a hurt look on his face.) I’m sorry. We do. We do. I don’t know why I said that.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.",,,,Monica,,
" (on phone) Okay, great!  Bye. (Hangs up as Chandler enters.) So guess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?",,,,Monica,,
" (not amused by Chandler’s joke) I miss Rachel. (To Chandler) No, my parents.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! (Quickly trying to change subjects), I was thinking we would eat around four.",,,,Monica,,
" Because they don’t know we’re dating. (Again, trying to quickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink and the stove to cook.)",,,,Monica,,
" Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn’t.",,,,Monica,,
" (trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I’ll see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living room.)",,,,Monica,,
" Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry.",,,,Monica,,
" Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.",,,,Monica,,
" Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’t care what they think. I’m sorry.",,,,Monica,,
 You really think that’ll work?,,,,Monica,,
 (hugging Chandler) I don’t think you’ll ever get my parents that drunk!,,,,Monica,,
 Nothing.,,,,Monica,,
" No, sweetie, I-I trust you.",,,,Monica,,
 You’re not gonna mess it up.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, it’s done about two minutes before it looks like that.",,,,Monica,,
 Whoa whoa whoa! Where’re you goin’?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?",,,,Monica,,
" You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you’re gonna eat here!",,,,Monica,,
" Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is it’s Chandler!",,,,Monica,,
" Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.",,,,Monica,,
" Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!",,,,Monica,,
" Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.",,,,Monica,,
 (shocked) What?,,,,Monica,,
 Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to Chandler) were trying to get Ross stoned!,,,,Monica,,
" Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!",,,,Monica,,
 You! It’s not like it’s a big deal! You-you don’t still do it or anything!,,,,Monica,,
" Dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you’re gonna put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the-",,,,Monica,,
" Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!",,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
" (faking joy. Rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time, like Joey said) Mmmm! It’s good!",,,,Monica,,
" It’s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who’s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.",,,,Monica,,
" (again, lying) I’m gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.",,,,Monica,,
 Ross? Let’s go.,,,,Monica,,
" Alright, you know what? That’s it. You’ve had your chance.",,,,Monica,,
" (out loud, to her parents) Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!",,,,Monica,,
" And Dad, y’know that mailman that you got fired? He didn’t steal your Playboys! Ross did!",,,,Monica,,
 Ross hasn’t worked at the museum for a year!,,,,Monica,,
 Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!,,,,Monica,,
" Well actually, I-I didn’t eat mine. It’s still in the bathroom.",,,,Monica,,
 Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It’s about being with the people that you love.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, here.",,,,Monica,,
" Aw, I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way.",,,,Monica,,
 Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!,,,,Monica,,
 We are there!,,,,Monica,,
 What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!,,,,Monica,,
 We are going to Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, here comes another camera.",,,,Monica,,
" If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They’ve been taping those people up there all day.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He’s the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.",,,,Monica,,
" Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren’t wearing underpants?",,,,Monica,,
" Man, this sucks! Y’know if Mom and Dad don’t see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who’s gonna be the losers then?",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Ross, we haven’t done the routine since middle school.",,,,Monica,,
 Was it really that good?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, let’s do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!",,,,Monica,,
 5 6 7 8!,,,,Monica,,
 Yes! (They run over to a platform),,,,Monica,,
" I know! Hey, you haven’t been practising the routine, have you?",,,,Monica,,
 Me too!,,,,Monica,,
" Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don’t wanna look stupid!",,,,Monica,,
" Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?",,,,Monica,,
" We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. (To Ross) Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!",,,,Monica,,
 What? We could do it!,,,,Monica,,
" I can do it, okay? Come on, let’s go. (She and Ross get up)",,,,Monica,,
 I can’t do it! (Ross falls into Monica’s room),,,,Monica,,
" Honey, we have been through this before!",,,,Monica,,
 You serious?!,,,,Monica,,
 Really?!,,,,Monica,,
 Bye. (Janine exits.),,,,Monica,,
 I am so glad you said cooks.,,,,Monica,,
 You got it from Pottery Barn?!,,,,Monica,,
" Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.",,,,Monica,,
" It’s gotta be one of a kind. Y’know like umm, y’know uh, what’s that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?",,,,Monica,,
 I’m telling—If you put that in her apartment you’ll never hear the end of it.,,,,Monica,,
" I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I’ll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, you don’t have too!",,,,Monica,,
 Tomorrow!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.,,,,Monica,,
 What happened to Janine?,,,,Monica,,
 Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!,,,,Monica,,
 (loudly) What?!! (Quietly) What?,,,,Monica,,
" Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!",,,,Monica,,
" Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.",,,,Monica,,
 (from the hallway) I do not like that woman!,,,,Monica,,
 I am loud!,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?",,,,Monica,,
 (loudly) I know!!!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, I’d like to but, (extremely quietly) I’m not sure we have time to go.",,,,Monica,,
 We owe you?!,,,,Monica,,
" We didn’t give you any money! (Chandler is motioning, ""No!"")",,,,Monica,,
 Don’t worry about it.,,,,Monica,,
 Absolutely!,,,,Monica,,
 Good night! (They go into their respective apartments.),,,,Monica,,
" (bursting in) I knew it!! Y’know, you’re not so quiet yourself, missy!",,,,Monica,,
 (steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Let’s go! Right now!,,,,Monica,,
 (to Janine) You’d better hope I don’t see you in the hallway!! (They exit.),,,,Monica,,
 What did I tell you about the hall?!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.",,,,Monica,,
" Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, I’m glad we worked things out.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Bye. (Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.),,,,Monica,,
 (hearing that) That’s it big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt with the garbage bag) Come on!,,,,Monica,,
 (chasing her) You’d better run!,,,,Monica,,
 I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.,,,,Monica,,
" That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us.",,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, you tell a lot of jokes!",,,,Monica,,
 (relieved) It’s only you.,,,,Monica,,
" So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a story?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?",,,,Monica,,
 Me neither.,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
" (visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.",,,,Monica,,
 It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.,,,,Monica,,
 That’s a good idea.,,,,Monica,,
 Do you know what’s a bad idea?,,,,Monica,,
 That’s right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hear something?,,,,Monica,,
 It’s coming from the living room.,,,,Monica,,
" (entering) Hey, you guys.",,,,Monica,,
" (laughing) Oh, don’t you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.",,,,Monica,,
" (laughing harder) Nothing, I’m just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. (To Phoebe) Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.",,,,Monica,,
 (angrily) It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn’t you pick me?,,,,Monica,,
" That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!",,,,Monica,,
" (to Phoebe) You start working on that list. (She grabs her coat and leaves, too.)",,,,Monica,,
 I know. Where do you wanna go eat?,,,,Monica,,
 I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there.,,,,Monica,,
 All right.,,,,Monica,,
" No, thank you.",,,,Monica,,
" Joey, what are you doing?",,,,Monica,,
" Joey, do you work here?",,,,Monica,,
" Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?",,,,Monica,,
" So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?",,,,Monica,,
 Hah!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance.",,,,Monica,,
 I am not high maintenance!,,,,Monica,,
 Why do I have to decide?,,,,Monica,,
 I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, Chandler, you go first.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?",,,,Monica,,
 Do you want me to pick you?!,,,,Monica,,
 Continue.,,,,Monica,,
" All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.",,,,Monica,,
" You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!",,,,Monica,,
" Hi, Chandler. There you are.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?",,,,Monica,,
" Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.",,,,Monica,,
" Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!",,,,Monica,,
 Ahhh! You are on my list.,,,,Monica,,
 (embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didn’t even tell him to say that. (They hug). All right you’re off my list.,,,,Monica,,
" (sits next to him) Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.",,,,Monica,,
" I pick you, Phoebe.",,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" (congested) Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can’t work if I’m sick.",,,,Monica,,
 I’m not sick!! I don’t get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!,,,,Monica,,
 (wiping her nose) I have not been sick in over three years! (Sneezes.),,,,Monica,,
 I don’t need a tissue! I’m fine-d!,,,,Monica,,
" I’m fine-d. I’m fine-d! Y’know, it’s a really hard word to say.",,,,Monica,,
 Rach? (Points to Jill.),,,,Monica,,
 You bought a boat?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let’s do something crazy!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I’ll rest. But y’know if I’m going to bed, then you’re coming with me.",,,,Monica,,
" (wiping her nose) Are you saying that you don’t wanna get with this? (Tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesn’t work all that well with the big robe.)",,,,Monica,,
 (in a sexy voice) Come on. (Coughs loudly.),,,,Monica,,
" I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have s*x with a sick person either, that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.",,,,Monica,,
 (still sick) Chandler!,,,,Monica,,
" (trying to be seductive) Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.",,,,Monica,,
 How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.,,,,Monica,,
" Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I’m not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel. (Sneezes.)",,,,Monica,,
" I’m fine. (She goes into one of those half sneezing, half-coughing fits that you get with a bad cold or flu.)",,,,Monica,,
" (entering) Chandler, I think I’m sick.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest? (She hands him some of that Vicks Vap-O-Rub to put on.)",,,,Monica,,
 Come on! I really need your help!,,,,Monica,,
" Fine, I’ll rub it on myself.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah?,,,,Monica,,
 Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?,,,,Monica,,
 I can’t believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?,,,,Monica,,
" Not now, I’m sick!",,,,Monica,,
 What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, if you really wanna have s*x…",,,,Monica,,
 Worked like a charm.,,,,Monica,,
 (calling from the bathroom) Is someone there?,,,,Monica,,
 (entering with Chandler) Who? (She looks out the window at Ross’s apartment) Is that your sister?,,,,Monica,,
" God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh no it’s not, no it’s not. It’s a first date. I’m sure that nothing is gonna…(as she is talking we see Ross close his drapes.)",,,,Monica,,
 Joey we know you steal our food.,,,,Monica,,
" (To Rachel) Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?",,,,Monica,,
 (crying) This is my favorite part.,,,,Monica,,
 Chandler there’s nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don’t have to be so macho all the time.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I’ve got it! I have got it! (Gets up and gets something from the dresser underneath the TV.) Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!",,,,Monica,,
 Where were your parents?,,,,Monica,,
 Poor thing!,,,,Monica,,
 You’re jealous of Princess Caroline?,,,,Monica,,
 (noticing the bag Joey’s carrying) Oh great! Did you get a movie?,,,,Monica,,
" Guys, what’s going on?",,,,Monica,,
 That’s Phoebe! Where did you get that?,,,,Monica,,
" This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y’know she had such a terrible childhood.",,,,Monica,,
" Yes, but you are dead inside.",,,,Monica,,
" Wh-what, why?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah you’re right, we can’t—we shouldn’t watch this.",,,,Monica,,
" (hands the tape back to Joey, but doesn’t let him grab it) Y’know maybe a little bit!",,,,Monica,,
 Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey sweetie!,,,,Monica,,
 (picking up the book) Chicken Soup for the Soul?,,,,Monica,,
 Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you can’t cry, I love you.",,,,Monica,,
 Stop it!,,,,Monica,,
" I won’t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here. (Points to her heart.)",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won’t matter to me.",,,,Monica,,
" And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you’re writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, ""I will always be with you,"" and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, I know you’ll be crying a river inside.",,,,Monica,,
 What is wrong with you?!!!,,,,Monica,,
" What?! You can’t shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!",,,,Monica,,
 No you robot!!,,,,Monica,,
" No, I haven’t.",,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) Shhhh!!!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! Are-are you crying?,,,,Monica,,
 Bye.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
 Why did they get divorced?,,,,Monica,,
" And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldn’t be dating me, that’s for sure.",,,,Monica,,
 He’s not boring! He’s just-he’s just low key.,,,,Monica,,
 Thanks.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh no! What’s the matter?,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Bye.,,,,Monica,,
" Maybe Joey doesn’t have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?",,,,Monica,,
" No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey Phoebe! Guess what?,,,,Monica,,
 Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" (gets up and gasps) Oh my God! Rachel!! (Rachel is stunned to see that her long lost friend is still fat.) (Monica goes over and gives Rachel a big bear hug, which is quite easy for her.) You look terrific!",,,,Monica,,
" You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we’ve seen each other?",,,,Monica,,
" Rach, he’s a friend of ours.",,,,Monica,,
 (getting up) Joey!,,,,Monica,,
" Ohhh! (Takes the plate.) No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.",,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 (laughs) You realize what you are don’t you?,,,,Monica,,
 You’re his bitch.,,,,Monica,,
 (panicked) Oh wait! You didn’t just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 Yes!!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
" Honey, having a heart attack is nature’s way of telling you to slow it down.",,,,Monica,,
 Let’s take a walk. (They start to leave.) Y’know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine! (They exit.),,,,Monica,,
 Sorry. So how’s it going with Joey?,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah! She’s right in there! (Points to Phoebe’s room.),,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! That’s great! Oh wow! (Hugs him.) You’re a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!,,,,Monica,,
 Wait a minute! (Quickly checks her pockets and pulls out…) My last Kit-Kat bar!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay!!,,,,Monica,,
 It’s not mayonnaise!!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!",,,,Monica,,
" Well, y’know it’s none of my business, but aren’t you married?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, you’re not.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah I can! (Laughs) And don’t think I don’t, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha! (Laughs.)",,,,Monica,,
" (giggles) Of course I have! What do you think, I’m some 30 year old virgin?",,,,Monica,,
" Say it louder, I don’t think the guy all the way in the back heard you!",,,,Monica,,
" It’s not like, I haven’t any opportunities. I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy. I’m seeing this guy Roger, all right? He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y’know, give him my flower.",,,,Monica,,
 Y’know what? You are right?!,,,,Monica,,
 Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on your husband!,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!",,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!,,,,Monica,,
 Put it out!!,,,,Monica,,
 (handing her a cup) Here you go sweetie.,,,,Monica,,
" But, I put some honey in it.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, you used to like playing the guitar.",,,,Monica,,
" I hope you’re hungry, we’re starting with oysters. And y’know what they say about oysters, don’t you?",,,,Monica,,
" No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.",,,,Monica,,
 People! People say it! Come here! (She grabs him and kisses him.),,,,Monica,,
" And then we’re gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.",,,,Monica,,
" No-no-no, no! It’s sensual!",,,,Monica,,
 Okay! (They kiss again and his beeper goes off.) Ohhh no!,,,,Monica,,
 I can’t promise anything. (She starts to dig in.),,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, me too.",,,,Monica,,
 Stop it!! That’s not funny!!,,,,Monica,,
" I’m sorry, okay? It just—tonight was supposed to be y’know, it was supposed to be a big deal.",,,,Monica,,
 You don’t want to know what tonight was.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, tonight was—was going to be my first time.",,,,Monica,,
 All right relax Mr. I’ve Had s*x Four Times!,,,,Monica,,
 How many?,,,,Monica,,
 I was just waiting for the perfect guy.,,,,Monica,,
 No. He’s not a horrible guy.,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, I’m gonna die a virgin!",,,,Monica,,
 Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?,,,,Monica,,
 I was kidding.,,,,Monica,,
 No! (They both laugh.) Oyster?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you’re horrible, how would I know?",,,,Monica,,
 It’s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!,,,,Monica,,
 Absolutely! It would just be one friend (Points at Chandler) helping out another friend. (Points at herself.),,,,Monica,,
 Noo!! Okay!!,,,,Monica,,
" Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?",,,,Monica,,
" I have no moves. (He moves in to kiss her and she laughs and backs away.) Okay, whatcha doin’ there?! (Giggles.) Oh y’know what? I’m sorry, this is just too weird.",,,,Monica,,
 What if I turn out the lights? (Runs to shut them off.),,,,Monica,,
 Chandler?,,,,Monica,,
 That’s the couch.,,,,Monica,,
" I know! I’ll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, check me out, I’m a slut!",,,,Monica,,
 Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.,,,,Monica,,
 Are you okay?,,,,Monica,,
" Great! It’s so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I’m all like, ""Can the doctor see me now?""",,,,Monica,,
" Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. (He laughs halfheartedly) Are you sure you’re okay?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.",,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 Why would you do that?,,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
 Chandler!,,,,Monica,,
" There was just one woman, wasn’t there?",,,,Monica,,
 Including me?,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, yeah.",,,,Monica,,
" Yes! Why, did you—you forget to make yours?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay. (They kiss.) Okay, I can’t wait! This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever! (Chandler giggles and exits.) I can’t believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!",,,,Monica,,
 I’m just so excited to make the presents! (Chandler does another sarcastic/scared laugh and leaves.) Shoot!,,,,Monica,,
" Sure! Okay, you go first.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay! (She takes her present for him and they move over to sit on the couch.),,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, you ready to open yours?",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that’s what this is about.",,,,Monica,,
" No! No, she doesn’t. Uh Phoebe, what she makes—that’s uh—they’re sock rabbits. They are completely different—Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn’t make it! I’m sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we’re supposed to make the presents!",,,,Monica,,
" No-no, it’s not okay! It’s not! I mean you were just… You’re so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y’know I’m just gonna—I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and I am going to do anything you want in there! (Points to the bedroom.)",,,,Monica,,
" Oops! (Covers its eyes.) Y’know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?",,,,Monica,,
 We have got to wash that! (Referring to the sock bunny.),,,,Monica,,
" Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?",,,,Monica,,
 I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!,,,,Monica,,
" Oop, your cake is ready!",,,,Monica,,
 Who the hell are you?!,,,,Monica,,
 The only problem!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.",,,,Monica,,
" I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.",,,,Monica,,
 The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?,,,,Monica,,
 You are just the sweetest. (They kiss.),,,,Monica,,
 (not buying it) Uh-huh.,,,,Monica,,
" (pointing to the kitchen) Yeah you will! (Points to the bedroom) And, are you kiddin’ me?!",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 I am!! (Enter her room and closes the door behind her.),,,,Monica,,
 It’s Chandler’s way of pretending he didn’t take mime.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.",,,,Monica,,
 You’re on the phone!,,,,Monica,,
 Come on! (The girls all run out and Joey holds up Chandler by smiling.),,,,Monica,,
" Oh well, it’s not so bad.",,,,Monica,,
 Joey! He’s working! (To Chandler) You would look good in that.,,,,Monica,,
 Isn’t that mine?,,,,Monica,,
" (pulling Rachel back down) Yes, they can stay with us.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Wow! So, now you’re going on a date with this girl?",,,,Monica,,
" You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s not like you’re y’know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.",,,,Monica,,
 You dated her!,,,,Monica,,
" All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!",,,,Monica,,
" Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?",,,,Monica,,
" I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.",,,,Monica,,
" So Rach! You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you’ll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y’know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.",,,,Monica,,
 Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!,,,,Monica,,
 Does that smell bother you?,,,,Monica,,
" Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie to cover it.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay!,,,,Monica,,
" Hello? (Listens) Oh yes, one minute please. (To Phoebe) It’s for you. It’s the fire inspector.",,,,Monica,,
 So it’s okay to date a student.,,,,Monica,,
" Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents.",,,,Monica,,
 Joey that is so sweet.,,,,Monica,,
 What?! You’re going out with her again!,,,,Monica,,
 Joey! You didn’t even know her!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey! How’s it goin’?,,,,Monica,,
 Yes it has! I made cookies!,,,,Monica,,
 But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven.,,,,Monica,,
" (pulling the plate back) Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘em in bed, remember? No crumbies!",,,,Monica,,
 Okay!,,,,Monica,,
 (opening the door) What are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
 What’s the charity?,,,,Monica,,
 Does Ralph mumble when you’re not paying attention?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I like Elizabeth.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y’know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.",,,,Monica,,
" Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 (laughs sarcastically) Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, uh y’know, our guy works with Chandler and he’s really nice and smart and he’s a great dresser!",,,,Monica,,
 You’re not supposed to look!,,,,Monica,,
" All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.",,,,Monica,,
 Our guy’s a great dancer!,,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) Do you want our guy to be your guy?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you’re doing frat guys.",,,,Monica,,
 And slept with the professor.,,,,Monica,,
 Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler’s work!,,,,Monica,,
" Uh, would you stop it with that already?!",,,,Monica,,
 Are you funny? Tell us a joke!,,,,Monica,,
" All right guys stop it. Rachel, we’re very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y’know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.",,,,Monica,,
 In 1981 you were 13!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 We’re really glad you decided to meet our guy.,,,,Monica,,
" You’re gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?",,,,Monica,,
" Eldad, this is Rachel.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! (They start to leave but run into Phoebe with her guy in tow.) (To Phoebe) What are you doing here?!,,,,Monica,,
 No! You can’t do that!,,,,Monica,,
 (stopping him) Sit down! We’re winning!,,,,Monica,,
 Rachel! Rachel! You haven’t touched Eldad’s hair!,,,,Monica,,
" That’s right Patrick, bye-bye!",,,,Monica,,
  What?,,,,Monica,,
 (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.,,,,Monica,,
  Yes.,,,,Monica,,
"  Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.",,,,Monica,,
"  Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.",,,,Monica,,
  That's your call.,,,,Monica,,
"  Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.",,,,Monica,,
  They'r alright.,,,,Monica,,
"  No really, they're OK.",,,,Monica,,
"  Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.",,,,Monica,,
  I'm outa here. [Monica leaves],,,,Monica,,
"  Well, what happened?",,,,Monica,,
  Was it...,,,,Monica,,
 (startled) Ahh! Aren’t you dressed yet?,,,,Monica,,
 We’re supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.,,,,Monica,,
 Wh?! What about my allergies?!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there? (Chandler has a disgusted look on his face.) Apparently you’re not very good at it! I…",,,,Monica,,
 Y’know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case… (Chandler gets that disgusted look back.) Okay…,,,,Monica,,
 You had no right to go out with him.,,,,Monica,,
 You sold me out.,,,,Monica,,
 Yes you did.  You absolutely sold me...,,,,Monica,,
 Did you just flick me?,,,,Monica,,
 Fine!,,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!,,,,Monica,,
 I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.,,,,Monica,,
 We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.,,,,Monica,,
 Ross!!,,,,Monica,,
 How crazy that we’d run into you!,,,,Monica,,
 (obviously attracted to him) Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?,,,,Monica,,
" Y’know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, ‘cause usually he’s got the children’s hospital.",,,,Monica,,
 And he’s a great brother!,,,,Monica,,
 Ohh!,,,,Monica,,
" No, you said the baby creeps you out.",,,,Monica,,
 You said the baby.,,,,Monica,,
 Why would the little girl creep you out?,,,,Monica,,
 What?! Excuse me!,,,,Monica,,
 How was your first day?,,,,Monica,,
" Well y’know Joey, you’re a pretty charming guy.",,,,Monica,,
" No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, stop writing about us!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I’ll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!",,,,Monica,,
 (writing on a piece of paper) Phyllis is sitting in a chair.,,,,Monica,,
 (still writing) Phyllis sees what I’m doing.,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.",,,,Monica,,
 We said six!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, ""Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!""",,,,Monica,,
 Ugh!,,,,Monica,,
 What time?,,,,Monica,,
 Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!,,,,Monica,,
 Hi!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh that’s great!,,,,Monica,,
 I mean think about all the money that you’re gonna make!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I love museums!",,,,Monica,,
 Soakin’ up all the culture.,,,,Monica,,
 Where do you want to start?,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah!,,,,Monica,,
" This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! (Points to both places.) I mean you’d have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch. (The arch at the entrance to the room.)",,,,Monica,,
 What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even engaged.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, that stuff is…",,,,Monica,,
" Hi, honey.",,,,Monica,,
" What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!",,,,Monica,,
 Oh no!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh please, he didn’t hear it! He didn’t hear it!!",,,,Monica,,
 NOOOO!!!!!!!!,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe!,,,,Monica,,
 Have you seen Chandler?!,,,,Monica,,
 The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! (Phoebe gasps.) I know! How bad is this?!,,,,Monica,,
 I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can’t find him anywhere!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, I’m never gonna listen to you again, that’s for sure! (Mimicking her.) ""Y’know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?""",,,,Monica,,
 Well Rachel’s not here! (Runs out.),,,,Monica,,
" (going over to him) I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that?",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel…",,,,Monica,,
" It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t.",,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
 I know! I know.,,,,Monica,,
 I’m gonna go tell Joey that (laughs) that you’re back. I was really worried about you. (Exits.),,,,Monica,,
 Still crying?,,,,Monica,,
" Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is s*x.",,,,Monica,,
" I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one. I’m just saying y’know, if we’re having s*x, he’s not gonna be talking.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, we have some…",,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 What’s the big deal?,,,,Monica,,
" Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?",,,,Monica,,
 Do you really see this as a long-term thing?,,,,Monica,,
 Hi guys.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, thank you! (The gang exhibits signs of quiet apprehension and wears knowing glances.) (Monica giggles.) What’s going on?",,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
 Are you okay?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah. I’m okay. I’m actually—I’m a little cold, can I have your jacket?",,,,Monica,,
 (laughs) Are you sure you’re okay?,,,,Monica,,
 Ohh that’s sweet!,,,,Monica,,
 (interrupting him) Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, Richard. (Yep, Richard’s back.)",,,,Monica,,
" Oh God, maybe he won’t see us. Richard!",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, it’s good to see you!",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah—Oh that’s right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, wh-why don’t we sit down?",,,,Monica,,
 (to Richard) It’s good to see you,,,,Monica,,
" And so, we’re hiding in the bathroom.",,,,Monica,,
 So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going at it right on the bathroom floor.,,,,Monica,,
 Ohh.,,,,Monica,,
 I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can’t get out of!",,,,Monica,,
 Why don’t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that’s what I did when I first (looks at Chandler and pauses) weighing stuff.,,,,Monica,,
 If the school finds out you’re fired.,,,,Monica,,
 She’s leaving for three months.,,,,Monica,,
" Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, ""Do you see a future?"" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? (Ross pauses in consideration.) Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn’t you?!",,,,Monica,,
 Okay well I think…that’s your answer.,,,,Monica,,
 Why do you want to see my hand?,,,,Monica,,
 (suspiciously) Okay. (Exits to carry out Phoebe’s wishes.),,,,Monica,,
 (entering) I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hi guys!,,,,Monica,,
 What are you up too?,,,,Monica,,
 Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet.,,,,Monica,,
 Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay well that’s good to know.,,,,Monica,,
" Sure, I love this part! (Starts to look busy.)",,,,Monica,,
 Richard!,,,,Monica,,
" Ohh… Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what’s up?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?",,,,Monica,,
 What uh—What did you—What?!,,,,Monica,,
 Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh God… (Starts looking around.) Why don’t they put chairs back here?!,,,,Monica,,
 What the… Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three years ago?!,,,,Monica,,
 What were you doing in Africa?,,,,Monica,,
" Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I… I’m sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.",,,,Monica,,
" Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I’m the one that’s making him wait!",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah!,,,,Monica,,
 Why? Because of the government.,,,,Monica,,
" So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t really believe that do you?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, but that’s pigs not people!",,,,Monica,,
 Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!,,,,Monica,,
 Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!,,,,Monica,,
 Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, it’s great.",,,,Monica,,
 I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in a dead-end relationship!,,,,Monica,,
" It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just that I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time!",,,,Monica,,
 No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s like something’s changed.,,,,Monica,,
 I didn’t change!,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 Is that some kind of boat talk?,,,,Monica,,
 What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around for nothing?,,,,Monica,,
 (starts for the door) Well there’s some people who do want to marry me.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah! Richard!,,,,Monica,,
 That’s right.,,,,Monica,,
 You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!,,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 I don’t know why I’m here.,,,,Monica,,
 I don’t know.,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Chandler is such an idiot!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I’ll have a scotch…",,,,Monica,,
 (moving over to the couch) Still smoking cigars?,,,,Monica,,
" No that’s, that’s okay.",,,,Monica,,
" Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new eye doctor.,,,,Monica,,
 Edward Nevski?,,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 But getting over was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.,,,,Monica,,
" (to the mask) I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!",,,,Monica,,
 Oh! (Laughs and points at the mask.) Him.,,,,Monica,,
" I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up’s apartment! Y’know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!",,,,Monica,,
" Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig s*x over lunch, I don’t want that!",,,,Monica,,
" Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!",,,,Monica,,
 Nothing. (She backs away a little bit but is still in his arms and looks up at his eyes.) I don’t kn—Umm. I don’t know. Umm…,,,,Monica,,
" Y’know, I-I… I have to figure…some st—Y’know, some stuff before I can…",,,,Monica,,
 You wanted it to be a surprise.,,,,Monica,,
 Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky. (Starting to cry.) As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!,,,,Monica,,
 Yes.,,,,Monica,,
 I knew you were likely to take a wife!,,,,Monica,,
" Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.) We’re engaged!!!",,,,Monica,,
 Oh…,,,,Monica,,
 (yelling at the top of her lungs) I’m engaged!!!!!! I’m engaged!!!!,,,,Monica,,
" I’m getting married!!!! I’m gonna be a bride!!!! (Someone else yells at her.) No, I will not shut up because I’m engaged! (He yells again.) Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don’t you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancée will kick your ass! (Chandler starts to look worried.) Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! (Bangs on her class with a spoon to make a toast.) Okay, umm, I just wanna say that…I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. (Chandler clears his throat.) Our special night. I mean it just wouldn’t be my—our-our night, if you all weren’t here to celebrate with me—us—Damnit!",,,,Monica,,
" Awww, come on—wait—stop it. Okay, to Monica.",,,,Monica,,
 Y’know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay everybody, let’s go! Let’s go!",,,,Monica,,
 (looking at her hand) Y’know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! (Sees Chandler sitting on the bed.) You’re not getting dressed. (Chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.),,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, but I don’t think we have time.",,,,Monica,,
 (lustily) Let’s do it! (She kisses him and they fall back onto the bed.),,,,Monica,,
" (chasing after him) Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it!",,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe!,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe! Come on! Let’s go! (Knocks on her door.) Come on! (Phoebe enters with guitar and not ready to go.) Why aren’t you dressed yet?!,,,,Monica,,
" (grabs the guitar away from her) No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding.",,,,Monica,,
" Fair enough, now go get ready!",,,,Monica,,
" I’ll get everybody else (Does so), finally we can start celebrating my—(She gasps and is stopped by the sight of Ross and Rachel making out in the hall.) I’m sorry, uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past.",,,,Monica,,
" (interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?",,,,Monica,,
" See, I’ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I’m only planning on doing this once. So, uh y’know, maybe this is selfish and I’m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.",,,,Monica,,
 No it’s not! No! No! Now it’s about you and Ross getting back together!,,,,Monica,,
" See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!",,,,Monica,,
 That’s true.,,,,Monica,,
 Thunder being stolen!!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, we’re still talking about it, aren’t we?",,,,Monica,,
 Yes that would be lovely.,,,,Monica,,
" Y’know what? I-I think that umm, I don’t feel like going to The Plaza.",,,,Monica,,
" No-no, I-I really don’t want to talk about it! I don’t! (To Rachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)",,,,Monica,,
" I can’t believe her, y’know it’s just—it’s so typical.",,,,Monica,,
 Paris?,,,,Monica,,
 Keep talking.,,,,Monica,,
 I love you!,,,,Monica,,
" (in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur.",,,,Monica,,
" (opening the door) Hi Pheebs, what’s up? (She enters.)",,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 Yes.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, let’s just say it’s not the first time you’ve stolen my thunder.",,,,Monica,,
" My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.",,,,Monica,,
 It’s all everybody at the party could talk about!,,,,Monica,,
 (gasps) We had a caricaturist!,,,,Monica,,
" And yet, here we are doing it again.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!,,,,Monica,,
 I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, is that why you did it in the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!",,,,Monica,,
" I don’t know! I don’t—maybe you’re feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’t stand the fact that your formerly fat friend is getting married before you!",,,,Monica,,
 (yelling after them) I can’t believe you’re gonna have s*x on my engagement night!!,,,,Monica,,
" (outside the door) It’s Monica, open up!",,,,Monica,,
" I just wanted to say that I hope you do have s*x tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I’m going to announce that I’m pregnant!",,,,Monica,,
 I know why!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay! Why?!,,,,Monica,,
 What do you mean?,,,,Monica,,
 (starting to cry) I’m sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. (They hug.),,,,Monica,,
 (entering from her room) Oww!,,,,Monica,,
" I don’t know, my hand feels weird. I guess it’s because, I’m engaged! (Shows off the ring.) How long before it starts getting annoying?",,,,Monica,,
 Okay! (Runs off.),,,,Monica,,
" (returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3"" 3-ring binder on the table.)",,,,Monica,,
" This baby has got everything. Take y’know, locations for instance. (She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, so I haven’t cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.",,,,Monica,,
" All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.",,,,Monica,,
" A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.",,,,Monica,,
" Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!",,,,Monica,,
 Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah! Roses or Lilies? (Holds up a picture of each.),,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! It’s like one mind.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh dad, really you don’t need to…",,,,Monica,,
" Well, at least you’re not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.",,,,Monica,,
" Anyway, we’re really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we’ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. (She and Chandler laugh, but her parents don’t.) What?",,,,Monica,,
 What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don’t you?,,,,Monica,,
 I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!,,,,Monica,,
 You bought the beach house when I was 23!,,,,Monica,,
 What about when I started dating Chandler?,,,,Monica,,
 I can’t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!,,,,Monica,,
 I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?,,,,Monica,,
 My parents spent the money for our wedding!,,,,Monica,,
 No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,,,,Monica,,
 How? I don’t have any money.,,,,Monica,,
 How much?,,,,Monica,,
 Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!,,,,Monica,,
 It’s enough for wedding scenario eight.,,,,Monica,,
" (To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!",,,,Monica,,
 This is the most special day of our lives.,,,,Monica,,
" Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we’re only gonna get married once.",,,,Monica,,
 You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.",,,,Monica,,
" Eh, you work for that.",,,,Monica,,
 You do?!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you’re so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?",,,,Monica,,
 You thought about that?,,,,Monica,,
 How many kids were we gonna have?,,,,Monica,,
 What else did you think about?,,,,Monica,,
" (laughs) Y’know what? I-I don’t want a big, fancy wedding.",,,,Monica,,
" No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.",,,,Monica,,
 Uh-hmm.,,,,Monica,,
" I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin’ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh good.,,,,Monica,,
" Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah!,,,,Monica,,
" Of course! (She mouths, ""I have no idea,"" to the rest of the gang.)",,,,Monica,,
" (interrupts him) If someone wants to give us a present, we don’t want to deprive them of that joy.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I already have one.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, I know what I want!",,,,Monica,,
" No, you don’t want this. I want to have your grandmother’s cookie recipe.",,,,Monica,,
" Uh-huh, yeah.",,,,Monica,,
 I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. I’m gonna be the mom that makes the world’s best chocolate chip cookies.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Wow! That’s great! Dad must really like you, he doesn’t ask just anyone to play.",,,,Monica,,
" This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.",,,,Monica,,
 He hates to lose.,,,,Monica,,
 What’s wrong Phoebe?,,,,Monica,,
 No!! Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!,,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) This is what happens when you don’t register for gifts!,,,,Monica,,
 No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah! I bet I can do it.,,,,Monica,,
" All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.",,,,Monica,,
" You don’t? (Laughs) Well, that’s the difference between a professional and a layman.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey! How was sailing?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey! How was it?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God Chandler! I can’t believe it!,,,,Monica,,
 You gave my father a lap dance!,,,,Monica,,
" Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years!",,,,Monica,,
 I wasn’t escaping.,,,,Monica,,
 I was trying to help out a squirrel.,,,,Monica,,
" (takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens) I’m sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, I’ll call you later dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, here’s batch 22. Oh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.",,,,Monica,,
" No, just a Friday night.",,,,Monica,,
 The ones we had right after you almost threw up.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, I’ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I’m not gonna be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? Wouldn’t they have the recipe?",,,,Monica,,
 What was her name?,,,,Monica,,
 Nestle Tollhouse?!,,,,Monica,,
" (grabbing a bag of Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chips) Phoebe, is this the recipe? (Tosses her the bag.)",,,,Monica,,
 I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!,,,,Monica,,
" (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Hold on please. Joey, it’s your mom. (Hands him the phone.)",,,,Monica,,
 Wh-what are we gonna tell him?,,,,Monica,,
 And I have costumes.,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?",,,,Monica,,
 Still get a discount on wedding dresses?,,,,Monica,,
 I’m so happy for you!,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 Oooh!,,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) Hey sweetie.,,,,Monica,,
 I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.,,,,Monica,,
 Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.,,,,Monica,,
" Really? Okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?",,,,Monica,,
" If you tell me, I’ll tell you what Phoebe said.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God. He threw up?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired.",,,,Monica,,
 That’s right! You lose sucker!! (Pause) Please still marry me.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey! Good, you’re home!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey baby. (Kisses him.),,,,Monica,,
 I made you a surprise.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I’ve had such a craving for them.",,,,Monica,,
 Ross!,,,,Monica,,
 No! No. They’re umm… They’re just uh…ground beef smileys. (Holding up one of the shells.),,,,Monica,,
 Excuse me Mr. Mexico.,,,,Monica,,
 (trying not to laugh) I’m not laughing.,,,,Monica,,
" You’re right. I mean I’m sorry. Yeah, I shouldn’t be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! (Runs off laughing which gets Chandler laughing.)",,,,Monica,,
 (running up to Ross) What happened in Atlantic City?!,,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! (Laughing),,,,Monica,,
 I-I already told him everything! (Threateningly) You shush!!,,,,Monica,,
 Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!,,,,Monica,,
 It’s hard for some people!,,,,Monica,,
 Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!,,,,Monica,,
" Ohh, I’m sorry I couldn’t think of any more for Ross!",,,,Monica,,
" Y’know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.",,,,Monica,,
 No!,,,,Monica,,
 I don’t know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! (Ross laughs.) What are you laughing at Pampers? (He stops laughing and glares at her.),,,,Monica,,
 Yeah?,,,,Monica,,
" Ohh, absolutely.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, definitely!",,,,Monica,,
" Then, I’d steer clear of Phoebe.",,,,Monica,,
 What’s the matter?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, my mom called, they’re gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we’re looking for a good picture of us.",,,,Monica,,
" That’s not true, there are great pictures of us!",,,,Monica,,
" (looking at one) Oh, here’s a great one.",,,,Monica,,
" I know, but look at me: all tan.",,,,Monica,,
 That’s a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y’know… (Does the whole hair blowing in the wind model type poses.),,,,Monica,,
 Chandler what do you say?,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah! (They turn to the camera, and Chandler does The Face again.) All right, maybe you don’t have to smile. Let’s try something else. Let’s try umm, try looking sexy.",,,,Monica,,
 Or not.,,,,Monica,,
" I know. Let’s try a look…of far off…wonderment. Okay, we’ll-we’ll gaze into our future and we’ll think about our marriage and the days to come. (Chandler is still not getting it.) Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say ""Geller and Bing to be married,"" not ""Local woman saves drowning moron!"" (The photographer laughs.) Hey! Don’t laugh at him! He’s my drowning moron!",,,,Monica,,
 That’s it! Take it! Take it! Take it!,,,,Monica,,
" They can’t all be bad. (To Chandler) Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.",,,,Monica,,
 Do you really want to pull at that thread?,,,,Monica,,
 (seeing him approach) Hey! There you are!,,,,Monica,,
 Are you okay?,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, what were you thinking?",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (She opens it up and shows it to them.),,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, we really do!",,,,Monica,,
 Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.",,,,Monica,,
" First of all um, I love you both so much and you’re both so important to me…",,,,Monica,,
" Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine…",,,,Monica,,
 If Phoebe were my maid of honor…,,,,Monica,,
" Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.",,,,Monica,,
" (laughs) Well that’s the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!",,,,Monica,,
 Because then I don’t have to!,,,,Monica,,
 I’m really not deciding!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah that’s right.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today when I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck.",,,,Monica,,
" No, it’s more like a (sarcastically) good luck.",,,,Monica,,
" She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.",,,,Monica,,
" Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?",,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God yes! Who is she?,,,,Monica,,
 Did you break up with her?,,,,Monica,,
 Why?,,,,Monica,,
 Fat?!,,,,Monica,,
 You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, apparently she does.",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who you are!,,,,Monica,,
 You’re Lewis Posin.,,,,Monica,,
" Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?",,,,Monica,,
" No! But because he thought I was too faaaaa…. (Chandler emerges, without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.",,,,Monica,,
" No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.",,,,Monica,,
 It’s pretty clear.,,,,Monica,,
 Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.,,,,Monica,,
" All right, I…I have to ask.",,,,Monica,,
 Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?",,,,Monica,,
 In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s not the point.,,,,Monica,,
" Well… That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.",,,,Monica,,
 How?,,,,Monica,,
" What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different. I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are!",,,,Monica,,
 Keep going.,,,,Monica,,
 Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?,,,,Monica,,
 I love you. (They hug and kiss.),,,,Monica,,
" (entering) Hey, what’s going on?",,,,Monica,,
" (gasps) Ohh, wow! That’s great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we’ll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I’m so excited! (Runs out leaving Rachel completely stunned and Phoebe laughing.)",,,,Monica,,
 She sent the chicken back again?!,,,,Monica,,
 Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!,,,,Monica,,
" (to the lobster) Lucky b*st*rd! (Throws the lobster in and turns around to face the planet’s most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford of course. She’s the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice.",,,,Monica,,
 I’m fine.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh… Uh…,,,,Monica,,
" Well, she saw the ring.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, she actually has a boyfriend y’know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.",,,,Monica,,
 Huh?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, she cornered me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!",,,,Monica,,
 Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won’t be so bad.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, she’s not gonna like the chicken that night either, is she?!",,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
 So-so you would’ve just lied?,,,,Monica,,
 Would it really have been that easy?,,,,Monica,,
" Good, so do it Saturday night because we’re going to dinner with her and Clark.",,,,Monica,,
 He might still show up.,,,,Monica,,
 Is that all?,,,,Monica,,
 It’s actually going to be just family.,,,,Monica,,
 What are we gonna do?,,,,Monica,,
" Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?",,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren’t they?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.",,,,Monica,,
 We’ll just…we’ll just let her stay.,,,,Monica,,
 Kinda like your barcalounger.,,,,Monica,,
 I never stop thinking about it.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!,,,,Monica,,
 Because Chandler still has feelings for you!,,,,Monica,,
 That’s right. That’s right. And that is why you can’t stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding.,,,,Monica,,
" I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.",,,,Monica,,
" It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.",,,,Monica,,
" Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (That’s true in so many ways, trust me, I’ve lived in one and been to the other.)",,,,Monica,,
 'Cause you invited your assistant.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.,,,,Monica,,
" Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, (Laughs) but I still do.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!",,,,Monica,,
" (entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know that your oven doesn't work?",,,,Monica,,
" Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket),,,,Monica,,
 Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?,,,,Monica,,
 That's my pie!,,,,Monica,,
 Uh-oh! Uh-oh!,,,,Monica,,
" We left Joey alone with the food! (Walks towards the window and looks out) Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!",,,,Monica,,
 Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monica’s apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.,,,,Monica,,
 I'll be right there!,,,,Monica,,
" (walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!",,,,Monica,,
" Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?",,,,Monica,,
 Don't do what?,,,,Monica,,
1250,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 Really? I'd say 3 to 4.,,,,Monica,,
" When it's your assistant, I would say never.",,,,Monica,,
" Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he’s obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.   What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.",,,,Monica,,
 Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back to Clunkers again) Oooh, I can't leave her!",,,,Monica,,
 That's not gonna work.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey! I didn't know either.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I knew.",,,,Monica,,
" Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!",,,,Monica,,
" Hi, honey.",,,,Monica,,
" What? Why, why would...",,,,Monica,,
" That's right, she came back all by herself.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and…it bent.",,,,Monica,,
 Did the girl ever let you ride it?,,,,Monica,,
 Making holiday candy for the neighbors.,,,,Monica,,
 I’m gonna hang this basket (Points to the one sitting on the table) on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.,,,,Monica,,
 See? This is exactly why I’m making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.,,,,Monica,,
 Where you can make out with your assistant.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh yeah, what’s the plan?",,,,Monica,,
 Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!,,,,Monica,,
 Did you two…,,,,Monica,,
" Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire…",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
" The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!",,,,Monica,,
 Joey!!,,,,Monica,,
 Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!,,,,Monica,,
 They love my candy? Oh man!!! I’ve gotta go make more!! (Starts to do so.),,,,Monica,,
 Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!,,,,Monica,,
 (turning a light on) Who is that?!,,,,Monica,,
 Hi. Do you know what time it is?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh please! (To Chandler) Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.,,,,Monica,,
" Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning.",,,,Monica,,
 Um-hmm.,,,,Monica,,
" Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh yeah! I saw her walkin’ it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.",,,,Monica,,
" Umm, can we see you ride it?",,,,Monica,,
" See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And there is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. (To Chandler) Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!",,,,Monica,,
" I’m sorry, I can’t help you. See? (Points to her new sign.) Rules are rules.",,,,Monica,,
" No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell ‘em?",,,,Monica,,
" Some people have been saying its y’know little drops of heaven, but whatever.",,,,Monica,,
" (still talking to the woman) All right, I’ll do it just this once! But you can’t tell anybody!",,,,Monica,,
 (closing the door) It’s unbelievable! I-I can’t believe that sign didn’t work!,,,,Monica,,
 Hmm?,,,,Monica,,
 But they like it!,,,,Monica,,
 Maybe.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man? (Joey laughs but stops when Chandler turns to glare at him.)",,,,Monica,,
" Well, they’re just gonna have to wait aren’t they? I’ve only got two hands!!",,,,Monica,,
 No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing with the system!,,,,Monica,,
" (opening the door and frantically) Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!",,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) Thank you.,,,,Monica,,
 Did you smoke?,,,,Monica,,
" I’m fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.",,,,Monica,,
 Betrothed… (Corrects him),,,,Monica,,
 (Offering Ross the skull) Licorice?,,,,Monica,,
 Are you gonna dress up as Santa?,,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 About a half an hour.,,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 Bing's weird.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.",,,,Monica,,
" I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.",,,,Monica,,
 (pulling Chandler away from the Maitre d') You need to give him money.,,,,Monica,,
" No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin’ you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.",,,,Monica,,
 You've got to be smooth about it.,,,,Monica,,
 How did it go?,,,,Monica,,
" It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!",,,,Monica,,
 I don't know.,,,,Monica,,
 We'd be eating our soup right now.,,,,Monica,,
" (sees two people exit) Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!",,,,Monica,,
" It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!"" I mean, it is so annoying.",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?",,,,Monica,,
" What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?",,,,Monica,,
" Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from…Texas.",,,,Monica,,
 Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?,,,,Monica,,
 Come on Ben.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.",,,,Monica,,
" (to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)",,,,Monica,,
" Yes, is that okay?",,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 What are you talking about?,,,,Monica,,
 You were invited?!,,,,Monica,,
" My God, I can’t believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y’know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn’t have stopped her, there probably wouldn’t even be a wedding to go to.",,,,Monica,,
" Joey, that paper’s like a year old!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
 Limited seating?! (Screechingly) I am just one tiny person!,,,,Monica,,
" (disgusted) Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That’s not the reason she’s not inviting me!",,,,Monica,,
 Joan?,,,,Monica,,
" Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn’t invited and you got ""and guest?!""",,,,Monica,,
" Wait a minute, y’know, you’re bringing me!",,,,Monica,,
 Why not?!,,,,Monica,,
" Because! She’s my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We’re family y’know? Well that’s important to me.",,,,Monica,,
 (laughs) We’ll see.,,,,Monica,,
 David who?,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?",,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
 So! He’ll understand!,,,,Monica,,
" God, you are so strong.",,,,Monica,,
 Limited seating my ass. Let’s see who made the cut. (To the couple sitting to her right.) Hi!,,,,Monica,,
 I’m Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?,,,,Monica,,
 Used to work with her. Used to! I’m a relative and I didn’t get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!,,,,Monica,,
" (to the couple on her left) So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, you’re fine.",,,,Monica,,
" Here’s Frannie. Hmm, won’t she be happy to see me? (Starts to get up and greet Frannie.)",,,,Monica,,
 Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.,,,,Monica,,
 Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!,,,,Monica,,
" You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What—Why wouldn’t you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! (Frannie’s husband walks up.) Stuart!",,,,Monica,,
 Oh wait I forgot my wrap.,,,,Monica,,
" (looking up) Ross, when’s this comet thing start?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, we’ve been out here for two hours and we haven’t seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler’s getting chilly. (She walks over to where Chandler is bundled up in a big coat and shivering.)",,,,Monica,,
 She’s sleeping.,,,,Monica,,
" Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what’s going to happen to you if you wake me up.",,,,Monica,,
 It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.,,,,Monica,,
 With a wok? (Chandler’s holding a wok.) I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.,,,,Monica,,
" Here, let me make the milk, I’m up anyway.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay that does sound like fun.,,,,Monica,,
 The second sister dies?!,,,,Monica,,
 The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, here’s your milk. What do you want to talk about? (She sees that Chandler has fallen asleep and slams the door loudly to wake him up.)",,,,Monica,,
 Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I’m sorry. Here. (Hands the mug of milk to him.),,,,Monica,,
 Are you still awake?,,,,Monica,,
" You do know that was me who just said that right? (He doesn’t respond and she turns on the light, waking him.) Hey. As long as we’re both up…",,,,Monica,,
 What?! What are you doing?!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. We-we had s*x and then we fell asleep.,,,,Monica,,
" Nooo! No, that’s not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world! (She turns out the light to go back to sleep.)",,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay. Okay, I’m ready. Come on big fella!",,,,Monica,,
 Give me the good stuff.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I’m up! I’m up!",,,,Monica,,
 That really was some of your best work.,,,,Monica,,
 I have to be up in seven minutes.,,,,Monica,,
 Really?!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I’ll get the furniture polish!,,,,Monica,,
" (entering, carrying a newspaper) Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section…",,,,Monica,,
 Look at this. (Hands him the newspaper.),,,,Monica,,
 I can’t believe mom and dad are selling the house!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it’s time the velvet ropes came down.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria’s Secret catalogues, not a gym!",,,,Monica,,
 As much as they love you?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 That was me and Ross.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh that’s a great idea. You’re really good on the phone.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see everything again! All of the memories…",,,,Monica,,
 I used to love to play restaurant.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies! (She goes to the attic.)",,,,Monica,,
 Hey guys! Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.",,,,Monica,,
" (wary) Okay. So, which boxes are mine?",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (Starting to go through them) Oh! A coloring book! (Holding it up.),,,,Monica,,
 (looking through it) Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.,,,,Monica,,
" (holding up a glove) Oh, an old glove?",,,,Monica,,
" Wow! Look at this! (Picking up a shirt.) I can’t believe I even fit into this shirt! (She holds it up and it reads: Tyrannosaurus Ross.) (She turns it around and looks at it.) Oh, this is yours. (Hands it to Ross.)",,,,Monica,,
" (holding up a small cowboy hat) This isn’t mine. (Sets it down and looks at the rest of the boxes.) Hey, this isn’t, this isn’t my stuff! Ugh, Ross! (Grabs and holds up a doll.) These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Just mine?,,,,Monica,,
 So why-why wasn’t Ross’s stuff ruined? (Pause) And if you say the words medical marvel I’m going to Easy Bake your head!,,,,Monica,,
" So wait, Ross’s stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!",,,,Monica,,
 I can’t believe this! (Storms out.),,,,Monica,,
" Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. (She picks up some kind of furry thing.) It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don’t even know what it is! Ohh, it’s still soft. (She rubs it against her cheek.) What do you think this is?",,,,Monica,,
 How do you think I am?! You’ve wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!,,,,Monica,,
 (opening it) What’s this?,,,,Monica,,
 (shocked) What?!,,,,Monica,,
" Wait, you’re giving me your Porsche, you’re kidding me right?!",,,,Monica,,
 All right!,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hey guys!,,,,Monica,,
 Do you guys know what happened to Chandler’s barca lounger?,,,,Monica,,
 Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger’s gone?! This is the best day ever! (Runs out.),,,,Monica,,
 Happy birthday!!!,,,,Monica,,
 It’s your birthday!,,,,Monica,,
 Chocolate-chip pancakes!,,,,Monica,,
 They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.,,,,Monica,,
" Rach, you’re in a great place in your life. Come on, you’ve got a great job! Good friends…",,,,Monica,,
" Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.",,,,Monica,,
 I can’t believe you bought this.,,,,Monica,,
" All right Rach, for what it’s worth, I think that you’re doing great. I mean y’know let’s face it, no one handles this well.",,,,Monica,,
 Weren’t you asked to leave sonny?,,,,Monica,,
 Heyyy!! You got the door open!! (Giggles.),,,,Monica,,
" Nooo! (Giggles) Okay. (She tries to pull herself up by Rachel and Joey’s doorknob, but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment. She manages to catch herself.) Whoa! (Stands up, unsteadily) Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning (whispering) thirty. (Giggles.) So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. (Pause) I wanna puke on you later!",,,,Monica,,
 Noo!!!,,,,Monica,,
 Noo!!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! (Pause) That they know of.,,,,Monica,,
 Really?! You promise?,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. I love you so much. (Kisses him.),,,,Monica,,
 What about your breath?! (Breathes on him.),,,,Monica,,
 Okay. I can do that.,,,,Monica,,
" Ross, just forget about it. This guy’s got you totally wedged in.",,,,Monica,,
 Yay!,,,,Monica,,
 (sees someone) Paul!,,,,Monica,,
 Phil!,,,,Monica,,
 Awwwww… (Giggles.),,,,Monica,,
 All you had to do was buy the card!,,,,Monica,,
" Really! That long?! (Chandler slowly turns and looks at her.) (To Chandler) Look all you want, it’s happening!",,,,Monica,,
" You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now! (Growls and pulls him into a kiss.)",,,,Monica,,
 I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends…,,,,Monica,,
" I really like to say that I’m-um… (Pause) Y’know what I’d really like to say? I’m drunk!! (Mrs. Geller pulls the camera down.) That’s right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! (Ross grabs the camera out of his dad’s hands.) And guess what! I’ve been drunk before! And I’ve smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It’s all okay. It’s okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up. (Falls over sideways with Ross filming the fall.)",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?",,,,Monica,,
 Oh man!,,,,Monica,,
 He’s gonna eat the cake!,,,,Monica,,
" I’m glad you’re here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.",,,,Monica,,
" Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.",,,,Monica,,
 Do you mind telling us what it is?,,,,Monica,,
 What is DOOL?,,,,Monica,,
 Who are they killing off?,,,,Monica,,
 She’s my favorite character on DOOL.,,,,Monica,,
 And the way she slaps all the time!,,,,Monica,,
 Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?! (Raises her hand towards Chandler.),,,,Monica,,
 What is that?,,,,Monica,,
 It sounds like it’s coming from across the street.,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Nooo!!,,,,Monica,,
" No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! (She looks through the window and sees Ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes.) Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!",,,,Monica,,
" He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It’s not even a song!",,,,Monica,,
 Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are.,,,,Monica,,
 No! No-no they’re not. They’re still very angry! But y’know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.,,,,Monica,,
 (interrupting) You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!,,,,Monica,,
" (entering with Rachel) Oh my God! It’s true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?",,,,Monica,,
 Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?! (Points to her cheek.),,,,Monica,,
" (breaks away) Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! (To Cecilia) Umm, you’re a stupid bitch.",,,,Monica,,
 Nice to meet you! My God you’re great!,,,,Monica,,
 What about the second minister we met with? I kinda liked him.,,,,Monica,,
 Come on! It wasn’t that bad!,,,,Monica,,
" All right, what about the third guy?",,,,Monica,,
 Can you blame him?,,,,Monica,,
 Well then we still have a problem.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, we’re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they’re all either boring or annoying or y’know, can’t stop staring at the ladies. (Points to her chest.)",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, we’re getting married, married; not sixth grade married.",,,,Monica,,
 Are you serious?,,,,Monica,,
 We’re never gonna find anybody.,,,,Monica,,
 Joey look it’s really sweet…,,,,Monica,,
 That is true.,,,,Monica,,
 It might be kinda cool.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey Pheebs, how’s it going?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I’m sorry. Can I get you something?",,,,Monica,,
" Here, take a couple of these. (She gets up to grab a couple of pills.)",,,,Monica,,
 It’s Hexadrin.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, while we’re waiting for these pills to kick in, I’m gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. (Phoebe gets up and goes with her.) Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I’m gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I’m—Sit down—(She sits down on the couch)—gonna make you some tea. And then, I’m gonna rub your feet.",,,,Monica,,
 Hexadrin. (She gets the box out of her purse.),,,,Monica,,
" No Phoebe, those are like the side effects and stuff.",,,,Monica,,
" Y’know, the possible side effects.",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!",,,,Monica,,
 In case it happens.,,,,Monica,,
 You did it! You got ordained?!,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, your liver is right here. (She points to the right side of her torso.)",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah!,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!",,,,Monica,,
 How about receiving?,,,,Monica,,
 It doesn’t say that!,,,,Monica,,
 There you go!,,,,Monica,,
" No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy thought that I was Ross’s mom.",,,,Monica,,
" And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much…",,,,Monica,,
 (standing outside) Cute PJ’s! You’re really livin’ it up here in London huh?,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Is Joey here?,,,,Monica,,
 Wouldn’t you be?,,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, not anymore.",,,,Monica,,
" I know, I just thought it would be fun.",,,,Monica,,
 Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay!,,,,Monica,,
 (breaking the kiss) Y’know what’s weird?,,,,Monica,,
 This doesn’t feel weird!,,,,Monica,,
 You’re a really good kisser.,,,,Monica,,
 Hm-hmm!,,,,Monica,,
 Wow! You are really fast!,,,,Monica,,
 We’re gonna see each other naked.,,,,Monica,,
 Do you wanna do it at the same time?,,,,Monica,,
 One!,,,,Monica,,
 Two!,,,,Monica,,
" Eh, we weren’t that close anyway!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, can we change the topic? Because it’s really doing nothing for me.",,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, fine but please don’t be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted…just s*x. So, when I…went to your room that night…I was actually looking…for Joey. (Joey smiles.)",,,,Monica,,
" No, because it-it didn’t seem important.",,,,Monica,,
 Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I fell in love with!,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!",,,,Monica,,
" Wait Chandler come on, let’s—it’s not a big deal!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey-hey.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah baby! (Phoebe and Joey nod.),,,,Monica,,
 Honey! Dinner’s ready!,,,,Monica,,
 Your favorite!,,,,Monica,,
 Yep! And lot’s of it!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, in we go.",,,,Monica,,
 So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.,,,,Monica,,
 Chandler.,,,,Monica,,
 I will.,,,,Monica,,
" No, I’ll do it. You just stick to your job.",,,,Monica,,
 There were only twelve.,,,,Monica,,
 What are peanut butter fingers?!,,,,Monica,,
" This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can’t believe I found it!",,,,Monica,,
" Well I’m Monica Geller, ball like a baby.",,,,Monica,,
 Have you found your dress yet?,,,,Monica,,
" No, I can’t afford this either. No. I-I-I’m, I’m just here to figure out which one I want then I’m gonna get it at Kleinman’s, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh May 15th.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah!,,,,Monica,,
 Jeffery.,,,,Monica,,
 The best man? Wow!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you’re looking for! (Holds up a picture of it.) Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? (She passes out whistles to them.) Three short blasts. When you hear it, come running.",,,,Monica,,
 All right.,,,,Monica,,
 (To Rachel) Hey! Don’t be a baby!,,,,Monica,,
" No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. (Checks another rack and another woman tries to reach around her.) (To the woman) Don’t crowd me! (Finds it) This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it’s perfect! (She takes it off of the rack and someone has a hold of it on the other side of the rack and tugs on it.) I’m sorry, this one’s taken! (The other woman tugs harder pulling Monica through the rack.) Whoa!",,,,Monica,,
 Megan!,,,,Monica,,
 You came?!,,,,Monica,,
 This is my dress!,,,,Monica,,
 Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!,,,,Monica,,
 What? You freak! You wouldn’t even have known about this place if it wasn’t for me!,,,,Monica,,
 Maybe I do! I’m pretty feisty! (She blows the signal.),,,,Monica,,
 (handing Phoebe the dress) Go! Go! Go!,,,,Monica,,
 NOW!!!!!!!! (Rachel runs off and Monica gets up to follow her.),,,,Monica,,
 Oh…,,,,Monica,,
 Hello? (Listens) What?! (Listens) You what?! (Listens) Hey you listen here missy! (Listens) Wh—(She is hung up on.),,,,Monica,,
 That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn’t have them back unless I gave her the dress!,,,,Monica,,
 What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh…Chandler wants the band. What do I do?,,,,Monica,,
 How?,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, he’s gotta be in the room for that to work.",,,,Monica,,
" Well umm, we were just talking about the y’know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y’know, they were the right way to go.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh crap!,,,,Monica,,
 (from the bedroom) Don’t come in here!,,,,Monica,,
 No! We only mess around at his place!,,,,Monica,,
" No, I’m wearing a wedding dress.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah but I’m not keeping it.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can’t like it.",,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh because it doesn’t…really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay! But you can’t rip it. Well, maybe a little.",,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? (They ignore her.) Guys?,,,,Monica,,
" Alright, what’s going on?",,,,Monica,,
 I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone. (She heads for the bedroom.),,,,Monica,,
 Joey!,,,,Monica,,
 Congratulations! Wow! I can’t believe you’re nominated for an Emmy!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh Soap Opera Digest award!,,,,Monica,,
 Honey? Is that something you’re making up?,,,,Monica,,
" (to Joey) Okay, I’ll go!",,,,Monica,,
" Really? (Looks.) My God, he’s really cute.",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, I’m engaged!",,,,Monica,,
" Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I’m engaged. (Points to her ring.)",,,,Monica,,
 Well you should be embarrassed. (Leaves.),,,,Monica,,
 Hey! How’d your date go with Jake?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly.",,,,Monica,,
 And did he?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again am I?",,,,Monica,,
" No, a guy would be saying, ""I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."" Oh my God! I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I’d be giving up! I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again.",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, it’s okay. You don’t have to tip toe around me. I-I’ve been thinking about it and umm, y’know what? I’m okay about not having that new relationship feeling…",,,,Monica,,
" See? That’s what I mean. I mean that, that’s great! But I wouldn’t trade in what I have for that. I mean I’m gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that’s what makes me happy. (Chandler approaches.) Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don’t you think?",,,,Monica,,
 Have you seen Chandler?,,,,Monica,,
 ‘Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I’m not gonna have and it’s freaking me out. I don’t know what to do about it.,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe! Come on I’m serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.,,,,Monica,,
 Why?,,,,Monica,,
 You gotta help me out here Pheebs.,,,,Monica,,
 So I’m not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with?,,,,Monica,,
 Your mother told you this?,,,,Monica,,
 The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?,,,,Monica,,
" Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?",,,,Monica,,
 You’re wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?,,,,Monica,,
 Doesn’t it ever just freak you out that-that you’re never gonna be with anybody new again?,,,,Monica,,
" Just, I love you so much. Just…It’s just sometimes it bothers me that I’m never gonna have that feeling. Y’know when you meet someone for the first time and it’s new and exciting? Y’know that rush?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, but all right you’re a guy, does it not freak you that you’re never gonna sleep with anybody else?",,,,Monica,,
 Even with me?,,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" Come here! Come here! (They hug.) Sweetie you don’t have to worry. No, besides y’know what? I’m gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid…",,,,Monica,,
 What was it for?,,,,Monica,,
 Wow!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. But a part of me also can’t wait ‘til it’s over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have s*x again until the wedding.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?",,,,Monica,,
" I gotta make up the guest bedroom. (To Ross) Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us for a few days.",,,,Monica,,
 Uh-hmm.,,,,Monica,,
" Ross, she’s 25 years old.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 Subtle guys!,,,,Monica,,
 I know you’re planning my surprise bridal shower.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. Sorry. (She goes into the guest bedroom.),,,,Monica,,
 Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?,,,,Monica,,
 That’s what you say about p0rn.,,,,Monica,,
" No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on!",,,,Monica,,
" Plus, everyone’s gonna see your thing. (Giggles.)",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh boy, me too!",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah?,,,,Monica,,
" The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay. (They both jump up to head for their room, but Monica stops.) But wait, we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to have lunch.",,,,Monica,,
 Shrill?! The wedding is back on!,,,,Monica,,
" So, are you ready to go?",,,,Monica,,
 (catching him) Chandler!,,,,Monica,,
 (To Ross) Cassie needs to stay at your place.,,,,Monica,,
 Because Purvy Perverson over here can’t stop staring at her.,,,,Monica,,
 You were staring about eight inches south of there.,,,,Monica,,
 She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.,,,,Monica,,
 Wafer thin ice!,,,,Monica,,
 So to get this part you can’t be?,,,,Monica,,
 But you are?,,,,Monica,,
 But you told them you weren’t?,,,,Monica,,
 Wow! Wow! And it’s definitely all gone? There’s nothing there to work with? (Joey glares at her.) What were you thinking?,,,,Monica,,
 Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to…grow a turtleneck!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!",,,,Monica,,
 Unless!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.",,,,Monica,,
" Well I’m not sure yet, but umm, off the top of my head I’m thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.",,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Well uh, I’m trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay. (Opens the fridge.) All right, turkey. Eh, that won’t work. Cheese? (Picks it up) That won’t work. Olive loaf? (Picks it up) I hope that won’t work.",,,,Monica,,
" No it’s umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I’m gonna go guys.",,,,Monica,,
 I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present! (Runs out.),,,,Monica,,
" Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. (Points to it.) Umm, this one is made of bologna. (Points.)",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, just until the glue dries.",,,,Monica,,
" (to a whole group) Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay? (To a different group) Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it’s gonna shrink.",,,,Monica,,
" I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that’s really just for me. (Rubs it against her cheek.) Okay. So, why don’t you go into your room and try these on and we’ll see—get a better idea of what’s gonna work.",,,,Monica,,
 Toothpick?,,,,Monica,,
 What are you trying on now?,,,,Monica,,
 And?,,,,Monica,,
 Joey!,,,,Monica,,
 What?! Which one?!,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe! Rachel! It’s Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! (She bursts into the apartment to find only Phoebe and Rachel sitting on the couch.) Oh.,,,,Monica,,
 For what?,,,,Monica,,
 You al-you already had it?,,,,Monica,,
" Well no, wait a minute, that’s not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.",,,,Monica,,
" Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents (Motions to the pile in the corner) without having to talk to people I don’t even like!",,,,Monica,,
" Wait a minute, she isn’t… She’s not the one who you…",,,,Monica,,
 Wow!,,,,Monica,,
 (To Joey) They were lovers.,,,,Monica,,
" (telling Chandler the seating arrangement) Okay, so this is where the band is. (Points.) And this is where the bar is. (Points) And all these pins have people’s names on them. (She has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) And Rach, here you are. (Points to Rachel’s place.)",,,,Monica,,
" (To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, relax it’s not a contest. (To Rachel) Certainly not a close one.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I think that’s it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they’re having fun don’t they?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh! (Gets up) Let’s see, well…if this is the wedding hall then umm (Walks away) you’re parents will be at home in Queens.",,,,Monica,,
 Why would they think they’re invited?,,,,Monica,,
 Joey!,,,,Monica,,
 Ross’s parents are my parents!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh please, you just want more blue pins.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!",,,,Monica,,
" Hey. Oh good-good you’re here! All right, I figured it out. I’m gonna take two tables of eight, I’m gonna add your parents, and I’m gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!",,,,Monica,,
 (looking at him) What?!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh that’s too bad. It’s true, but too bad.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh Joey!,,,,Monica,,
 No she hasn’t.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, what am I going to say?",,,,Monica,,
" (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? (Listens) Hi, this is Monica Geller. (Listens) Yeah I’m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren’t delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! (Listens) What, are they Irish?! (Joey gives her a thumbs up.)",,,,Monica,,
" Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.",,,,Monica,,
 What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!,,,,Monica,,
 007 has a fancy car!,,,,Monica,,
 007 gets all the ladies.,,,,Monica,,
 How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I’ll make you a nice martini.,,,,Monica,,
 How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
 The show?!,,,,Monica,,
 Have you ever been to one of my weddings?,,,,Monica,,
 The wedding starts at six.,,,,Monica,,
 You’ll vamp?!,,,,Monica,,
 You just carry that around?,,,,Monica,,
 Between you and…,,,,Monica,,
 A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.,,,,Monica,,
" All right that’s it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom to stand at the altar and scream racial slurs? I don’t care!",,,,Monica,,
 (defeated) Oh.,,,,Monica,,
 Do you realize that four weeks from today we’re getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!,,,,Monica,,
 There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?,,,,Monica,,
" Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.",,,,Monica,,
 No! But I know exactly what I’m going to say.,,,,Monica,,
" (handing him a pad of paper and a pen) Let’s just do it right now. Okay? It won’t be hard. Just say what’s in your heart. (She goes back, sits down, and starts feverishly writing.)",,,,Monica,,
 You have to help me! I’m supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this! (Shows them what she’s been working on.),,,,Monica,,
 Thank you.,,,,Monica,,
 Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. (Points.),,,,Monica,,
 Ennnh.,,,,Monica,,
" Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!",,,,Monica,,
" Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out there’s more than three), five, six, and seven!",,,,Monica,,
 It’s kind of an important one!,,,,Monica,,
" All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…(mouths 7)! (They both lean back on the couch satisfied.)",,,,Monica,,
 No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh yeah? When?,,,,Monica,,
 Why won't I be married when I'm 40?,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?",,,,Monica,,
 What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriageable about me?,,,,Monica,,
 Well?,,,,Monica,,
 (Comes up for below the covers and looks concerned.) Do you think he knew I was here? (Chandler quickly looks at Monica not knowing what to say.),,,,Monica,,
" Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)",,,,Monica,,
" Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)",,,,Monica,,
 I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.),,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 You said you loved me! I can't believe this!,,,,Monica,,
" Yes, you did!",,,,Monica,,
 You love me!,,,,Monica,,
 Then all your stuff would be here.,,,,Monica,,
" Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.",,,,Monica,,
 You wanted it to be a surprise.,,,,Monica,,
 Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky. (Starting to cry.) As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!,,,,Monica,,
 Yes.,,,,Monica,,
" Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.) We’re engaged!!!",,,,Monica,,
 Chicken? I could eat some chicken.,,,,Monica,,
" Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!",,,,Monica,,
" Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.",,,,Monica,,
 (on phone) I can't wait to be with you!  I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.,,,,Monica,,
" (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…",,,,Monica,,
 Bye!,,,,Monica,,
" Actually, I did!",,,,Monica,,
" Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!",,,,Monica,,
 Them?! Who's them?,,,,Monica,,
 Joey!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But, see, they don't know that we know that they know! So…",,,,Monica,,
 She's bluffing!,,,,Monica,,
" You go back out there, and you seduce her till she cracks!",,,,Monica,,
 Of course.,,,,Monica,,
" I love you too, Chandler. (They kiss.)",,,,Monica,,
" Well actually, Ross doesn't.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.",,,,Monica,,
" Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, you guys!",,,,Monica,,
 Oh that’s so sweet.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I don’t hear Chandler’s and he doesn’t hear mine.",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler!!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, well he’s my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.",,,,Monica,,
 Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you’re done.,,,,Monica,,
" Nice work everybody! So much for the y’know, ""You can drive it, but don’t tell Rachel"" plan!",,,,Monica,,
" Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won’t let you drive the Porsche is because you’re a terrible driver. There! That wasn’t about the wedding.",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler! He’s your father; he should be at the wedding.,,,,Monica,,
 Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!,,,,Monica,,
 So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I don’t care.,,,,Monica,,
 Here! (She sets a bag down in front of him.),,,,Monica,,
 It’s your suitcase. We’re going to Las Vegas.,,,,Monica,,
" We’re going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It’s time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.",,,,Monica,,
" No you didn’t. Oh and honey, just so you know, now that you’re marrying me, you don’t get to win anymore.",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That’s a, that’s a pretty great dad.",,,,Monica,,
 Who’s Mr. Garibaldi?,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it’s time that you let that stuff go. If your father’s not at your wedding…you’re gonna regret it for the rest of your life.",,,,Monica,,
 Yes!,,,,Monica,,
 How much did ever really win before?,,,,Monica,,
" Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did. (To Chandler) She? (To the waiter) I’m-I’m sorry I’m new. I don’t…",,,,Monica,,
 I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.,,,,Monica,,
 Why not?!,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 That can’t be your father.,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Relax! You’ll be fine. (Chandler exhales and turns off the table light.) Oh much better. You’re invisible now.,,,,Monica,,
" Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter—Uh, tress!",,,,Monica,,
 I’m-I’m Monica.,,,,Monica,,
 New York.,,,,Monica,,
 (looks at Chandler) In…in two weeks.,,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) You okay?,,,,Monica,,
 Do you realize this is probably the last time we’ll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?,,,,Monica,,
 Old?,,,,Monica,,
 That’s much better.,,,,Monica,,
" We’re gonna pick up the wedding dress, then we’re gonna have lunch with mom. (Joey stands up.)",,,,Monica,,
" I’m making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, so far I have uh, my bridesmaids' dresses won’t get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don’t have my something blue.",,,,Monica,,
 I had to go with the odds Rach.,,,,Monica,,
 That other play?,,,,Monica,,
 Wait! Wait! Wait! You can’t start today! Today’s the rehearsal dinner!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh. Well then way to go, you big movie star!",,,,Monica,,
 Who did we fight in World War I?,,,,Monica,,
" Honey, we gotta go!",,,,Monica,,
" (laughs) I don’t have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we’ll be getting married?",,,,Monica,,
" I just, I can’t believe that we made it!",,,,Monica,,
 I’m sorry but…nothing.,,,,Monica,,
 Well…honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to.. to flip you out.,,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" Ohh, I’m so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it’s really, it’s made me stay calm. (Chandler just looks at her.) I coulda been worse!",,,,Monica,,
" (voice on answering machine) Hi! If you’re calling before Saturday, you’ve reached Monica and Chandler. But if you’re calling after Saturday, you’ve reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!",,,,Monica,,
" Hey Maureen! (They hug.) Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.",,,,Monica,,
 What is that?,,,,Monica,,
" Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.",,,,Monica,,
" Dad! There’s Ross (points), why don’t you go talk to him?",,,,Monica,,
 Hi Mr.…Bing.,,,,Monica,,
 It-it’s so great to see you both here.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would you talk to Chandler’s dad and try to keep him away from Chandler’s mom?",,,,Monica,,
 He is the man in the black dress.,,,,Monica,,
" All right, I’m gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?",,,,Monica,,
 Who wants it? Anybody?,,,,Monica,,
" Nobody wants to do it? All right, I’ll do it myself.",,,,Monica,,
" Y’know what? You’re right, I’m sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. Sorry. (Monica goes into the bathroom.),,,,Monica,,
" (entering from her room, excitedly) I’m getting married today!!! (She trips and falls.) (Getting up) I think I just cracked a rib. But I don’t care because today’s my wedding day! My day is finally here!! (Runs back into her room.)",,,,Monica,,
 (re-entering) I’m gonna start getting ready! (Goes back into her room.),,,,Monica,,
" Hey! Okay, so I thought we’d start with my make up and then do my hair.",,,,Monica,,
 About what?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?",,,,Monica,,
 Any woman would be lucky to have ya.,,,,Monica,,
 (jumping up) Rachel! You okay?,,,,Monica,,
" (interrupting) The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I’m sorry! I have to start getting ready! I’m getting married today!",,,,Monica,,
" (getting up) I’m gonna go put my make-up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour! (Starts for the bathroom.)",,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 I can’t go to lunch!!,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) What’s going on?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, you’re-you’re really freaking me out.",,,,Monica,,
" How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh wow! Okay. Don’t scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, ""Oh my God! The worst has happened!""",,,,Monica,,
 I wanna wear this everyday.,,,,Monica,,
 (starting to cry) I’m so happy for me.,,,,Monica,,
" I know! Hey, how’s Chandler doin’?",,,,Monica,,
 Are you okay?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, you’re-you’re sweating.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh that’s sweet. Don’t touch me.,,,,Monica,,
 She’s right there.,,,,Monica,,
 Not now.,,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) Who is this?,,,,Monica,,
 (To Rachel) He took off?,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, for so long I…I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And instead, I found everything that I’d ever been looking for my whole life. And now…here we are…with our future before us…and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don’t want to. You go!",,,,Monica,,
 I do.,,,,Monica,,
 What baby?,,,,Monica,,
 We have a baby?,,,,Monica,,
 I didn’t take a pregnancy test.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Guys! I’m not pregnant.,,,,Monica,,
 You didn’t tell anybody I was did you?!,,,,Monica,,
" (To Joey) Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.",,,,Monica,,
 Find some! Please! Anything that doesn’t say I-I died tragically in France. (Joey leaves to find clothes.),,,,Monica,,
 Because I’m not.,,,,Monica,,
 What are you talking about?,,,,Monica,,
 Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! (Flash) Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah!,,,,Monica,,
 Why?!,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, I’m going to put my hand in your pocket!",,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh that is so sweet!,,,,Monica,,
 Yes.,,,,Monica,,
 What’s the matter?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, are you going to be able to do this?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, the good news is, I don’t think anyone’s looking at us.",,,,Monica,,
 (seeing him) Oh sweet Lord.,,,,Monica,,
" Honey, I’m not even going to pretend I was listening. (Sees someone else.) Hey! Hey! (Goes over to that person.)",,,,Monica,,
 Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!,,,,Monica,,
 This is so huge.,,,,Monica,,
 Of course not nothing is. Between me and you…,,,,Monica,,
 …in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?,,,,Monica,,
 How?,,,,Monica,,
" Well I-I talked to and uh, she’s definitely going to have this baby. Y’know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.",,,,Monica,,
 Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it’s gonna be.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, there’s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?",,,,Monica,,
 Are you okay?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh really?!,,,,Monica,,
 (interrupting) Rachel’s really the one who’s pregnant.,,,,Monica,,
 How do you feel?,,,,Monica,,
 Yes! Maybe it’s a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?,,,,Monica,,
" You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, wait a minute! Who’s is the father?!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, come on it’s my wedding! That can be my present.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?",,,,Monica,,
" Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you’ll be fine. (She starts to walk towards the floor.)",,,,Monica,,
" Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn’t matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Just try not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a move.) There you go.",,,,Monica,,
" (entering) Did I miss it? (Phoebe nods no.) Rachel, I-I want you to know that, if it’s positive, we’re gonna…",,,,Monica,,
 Go ahead Rach.,,,,Monica,,
" Well… Well, great.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh God…,,,,Monica,,
 Are you really gonna do this?,,,,Monica,,
" (depressed) That’s right. I’m no longer a bride. I’ll never be a bride again. Now, I’m just someone’s wife!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh yeah, right. (Rolls her eyes.)",,,,Monica,,
 That’s not ‘til Thursday.,,,,Monica,,
 They won’t be ready for weeks.,,,,Monica,,
 That’s true! (Happily) I knew I married you for a reason!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh thanks. (Reading the bill) Champagne, strawberries…Oh my God! I can’t believe Chandler ordered p0rn on our wedding night!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" No! (Pause) But, they’re callin’ out to me! I mean this little guy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn’t mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?",,,,Monica,,
 A tiny salt shaker!!!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.,,,,Monica,,
" Good. Okay, I’m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.",,,,Monica,,
" Whew. Although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean… I guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?",,,,Monica,,
 Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.),,,,Monica,,
" Hey, how are you feelin’? Any morning sickness?",,,,Monica,,
 No! Joey and Ross don’t know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe’s pregnant.,,,,Monica,,
" Wow. Y’know it is so weird. I mean, you’re gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what’s gonna happen.",,,,Monica,,
 What was that bam?,,,,Monica,,
 Who’s David Lynn?,,,,Monica,,
" No! No! I shouldn’t have even opened these! I mean I—Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?",,,,Monica,,
 Give me one more.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! Joey!,,,,Monica,,
 You can’t marry him!,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe!,,,,Monica,,
 She’s not pregnant. It’s Rachel. Rachel’s the one who’s pregnant.,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn’t have a baby in nine months!,,,,Monica,,
 There’s a dude?,,,,Monica,,
 People have got to finish their stories!,,,,Monica,,
 (throwing up the last present) I don’t know how any of these got opened?!,,,,Monica,,
" I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. What is that?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey! How’d it go?,,,,Monica,,
 So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 Great! We’re hangin’ in the kitchen! (She drags him into the kitchen and turns his back to the living room) Let’s stay in the kitchen!,,,,Monica,,
 Wow! That is a great picture!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! (Throws them into his chest.),,,,Monica,,
 That would be a good idea.,,,,Monica,,
 You kissed another woman!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay! (They high-five and he walks out.),,,,Monica,,
 Yeah I am!,,,,Monica,,
 That’s right. Get it out of your system while we’re alone.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn’t find though was your Speedo.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you.,,,,Monica,,
 This is so great! And I’m gonna be your baby’s aunt!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, but I’m the only one related by blood.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, what were you gonna say?",,,,Monica,,
 Hey! Good luck!,,,,Monica,,
" Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.",,,,Monica,,
 I didn’t think you could keep it a secret.,,,,Monica,,
 They’re kissing let’s just go around them.,,,,Monica,,
 I’m in love too! But in an orderly fashion.,,,,Monica,,
" (to the couple) Hi! Can you do that and walk? ‘Cause she said, ""Next.""",,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let’s act like we’re on our honeymoon.,,,,Monica,,
 Grab my ass!,,,,Monica,,
" Hi, sorry. I almost didn’t hear you, because y’know I’m just so in love with my new husband. We’re on our honeymoon.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh no, you see we’re on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?",,,,Monica,,
" You see, if we’d gone around them like I said, we—She would’ve given us those tickets. Damnit!",,,,Monica,,
 Look at that! Look at that! They’re going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?,,,,Monica,,
 Me neither! We have to get in! (She runs through the door with Chandler in tow.),,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! Oranges!,,,,Monica,,
 Fine. (Starts to walk away then she runs over and grabs an orange before she exits.) Go! Go! Go!,,,,Monica,,
 I can’t believe we’re here.,,,,Monica,,
 What? (Monica sees the first couple and gasps.),,,,Monica,,
 No!! You have been screwing us all day!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!,,,,Monica,,
 What? Are you serious?! (To Chandler) Joey smells gas!,,,,Monica,,
 Well do something! Get in there!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah! Do that!,,,,Monica,,
 No! (Pause) Are you doing it?! I don’t hear anything! Come on!,,,,Monica,,
 You’re really sticking with the shell necklace huh? (Points to necklace of shells he’s wearing.),,,,Monica,,
 Hi sweetie!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the way back.",,,,Monica,,
" No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.",,,,Monica,,
 I know.,,,,Monica,,
 This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.,,,,Monica,,
 We didn’t get anything for anyone.,,,,Monica,,
 That you can have.,,,,Monica,,
 It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you’re having a baby!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh great! (Shows them the picture.),,,,Monica,,
" All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y’know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?",,,,Monica,,
 Do you still wanna call ‘em? I wanna call ‘em.,,,,Monica,,
 (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Eighth street deli?,,,,Monica,,
" (on phone) Uh sorry, wrong number. (Hangs up)",,,,Monica,,
 (on phone) Hello? (Listens) (To All) It’s the deli again!,,,,Monica,,
 (hangs up) I don’t think this number’s right!,,,,Monica,,
 What?! People don’t do that!,,,,Monica,,
 They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?,,,,Monica,,
" And you’ve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, definitely.",,,,Monica,,
 I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give out fake names.",,,,Monica,,
" I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.",,,,Monica,,
 (rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey and Phoebe laugh.),,,,Monica,,
 What about my questions?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?",,,,Monica,,
 Hell yeah!!!,,,,Monica,,
 (taking Rachel’s hand) Sweetie okay. It’s okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I’m fine.,,,,Monica,,
 I know.,,,,Monica,,
 You used the Europe story!,,,,Monica,,
" (on phone) Hello Greg? (Listens) Hi, this is Monica from the plane? Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5… (Listens) (To Chandler) That is their old number! Jenny’s been giving it out since they moved!",,,,Monica,,
" (on phone) Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together? Say next Saturday? (Listens) Okay, how about Sunday? (Listens) Okay umm, the week after that? (Listens) The week after that? (Listens) Y’know what Greg? Y’know what? We are good, interesting, funny people with good questions and if you and your precious Jenny can’t see that then… (Listens) January 15th? (Chandler dances.) We’ll see you then! (Listens) Okay!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! Now go-go-go! (Phoebe enters) Hey Phoebe!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey how was dinner?!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay!,,,,Monica,,
" Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?",,,,Monica,,
" All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, all right! Let’s just cut to the chase, okay? (To Phoebe) You’re single. (To Tim) You’re single. (To Phoebe) He gets off work at eleven. (To Tim) She’ll be waiting for your call. (To Phoebe) I’ll give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! (Everyone in the kitchen stops.) I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.",,,,Monica,,
 Hi!,,,,Monica,,
 I…I have to fire him.,,,,Monica,,
" Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!",,,,Monica,,
" Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.",,,,Monica,,
" (thinks about it) All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!",,,,Monica,,
 I paid to have this done.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!",,,,Monica,,
" No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, ""Ha-ha! Gotcha!""",,,,Monica,,
 Why not?!,,,,Monica,,
 What?! You said he was sweet!,,,,Monica,,
 Just don’t pick up your phone.,,,,Monica,,
 What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it!",,,,Monica,,
 What do you mean?,,,,Monica,,
 I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my pleasure. Okay, I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news. (Phoebe enters.) Phoebe!",,,,Monica,,
 (simultaneously) You’re fired!,,,,Monica,,
 You’re fired.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah and-and I’m sorry too. But, well I just—I like things done a certain way and the chemistry’s just not right.",,,,Monica,,
 Tim wait!,,,,Monica,,
" Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there’s a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey you guys?,,,,Monica,,
" I know it’s last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.",,,,Monica,,
 And everybody has to wear costumes. (And there’s general disconcertment.) Come on! It’ll be fun!,,,,Monica,,
 You have to!,,,,Monica,,
" So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?",,,,Monica,,
 Wait! You’re supposed to wear a costume!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh.,,,,Monica,,
" I’m Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you’re too big for it.",,,,Monica,,
 So we do Supergirl.,,,,Monica,,
 What?! I thought he’d love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.",,,,Monica,,
 You didn’t dress up either?!,,,,Monica,,
 What?! There’s only been like four kids.,,,,Monica,,
 What are you supposed to be?,,,,Monica,,
" No, space doody!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey Joey?,,,,Monica,,
 You read comic books right?,,,,Monica,,
" Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah…,,,,Monica,,
 What?! Really?!,,,,Monica,,
" No you’re fine. (Joey checks anyway.) All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?",,,,Monica,,
 What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! (Her stomach) As hard as you can!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y’know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, Phoebe!",,,,Monica,,
 You’re getting a crush on your sister’s fiancée.,,,,Monica,,
 I can’t answer that! Chandler’s my husband.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
" Ross is really strong! Okay, he’s the strongest out of all three of you! (Joey looks at her.) Except for Joey.",,,,Monica,,
" Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! (Breaks it up.) Now listen, no one’s gonna fight in this apartment.",,,,Monica,,
" (To Chandler) Look honey, you don’t have to do this, okay? It’s the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You’re loyal, you’re honest, and you have integrity! That’s the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!",,,,Monica,,
 (To Phoebe) Oh God!,,,,Monica,,
 Chandler’s making his s*x face.,,,,Monica,,
" Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost.",,,,Monica,,
 (laughs) Is that a secret or a lie.,,,,Monica,,
 Chandler please!,,,,Monica,,
 Let’s go big bunny!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God! You cleaned! (Gasps) Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?",,,,Monica,,
 Well then who?,,,,Monica,,
" (shocked) I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then…",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!",,,,Monica,,
 Did she really say that?,,,,Monica,,
" Fine, I can do it. (Gets anxious.) Whew.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, usually when I’m this anxious, I clean!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh well umm, I make it myself! It’s two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is…y’know what? We just met.",,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) I love her.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (As Brenda exits Monica notices something.),,,,Monica,,
 She stole my jeans!,,,,Monica,,
 I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!,,,,Monica,,
 Don’t you see? It’s the perfect crime!,,,,Monica,,
 I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!,,,,Monica,,
 I guess.,,,,Monica,,
 Fine. I’m just glad I didn’t give her my secret ingredient.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah! (Laughs.),,,,Monica,,
 Nice jeans!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh. (Holds on to it.) (To herself) You’re not gettin’ it.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I fell asleep.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That’ll really work up your appetite for lunch.",,,,Monica,,
 Hello.,,,,Monica,,
" I’m sorry. I’ve never had a maid before, is this not okay?",,,,Monica,,
" Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.",,,,Monica,,
 Because I put my head between her legs.,,,,Monica,,
 They’re my pants!,,,,Monica,,
 No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.,,,,Monica,,
 Fine. (Brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink bra strap on the way.) She’s wearing my bra!,,,,Monica,,
 My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!,,,,Monica,,
 Here’s the plan! Okay? I’m going to leave you get a look at Brenda’s bra!,,,,Monica,,
 I would do it but she thinks I’m attracted to her!,,,,Monica,,
 Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we’re a team! We’re in this together!,,,,Monica,,
" Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman’s breasts all the time!",,,,Monica,,
 Do you see this? (Mimics him drooling over a woman’s breasts.),,,,Monica,,
" Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you’ll know it’s mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there’s a very noticeable rip.",,,,Monica,,
 (looking at Rachel’s jeans) Where did you get those jeans?!,,,,Monica,,
 No I didn’t!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!,,,,Monica,,
 The pink one with the flowers?!,,,,Monica,,
 Sounds about right.,,,,Monica,,
 (recognizing him and panicking) No you don’t!,,,,Monica,,
" I’m sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!",,,,Monica,,
" Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!",,,,Monica,,
" (entering) Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you’re gonna have a bachelor party.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!",,,,Monica,,
" Come on! Come on, it’ll be fun! It’ll make me feel so much better.",,,,Monica,,
" So don’t think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a…a two month anniversary present.",,,,Monica,,
 Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!,,,,Monica,,
" Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl’s number.,,,,Monica,,
 My husband.,,,,Monica,,
 She’s a stripper.,,,,Monica,,
" Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God Stu! I-I can’t believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she’s a hooker?,,,,Monica,,
" (entering quickly) She’s a hooker! She’s a hooker! She’s a… (Stops as she sees her.) Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone. (Goes and shakes the hooker’s hand.)",,,,Monica,,
 I swear I didn’t know she was a hooker! I mean wh—Did you let her smoke in here?,,,,Monica,,
" Y’know what? I’m gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper (turns on the radio), and you’re gonna get a stripper. (She starts to strip.)",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I’ll take them off. (Goes to do so.)",,,,Monica,,
" Gotcha sailor. (Kicks one of her shoes off and it lands in the kitchen knocking something down, but she continues to strip.)",,,,Monica,,
" (entering) Oh good you’re all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o’clock. (To Rachel) Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?",,,,Monica,,
" He was in Ross’s class…marching band…kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.",,,,Monica,,
" No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven’t thought about him in a long time… (Stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (Pause) Anyway, umm Will’s, Will’s here on business and he didn’t have a place to go so I invited him here.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, and by the way, he’s lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! (Joey clears his throat.) I still love Chandler.",,,,Monica,,
" All right okay, just so you know, I’m not gonna make a turkey this year.",,,,Monica,,
 Well Phoebe doesn’t eat turkey…,,,,Monica,,
" All right! Okay, it’s just Phoebe. Will’s still on a diet, Chandler doesn’t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel’s having her aversion to poultry.",,,,Monica,,
" Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work.",,,,Monica,,
 All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.,,,,Monica,,
" All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, isn’t weird to think about how next year at this time they’ll be a little baby at the table? (Chandler turns around in horror.) (Seeing him) Rachel’s! But good to know where you’re at!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 You too!,,,,Monica,,
" Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he’s really into the game so I don’t want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins? (Hands her a stack of them.)",,,,Monica,,
 I’m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.,,,,Monica,,
" No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barn dance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?",,,,Monica,,
 Is your team winning hon?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I didn’t know you liked football.",,,,Monica,,
 You like Green Bay?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 Aww thanks! God Will I’m so glad that you came! You look great! You must’ve lost like…,,,,Monica,,
 A pie! (Will brought a pie.),,,,Monica,,
" You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.",,,,Monica,,
 This is Phoebe.,,,,Monica,,
 (to Will) Wanna give me a hand?,,,,Monica,,
 Well you look incredible too! You’re just—you’re so fit!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.",,,,Monica,,
 Good. And Rachel Green too. (Will stops suddenly.),,,,Monica,,
 Is there a problem?,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you’ve got almost an entire turkey to eat.",,,,Monica,,
 All right.,,,,Monica,,
 Will! From high school.,,,,Monica,,
 (to Will) Joey.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey sweetie. Oh good. (Takes the baking dish from her.),,,,Monica,,
 That’s Will from high school!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, dinner’s ready!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, so who won?",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" (breaking it up) Uh Rachel? Rachel, why don’t you sit here? (Next to Joey) And Will you sit way over there. (The other side of the table.)",,,,Monica,,
 (laughs) This is Chandler’s chicken. This is the turkey. (Sets down a huge turkey.),,,,Monica,,
 About nineteen pounds.,,,,Monica,,
" (To Rachel) Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh Will. But you-you’ve worked so hard…,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (Chandler grabs the dish from Monica and hands it to Will who starts dishing out a large helping.),,,,Monica,,
 I swear I didn’t. (To Ross and Will) Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?,,,,Monica,,
" Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.",,,,Monica,,
 You started that?!,,,,Monica,,
 Everyone at our school heard it!,,,,Monica,,
 I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, you don’t have to finish that.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh! Me too!,,,,Monica,,
 That’s not totally true.,,,,Monica,,
" Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.",,,,Monica,,
 It’s true?!!,,,,Monica,,
 Didn’t she walk with a cane?,,,,Monica,,
" All right, listen you’re just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!",,,,Monica,,
" And Ross, if it weren’t for Rachel’s rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you’ve been through so much since then. And right now you’ve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can’t you just let this go?,,,,Monica,,
" Well Joey, we’re all…we’re all very proud of you.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, you want some?",,,,Monica,,
 Hey! So what do you think?,,,,Monica,,
" Yes! Now, they’re a little more than I normally spend on boots…or rent (Shows him the receipt.)",,,,Monica,,
 I know.,,,,Monica,,
" I’m sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, ""Oh, these are way too expensive for you.""",,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
 They’re mine!,,,,Monica,,
" Honey, I’m not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I’m going to wear them all the time. You’ll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?",,,,Monica,,
 Nice try; I’m keeping the boots.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey guys!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey. (Sits down on the arm of the couch.),,,,Monica,,
" See Chandler? I’m getting a lot of use out of them already! They’re very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants…",,,,Monica,,
 (almost crying) They hurt so much!,,,,Monica,,
 The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!,,,,Monica,,
" I can’t! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I’d wear them all the time, I just can’t give them away!",,,,Monica,,
 I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.,,,,Monica,,
 (standing up) Ahhhhhhhh!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh nothing I’m just—just was yawning. (Mimics the groan from before and stretches.),,,,Monica,,
" Honey, we don’t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?",,,,Monica,,
 I-I don’t-I don’t think that I’m gonna wear the boots tonight.,,,,Monica,,
" Well y’know, I’m just-I’m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!",,,,Monica,,
" Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don’t really go with it.",,,,Monica,,
" Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I’ll wear the boots. In fact, I’ll go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay? (She starts to walk which causes her to start crying) Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots! (Runs into the bedroom and mixes saying ‘ow’ with laughing.),,,,Monica,,
 Yeah! I didn’t know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh no, we can’t walk!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?,,,,Monica,,
 I can’t walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They’re killing me! One toe at a time!",,,,Monica,,
 How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. (She starts taking them off.) Ah…Ooh…Oohh…Ohh…Oh God…Ohh…Oh…Ohh…Ohhhh…",,,,Monica,,
 (notices something in the window) Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!,,,,Monica,,
 My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.",,,,Monica,,
 Well I don’t have them either. Where are they?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay. (She gets off him.) God well, we gotta go back and get them!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I’m never gonna wear them again. I just didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (Climbs back on his back.) All right.,,,,Monica,,
 (to the boots) Bye boots—Wait! Half off?! (Chandler runs off.),,,,Monica,,
" Yes, hi.",,,,Monica,,
 No leg-chewing for us sir.,,,,Monica,,
 I can’t think of anything we’re doing. (Quietly) Why can’t I think of anything we’re doing?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow! (Doug exits.) Just so you know, we’re not seeing him tomorrow. (Chandler wonders why.) I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?",,,,Monica,,
 That’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.,,,,Monica,,
 Why did you do that?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, I could’ve had you if I wanted you.",,,,Monica,,
 You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?,,,,Monica,,
 Like asking her to move in with you?,,,,Monica,,
 Making her a mixed tape?,,,,Monica,,
" All right. Have you said, ""I love you?"" You could say, I love you.",,,,Monica,,
 That is a slap in the face.,,,,Monica,,
 Hi Roger.,,,,Monica,,
" Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he’ll have s*x with you.",,,,Monica,,
 From the tequila factory?,,,,Monica,,
 Come here. I can breath through my mouth.,,,,Monica,,
" I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?",,,,Monica,,
 (interrupting) I love it! It’s huge!! Let’s open it! Open it!! (Monica rips open the paper.),,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.",,,,Monica,,
 All right. (He goes to push it and it doesn’t move.),,,,Monica,,
" Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like—Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!",,,,Monica,,
 Well I-I really don’t remember the name of it.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, you just—you put a quarter in and y’know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.",,,,Monica,,
 Don’t feel bad for me! I won like every time!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I’m next. (Phoebe starts another game.) Don’t! Don’t start another game! I said I’m next! Phoebe!",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler! Phoebe’s hogging the game!,,,,Monica,,
 You only think it’s stupid because you suck at it.,,,,Monica,,
" No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don’t you go home and wait for the thank you card?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay. Phoebe that’s it. Come on, get out—out of the chair. Get out! (She goes to move Phoebe, but Phoebe goes limp and Monica can’t move her.) Oh come…Phoebe!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
 Well it clearly wasn’t showering or shaving.,,,,Monica,,
" Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!",,,,Monica,,
 What is the matter with your hand?,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, why would you do that?",,,,Monica,,
 You think this is clever?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey wait a minute, this one isn’t dirty.",,,,Monica,,
" Ah, well if you don’t clear this off, you won’t be getting one of those from me. But Ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can’t be there.",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler! He’s seven; he’s not stupid.,,,,Monica,,
" All right, look I’m just gonna unplug it.",,,,Monica,,
 Honey you-you got to beat your scores!,,,,Monica,,
" All right fine. Fine, I’ll do it. I’ve just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I got that. I’ll escape over there. I’ll come back over here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It’s got—Right—(She dies.) Well, you’re just a little bitch, aren’t you?",,,,Monica,,
 They’re all Chandler.,,,,Monica,,
 But Ben is coming over tonight and he can’t see this.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God Phoebe, you’re on fire!",,,,Monica,,
 Don’t touch her!!,,,,Monica,,
 (airily) Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 I just had the most amazing bath.,,,,Monica,,
" Wait, you like them with me.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, baths are so relaxing!",,,,Monica,,
" How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.",,,,Monica,,
" Boy, do I have a surprise for you!",,,,Monica,,
" No, but someone’s really not going to get over that idea, are they?",,,,Monica,,
 I drew you a bath!,,,,Monica,,
" Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it’s a boy bath!",,,,Monica,,
" I swear, if you try it, you will love it!",,,,Monica,,
 Absolutely.,,,,Monica,,
 Bet I know how that discussion’s going to go.,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) So?,,,,Monica,,
" I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!",,,,Monica,,
 Hello?,,,,Monica,,
 You know what? I-I think I’ll wait out here.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh. (She goes into the bathroom.) What’s wrong?,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, let’s talk about something else.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and…",,,,Monica,,
 You did? What was he talking about?,,,,Monica,,
 (groans) That was a long night.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, he was talking about rules.",,,,Monica,,
" Umm, and looking at people differently.",,,,Monica,,
 What did he tell you?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.",,,,Monica,,
 Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!,,,,Monica,,
" And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!",,,,Monica,,
 Just a minute! (To Chandler) That’s Mrs. Tribbiani!,,,,Monica,,
" Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?",,,,Monica,,
 You just stay here! (Dumps a jar of bath salts in the bathtub),,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you had that?",,,,Monica,,
" I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.",,,,Monica,,
 Nothing.,,,,Monica,,
" I mean, I-I, I really shouldn’t say. I mean, I’m really not supposed to.",,,,Monica,,
 It’s a humdinger!,,,,Monica,,
 Somebody likes you!,,,,Monica,,
 No!,,,,Monica,,
 It’s Joey!,,,,Monica,,
 Is it something you’d be interested in?,,,,Monica,,
" I guess that makes sense. So, you think you’re going to talk to him?",,,,Monica,,
" Not Chandler, just Joey.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I’m going to take a bath. I’m just going to get a magazine.",,,,Monica,,
 What do you think you’re doing?,,,,Monica,,
" I know that you’re new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.",,,,Monica,,
" Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you’re just a girl in a tub!",,,,Monica,,
 She pulled it out of me! She’s like a conversational wizard! How’d it go?,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 (Pause) I don’t think I’d care.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God! A friend he’s looking at differently, but it’s wrong. It’s Rachel!",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, cover it up with the boat!",,,,Monica,,
" It sure is nice to do this together, isn’t it?",,,,Monica,,
 I’m not touching you.,,,,Monica,,
 It’s the salts.,,,,Monica,,
" (To herself) Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!",,,,Monica,,
" (opens the door wearing a robe, but leaves the chain on) Hey, whatâ€™s up?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, okay. No problem.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Here you go.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.,,,,Monica,,
 Yes! Exactly.,,,,Monica,,
 (laughs) No. (Closes the door as Chandler walks up.),,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, I can explain!",,,,Monica,,
" Well umm, Alexandra has beenâ€¦",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, donâ€™t get upset!",,,,Monica,,
 Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they donâ€™t like us do they? (They gave them a pok-a-dotted punch bowl.),,,,Monica,,
" No, it doesnâ€™t say where it came from. Where would we return it?",,,,Monica,,
 Why donâ€™t we just find a place for it?,,,,Monica,,
 No! Thatâ€™s where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, okay. Here, why donâ€™t you let me do it?",,,,Monica,,
 No reason. I-I keep private things in there.,,,,Monica,,
 Feminine stuff.,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-youâ€™ll let it go.",,,,Monica,,
 Thank you! (He tries the door again and Monica glares at him.),,,,Monica,,
 Well itâ€™sâ€¦I mean Iâ€™d justâ€”Iâ€™d be self-conscious. Youâ€™re my friend; Iâ€™d be naked.,,,,Monica,,
" Thatâ€™s different, we were roommates! And when?!",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, if it means that much to youâ€¦",,,,Monica,,
 Dinosaurs.,,,,Monica,,
 Yes.,,,,Monica,,
 Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!,,,,Monica,,
 No. Ooohhâ€¦,,,,Monica,,
 (in a sexy voice) Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh God Phoebe!! (Phoebe covers one ear.) Oh thatâ€™s it! Thatâ€™s it! Right there! Oh! (Tries to cover the other ear.) Ooooh-oooh-oooohâ€¦ (Covers both ears and continues the massage with her elbows.),,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!",,,,Monica,,
" So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Whatâ€™s going on?,,,,Monica,,
 What? (Laughs.),,,,Monica,,
 What?! Youâ€™re crazy! Thereâ€™s nothing sexual about the noises I make!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh myâ€”This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, Iâ€™m never gonna get massaged again!",,,,Monica,,
 Really?!,,,,Monica,,
 Are you sure?,,,,Monica,,
 I guess.,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) (Gasps) How did you get in there?!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh no! You werenâ€™t supposed to see this!,,,,Monica,,
" No Chandler, you donâ€™t understand! (Chandler starts singing the theme for Sanford and Son, an old TV show starring Redd Fox.) Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? Iâ€™m yâ€™knowâ€¦Iâ€™m sick.",,,,Monica,,
 Really? You promise you wonâ€™t tell anyone?,,,,Monica,,
 Wellâ€¦itâ€™s just ummâ€¦Iâ€™m afraid you might mess it up.,,,,Monica,,
 Ohhh.,,,,Monica,,
 Ohh. Oh! Ohh!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh God!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh yeah right there!,,,,Monica,,
 Uh Phoebe?,,,,Monica,,
" (entering with something behind her back) Phoebe, c’mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.",,,,Monica,,
 Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe’s opinion on for Valentine’s Day.,,,,Monica,,
 Not really.,,,,Monica,,
" All right, big brother. (holds up two erm…revealing articles of clothing) Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?",,,,Monica,,
" (from her bedroom) Okay! I’ll be right out. I’m slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.",,,,Monica,,
 (entering from her bedroom) So what do you think? (referring to her outfit),,,,Monica,,
 (to herself) I’ve still got it!,,,,Monica,,
 What is it?,,,,Monica,,
" Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe’s. Why were you even watching it?",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you p0rn for Valentine’s Day… (pulls a video out of a basket) you were right! Apparently, it’s about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having s*x with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! (looks closer) Oh, wait a minute. Those aren’t stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, what’s going on?",,,,Monica,,
 Mm-hmm.,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, we can’t let this tape wreck Valentine’s Day!",,,,Monica,,
" Child-birth, it’s a natural thing! It’s beautiful.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!",,,,Monica,,
 Don’t touch me!,,,,Monica,,
 How long has it been this time?,,,,Monica,,
 That’s better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it…except all I did was think about it.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don’t we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, thank God!",,,,Monica,,
 Come in!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, my God.",,,,Monica,,
" Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here.",,,,Monica,,
" No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!",,,,Monica,,
" She’s right…of course not. Honey, get the tape.",,,,Monica,,
 It’s…still beautiful.,,,,Monica,,
" I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!",,,,Monica,,
 Oh…Rach!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don’t say that again.",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about! First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she’d react.",,,,Monica,,
 Joey…he’s not even thinking about going after Rachel!,,,,Monica,,
" No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean, listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont.",,,,Monica,,
 He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him.,,,,Monica,,
" Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you’re still his friend.",,,,Monica,,
" All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.",,,,Monica,,
 Hi!,,,,Monica,,
" So, what have you guys been doing?",,,,Monica,,
" I know! What is this, 1985?!",,,,Monica,,
 Not really.,,,,Monica,,
" So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God! That’s my restaurant, I’m the chef there.",,,,Monica,,
 No!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I’d like a latte. Oh y’know what? If you’re gonna talk about me, I’m gonna go with you.",,,,Monica,,
" (returning) Phoebe, good work.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah! Oh he’s great, I love him. (Walks away and Chandler glares at Phoebe.)",,,,Monica,,
" Me too! Yeah, Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.",,,,Monica,,
" You know what I’d love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese—Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries… (Breathlessly) And pate. Oh, I’m really not high, it’s just I used to be fat.",,,,Monica,,
 I’d move in tomorrow!,,,,Monica,,
 I’d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn’t that be nice?,,,,Monica,,
 Are you okay? You’ve been acting weird all afternoon.,,,,Monica,,
 Jeez! What is with you?,,,,Monica,,
" All right, what’s going on?",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, you don’t believe in soul mates?",,,,Monica,,
 I don’t believe in soul mates either.,,,,Monica,,
 No. I don’t think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.,,,,Monica,,
" No, I’ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?",,,,Monica,,
 I know.,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, you have to talk to her!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey Rachel!,,,,Monica,,
 I don’t see him. Hey! Maybe he’s in the sugar bowl! (Opens the sugar bowl) Joey? Nope! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.),,,,Monica,,
 What’s up?,,,,Monica,,
 We were playing a game.,,,,Monica,,
 Sure.,,,,Monica,,
" (To Joey) Okay, did you hear that?",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, you gotta talk to her.",,,,Monica,,
" Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they’re hungry.",,,,Monica,,
" This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it’s weird, it’s awkward, but you gotta at least try.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I’m done. Read mine.",,,,Monica,,
 (stunned) I-I’m the head chef. I-I can’t get promoted.,,,,Monica,,
 You mean your pink shirt?,,,,Monica,,
" No, I-I haven’t seen your pink shirt.",,,,Monica,,
 Tea gives Phoebe the trots.,,,,Monica,,
" Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?",,,,Monica,,
 Where is the James Taylor CD?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we’re just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.",,,,Monica,,
" Hmm, I don’t know. We really have to talk this through.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I-I’m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, like I don’t know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.",,,,Monica,,
" Good. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?",,,,Monica,,
" Uh I really don’t know what to tell you Rach, I really don’t. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah Joey she’s…Rachel’s got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! (To Chandler) Y’know what, if we’re gonna make dinner we’re gonna have to leave. Yeah. (She and Chandler exit.)",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, both yours.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah? The work problem?,,,,Monica,,
 You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!,,,,Monica,,
 Chandler has two copies of Annie!,,,,Monica,,
 That’s not your regular dry cleaners.,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
" Don’t worry Phoebe, you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.",,,,Monica,,
 Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I’m-I’m gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts. (She points to and walks over to the electric clothes rack they have.),,,,Monica,,
" (to the clerk) Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
" (To Ross) Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I’d really like to.",,,,Monica,,
" Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it’s always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I’m going to make them cry.",,,,Monica,,
" No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, ""God, your brother."" Know what they’ll say this year? ""God, you""",,,,Monica,,
 Really you can do that?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh I’m working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. (Hands him a picture.)",,,,Monica,,
 It’s a dead dog. That’s Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.,,,,Monica,,
" The good stuff, huh?",,,,Monica,,
 You got a present for my parents. That’s so sweet.,,,,Monica,,
 What?!,,,,Monica,,
 That’s my old dog. He passed away years ago.,,,,Monica,,
 It’s out on the island. It’s in Massapequa.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I got my note cards. (To Chandler) Do you got the presents?",,,,Monica,,
 And I’ve got the car keys.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.,,,,Monica,,
" It’s just that, it’s so much.",,,,Monica,,
 I feel terrible.,,,,Monica,,
 Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit ‘em. I can’t wait. They’re going to be crying so hard. They’re going to be fighting for breath.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay it’s time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I’m going to do it.",,,,Monica,,
" No, no it’s going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don’t say it enough, but I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parents will join her.) When I look around this room, I’m-I’m saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can’t because she’s dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by the stage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she’s dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? (Chandler covers his ears) Didn’t see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (Waits for people to cry, but doesn’t get any tears.) You people are made of stone! Here’s to mom and dad! Whatever!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay that’s it. I give up. At mom and dad’s 40th anniversary, you’re the one giving the speech.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, come on.",,,,Monica,,
" (starts to cry) Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 How cool is this?! We know three down! I’m touching three down! (She has her hand on his shoulder.),,,,Monica,,
" Three down knows I’m married, what’s three down doin’?",,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) You think we’re being obvious?,,,,Monica,,
 Joey! You’re doing great!,,,,Monica,,
 Bye. (They resume their previous positions.),,,,Monica,,
" You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So... (Looks at Joey.)",,,,Monica,,
 You slept with her didn’t you?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, your mother!",,,,Monica,,
" Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.",,,,Monica,,
" Well it wasn’t my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!",,,,Monica,,
 (interrupting her) Oh give it a rest!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, y’know what? Don’t worry, okay? We’ll take care of it. We’ll call her. Just go home and get ready.",,,,Monica,,
" Go! I have it in my book. Go! (Rachel leaves and Monica calls Mrs. Green.) (To Phoebe) Wait a minute! If you’re in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her—Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it’s Monica Geller.",,,,Monica,,
" (on phone) Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we’ve decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m-I’m so sorry.",,,,Monica,,
" (To Phoebe) Oh my God, my ass is sweating! (on phone) Please! Please! Can you come? It’s today at four.",,,,Monica,,
 Thank you. (Hangs up.),,,,Monica,,
 Son of a bitch! (Calls Mrs. Green again.),,,,Monica,,
 You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!,,,,Monica,,
 Hi!,,,,Monica,,
" Yes, thank you so much. And again, we’re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.",,,,Monica,,
 She’s still mad.,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, Sandra’s mad at you too. It-it doesn’t bother you?",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. I can do that. (Pause) I gotta go powder my ass.,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.,,,,Monica,,
" That’s right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don’t want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!",,,,Monica,,
 (To Phoebe) This is great! Now she’s gonna be mad at Rachel! Y’know what? And I’m just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.,,,,Monica,,
" Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you’re the most important person in this room. And in the world!",,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.",,,,Monica,,
 It is going to be okay! (Mrs. Green glances over her shoulder and glares at Monica while she heads for the bathroom.) It was worth a shot.,,,,Monica,,
 It’s frightening.,,,,Monica,,
 (laughs) You’re still so funny. You’re so funny. (To Phoebe) What do I do?,,,,Monica,,
 Y’know what? You’re-you’re right.,,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! (She ignores Monica and Monica follows her out into the hall with Phoebe in tow.) It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn’t on purpose! But what you’re during to me now is just plain spiteful!",,,,Monica,,
 That’s right! Maybe it’s time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady…old lady…lady!,,,,Monica,,
" So whenever you’re ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day! (Monica and Phoebe reenter the apartment and Monica closes the door on a stunned Mrs. Green.) I can’t feel my legs!",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah? I’m proud of me too.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay. (When Phoebe turns around Monica runs out into the hall after Mrs. Green.) Mrs. Green! Okay I’m really sorry!! I’m apologizing for the—(She trips and falls down the stairs.) (Pause) Okay, I bit my tongue, but I’m still really sorry!",,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 (seeing the stack of newspapers) Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!,,,,Monica,,
 (reading) Oh dear God!,,,,Monica,,
 What about the rest of Manhattan?!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, this is horrible!",,,,Monica,,
 I’m so humiliated!,,,,Monica,,
" You don’t think that umm, (reading) ""The chef’s Mahi Mahi was awful awful,"" is bad press?",,,,Monica,,
 Is he right? Am I really—Am I awful?,,,,Monica,,
" We said at the movies, but…",,,,Monica,,
 Joey! (He returns) Now that you’re here…,,,,Monica,,
" Hey Joey, come taste this.",,,,Monica,,
 Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well… (Feeds him a spoonful of what she’s cooking.) I’m getting my revenge!,,,,Monica,,
" No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bollet base again. Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! ""Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica.""",,,,Monica,,
" Hi! Umm, I’m Monica Geller, I’m the chef at Alessandro’s.",,,,Monica,,
" I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my boule base another chance.",,,,Monica,,
" Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think?",,,,Monica,,
 I can.,,,,Monica,,
" Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bournese has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly teradyne.",,,,Monica,,
 Monica.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (Does so.),,,,Monica,,
" Oh no! I don’t know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it’s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.",,,,Monica,,
" I-I-I’m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn’t hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?",,,,Monica,,
 That’s right.,,,,Monica,,
" Y’know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star. (Hands it to her.)",,,,Monica,,
" Wow! A star! (The class glares at her.) I know you all hate me and-and I’m sorry, but I don’t care.",,,,Monica,,
 Joey! I’m so proud of you!,,,,Monica,,
 Excuse me? He doesn’t even know what he’s doing!,,,,Monica,,
 I do! I’m a professional chef! (The class gasps.) Oh relax! It’s not a courtroom drama!,,,,Monica,,
" I’m-I’m sorry, it’s just that umm… Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro’s, and umm I just got a really bad review…",,,,Monica,,
 You do?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I’m totally crazy, but you-you like the food?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay then, I don’t stink. I’m a good chef. Okay. (Starts to leave.)",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Are we gonna take a limo?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!,,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing here so early?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, well Ross didn’t care enough to be here, so I think he’s out. You snooze you lose.",,,,Monica,,
" Well then somebody’s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.)",,,,Monica,,
 Star in a movie.,,,,Monica,,
" Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you’re gonna take him? Joey, I don’t think you’re comprehending just how slutty this dress is!",,,,Monica,,
" She’s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?",,,,Monica,,
" Hmm, care to make it interesting? I’ll bet you that she’ll have it by this time tomorrow.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, how much?",,,,Monica,,
 How about fifty bucks?,,,,Monica,,
 Damnit! Damnit!! Here’s your fifty bucks! (Pays Phoebe.),,,,Monica,,
 Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 She’s in the bathroom.,,,,Monica,,
 I’m actually with her on this one.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?,,,,Monica,,
" Well what is it? What is it? If it’s gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.",,,,Monica,,
 Do it!,,,,Monica,,
" I’m just saying it’s been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!",,,,Monica,,
" All right, let’s be practical, if Ross isn’t willing to do it, he’s not the only guy in the world you can have s*x with. You can borrow Chandler—Chandler is good!",,,,Monica,,
 Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!,,,,Monica,,
 Wait a minute! Now I’m betting against all three of you?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, okay!",,,,Monica,,
 Two hundred.,,,,Monica,,
" That’s it. I’m done. I don’t care when the baby comes, no more betting.",,,,Monica,,
 Hello? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up.) I guess we can bet one more time.,,,,Monica,,
 How did you know that?! (Runs to yell at Joey’s apartment.) Joey! Chandler!! It’s time!,,,,Monica,,
" You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds. (Phoebe isn’t interested.) I bet you it has hair. (She’s still not interested.) I bet you it’s a girl.",,,,Monica,,
 (following her) I’ll give you really good odds.,,,,Monica,,
 How are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
 We took a cab. Did you guys walk?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, you wanna see something?",,,,Monica,,
" Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?",,,,Monica,,
" Listen uh, I-I’ve been doing some thinking, and I don’t know whether it’s because we’re here or Rachel’s giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.",,,,Monica,,
 (freaking out) What-what-what’s that now?!,,,,Monica,,
 What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we’re ready to have a baby now?!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. (Pause) ‘Cause I am ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.",,,,Monica,,
 That’s it! Right there! Is all I wanted!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!,,,,Monica,,
 What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 We are pretty good.,,,,Monica,,
" Well maybe I’m ready now. I mean, it’s a little scary, but maybe it’s right.",,,,Monica,,
 What?!!,,,,Monica,,
" So we’re gonna try? I mean, are we trying?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, hold on a sec.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, we could start trying. Now.",,,,Monica,,
" No, not here. Maybe here.",,,,Monica,,
 And it’s so clean!!,,,,Monica,,
 I think we found a place.,,,,Monica,,
" Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. Let’s hurry—Oh wait! Do we have a condom? (He looks at her.) Oh right! (Laughs and they resume making out when a nurse catches them in the act.),,,,Monica,,
" We could, or we can have s*x in it.",,,,Monica,,
 (lying down on the bed) Okay mister! Fertilize me!,,,,Monica,,
 Does that sound like Janice?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God! She’s amazing. Oh, oh I’m so glad you guys got drunk and had s*x!",,,,Monica,,
 What’s the matter?,,,,Monica,,
" It’s okay honey, you’ll find a name.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I’ve had them picked out since I was fourteen.",,,,Monica,,
" Umm, okay. If it’s a boy it’s Daniel.",,,,Monica,,
 I don’t want to say.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. It’s Emma.,,,,Monica,,
 Take it.,,,,Monica,,
 It’s clearly an Emma.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y’know, nothing goes with Bing. So I’m screwed. I mean… (Rachel hands Emma to Monica.) Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, that’s you. You’re our little Em. Oh what’s that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin? (To Chandler) You want a cousin right now?!",,,,Monica,,
" I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.",,,,Monica,,
 (entering with everyone else including Mr. Geller) Hi! Hey look who’s here!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, Aunt Liddy’s coming? That means we get five dollars each!",,,,Monica,,
 About what?,,,,Monica,,
 Isn’t she beautiful?,,,,Monica,,
 I want a baby.,,,,Monica,,
" Come on! Come on, if we have s*x again it’ll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?",,,,Monica,,
 Deal!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I still can’t believe my dad saw us having s*x! He didn’t make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!",,,,Monica,,
 Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?,,,,Monica,,
 It wasn’t fun?!,,,,Monica,,
" The truth is, Dad, we’re-we’re trying.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, we’re trying to get pregnant.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, that’s okay dad, we-we can wait until later.",,,,Monica,,
 Daddy?!,,,,Monica,,
 Daddy! I don’t think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had s*x.,,,,Monica,,
 I don’t feel good right now.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, now’s a good time. I’m on my way to have my ears cut off.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!,,,,Monica,,
" What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross’s baby! It’s-it’s so inappropriate. No, it’s worse than that. It’s wrong. It’s… It is bigger than mine! (Rachel’s engagement ring.)",,,,Monica,,
 You can’t marry him!,,,,Monica,,
 Well do you love him?,,,,Monica,,
 Sure?,,,,Monica,,
" Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?",,,,Monica,,
 (walking by with Chandler.) Hey dad!,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, I don’t wanna be negative so I’ll say that most of the signs you bought are good.",,,,Monica,,
 (looking at Chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) So sexy. (Waking him up.) Honey.,,,,Monica,,
 Honey why don’t you go lie down.,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe did the signs!,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.,,,,Monica,,
" Wow, he’s really not letting this go, is he?",,,,Monica,,
 Breaks your heart doesn’t it,,,,Monica,,
" Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.",,,,Monica,,
 It worked!,,,,Monica,,
" Umm, she Rach, not it, she.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my god, I am losing my mind.",,,,Monica,,
 Try feeding her again.,,,,Monica,,
" I know, that’s why I said again!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay what’s up,,,,Monica,,
 Oh yeah (smiles).,,,,Monica,,
 What? Who says that?,,,,Monica,,
 What’s going on?,,,,Monica,,
 Excuse me?,,,,Monica,,
" (stands up angry) Tulsa, Oklahoma!",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, I don’t even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!",,,,Monica,,
" Are you trying to tell me that we’re moving to Oklahoma, or that you’re gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?",,,,Monica,,
 Thank you.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.",,,,Monica,,
 About a week and a half.,,,,Monica,,
" Rach, try holding her a different way.",,,,Monica,,
" You’re just new at this, it’ll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn’t have been easy but you figured that out.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay I’ll take her, here. (Takes Emma)",,,,Monica,,
" (To Emma) Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby. (Emma stops crying and falls asleep)",,,,Monica,,
" It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!",,,,Monica,,
 I can’t believe it! She’s asleep! I got her to go to sleep! I have actual magical powers!,,,,Monica,,
" Yes I did, I’m Monica, Super Aunt",,,,Monica,,
 Yes I am!!,,,,Monica,,
 Say what?,,,,Monica,,
 (stands up to hand Emma back) Oh no no no no!,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep,,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 (loudly) What!?,,,,Monica,,
 (comes running out the kitchen to the bedroom) Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it!,,,,Monica,,
 I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing (Points to her wedding ring.),,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?,,,,Monica,,
 It's great! How?,,,,Monica,,
 So you're gonna be gone four days a week? (Thinks about it.) No.,,,,Monica,,
 No. I can't be away from you for that long.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.",,,,Monica,,
 I know! (They high-five.),,,,Monica,,
 Excuse me?,,,,Monica,,
 Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?,,,,Monica,,
" He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.",,,,Monica,,
 That I was going to eat him.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
 That's so sweet. Find anything?,,,,Monica,,
" Nothing, huh?",,,,Monica,,
 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.,,,,Monica,,
" Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.",,,,Monica,,
" (On phone) Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo (sp?) is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo (sp?) 'I'll take it!'",,,,Monica,,
 You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.,,,,Monica,,
" So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa.",,,,Monica,,
 Manhattan.,,,,Monica,,
" I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.",,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
 That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!,,,,Monica,,
 How was the pediatrician?,,,,Monica,,
 Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?,,,,Monica,,
 Where have you been?,,,,Monica,,
 Promise to call me when you land.,,,,Monica,,
 I love you too. (They kiss),,,,Monica,,
" (Runs out to the hallway) Chandler, wait. It goes: Old job, (Raises her hand) new job, (Raises her hand really high) you. This is just something I have to do.",,,,Monica,,
 I love you so much.,,,,Monica,,
 Can I talk now?,,,,Monica,,

: hey Joey,,,,Monica,,
: Joey I am not going to objectify woman with you (looks at the woman) but if her face is as nice as her ass woah mamma.,,,,Monica,,
: yeah he has to stay in Tulsa this weekend,,,,Monica,,
": he has to work, there's some rush on the big (pause, thinks) ah damn it one of these days I'm really gonna have to start listening when he talks about his job.",,,,Monica,,
: maybe I will go (thinks) yea will have a second honeymoon at the Tulsa romana.,,,,Monica,,
: how do you know I have one of those?,,,,Monica,,
: is everything all right?,,,,Monica,,
: I'm gonna go freshen up ok,,,,Monica,,
: Hey Rach its me ok I just got the Chandler's room and I caught him molesting himself.,,,,Monica,,
: yea well the weird part is... he was getting off to a shark attack show!,,,,Monica,,
: Yes! Chandler Watches Shark p0rn!,,,,Monica,,
": do you know how many times I've seen him jump up like that, believe me I know what he was doing.",,,,Monica,,
: what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone. not if he gets his jollys to jaws!,,,,Monica,,
: Eww are you talking about my bother.,,,,Monica,,
: But you don't remember sleeping with her.,,,,Monica,,
": what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night",,,,Monica,,
: Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.,,,,Monica,,
": Joey, Joey.",,,,Monica,,
: you don't think sharks are sexy do you?,,,,Monica,,
": Hi, how was your flight? (She hugs him)",,,,Monica,,
": Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I. (Monica shows him the tape then puts it in) have a little surprise for you.",,,,Monica,,
: Ok (sits down next to him) This is how much I love you. (She presses play then puts her arm around Chandler's neck.),,,,Monica,,
: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.,,,,Monica,,
": Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?",,,,Monica,,
": Honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash.",,,,Monica,,
": sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.",,,,Monica,,
: I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks turn you on!,,,,Monica,,
: then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.,,,,Monica,,
: really?,,,,Monica,,
: I cannot tell you how happy that makes me! (They hug),,,,Monica,,
": Im very, very drunk right now.",,,,Monica,,
 What are you talking about? We're all together right now.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, dear god!",,,,Monica,,
 (opening the door) Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 Hmhmm. (ties up),,,,Monica,,
" This is not, what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating and Chandler's gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.",,,,Monica,,
" Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We'll probably be the first ones there.",,,,Monica,,
 (naughty in doorway) Welcome home. I've missed you. join me in the bedroom?,,,,Monica,,
" (comes over) O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?",,,,Monica,,
 You don't need a shower.,,,,Monica,,
 What do I smell? (sniffs him) I smell smoke. Huh--did you smoke?,,,,Monica,,
 (gets a pack out of his jacket),,,,Monica,,
" How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling.",,,,Monica,,
 So what? Don't you have any will power?,,,,Monica,,
 You said that was sexy!,,,,Monica,,
" That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again.",,,,Monica,,
 Mhmm.,,,,Monica,,
" Don't joke (?) with me, okay? I'm very, very upset right now.",,,,Monica,,
 Yes.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, I'll tell you what we're gonna do: We are already late for Phoebe's birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, we're gonna put this fight on hold and go have s*x.",,,,Monica,,
" s*x! This is the last day I'm ovulating, and when we don't do it now, we'll have to wait till next month. (walks towards bedroom)",,,,Monica,,
 Oh yeah!,,,,Monica,,
" Huh, and no cuddling.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh good, I hate it when you do that",,,,Monica,,
 Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have s*x right after my uncle's funeral",,,,Monica,,
" No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.",,,,Monica,,
 Yah.,,,,Monica,,
 D'you want to?,,,,Monica,,
 'kay.,,,,Monica,,
 You know what? Let's not talk.,,,,Monica,,
 Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, blablablabaybaybay.",,,,Monica,,
 I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have s*x with me while we're fighting.,,,,Monica,,
" That's right, I got mine.",,,,Monica,,
 (entering with husband) Happy birthday!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, we had a little fight.",,,,Monica,,
" You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. (being sat down) Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How d'you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.",,,,Monica,,
 Why would you do that?,,,,Monica,,
" Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.",,,,Monica,,
" Uch, you see, I'm ovulating.",,,,Monica,,
" Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.",,,,Monica,,
 Bye.,,,,Monica,,
" So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?",,,,Monica,,
 We don't have much time. Once the egg decended the oviduct ...,,,,Monica,,
" (in her apartment, screaming) I LOVE MY NEW JOB!",,,,Monica,,
 YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met. (Chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)",,,,Monica,,
 Maybe he didn't give you a chance.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, well... That had been your window.",,,,Monica,,
 Really? The scientist guy?,,,,Monica,,
 Continue...,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe!,,,,Monica,,
" Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?",,,,Monica,,
 What are you gonna do?,,,,Monica,,
 You have to tell David!,,,,Monica,,
 Heeeeeey!,,,,Monica,,
 (Doesn't believe what she's hearing) Was your cabin pressurised?,,,,Monica,,
" No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (Phoebe bursts out in a laugh)",,,,Monica,,
 Hi! There you are.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah! I think that's great!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh... How are they?,,,,Monica,,
 Yes... What is the end of that sentence?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, so?",,,,Monica,,
" Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...",,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe he's that upset about this...,,,,Monica,,
" Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! (Monica wipes away tears)",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! (Chandler turns to Joey)",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) That slayed me.",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.",,,,Monica,,
" Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.",,,,Monica,,
 What do you do with your money now?,,,,Monica,,
 Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I",,,,Monica,,
" (very excited) Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment?",,,,Monica,,
 My dad told me. They play golf together.,,,,Monica,,
" Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.",,,,Monica,,
" They just gonna love you, just be yourself.",,,,Monica,,
" I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be",,,,Monica,,
 You went out with Wallis Pincer?,,,,Monica,,
 I knew you didn't get a 1400!,,,,Monica,,
 (Monica looks at Rachel in disbelief) She said WHAT?,,,,Monica,,
 What are you guys doing? (Monica hears the moaning coming from the,,,,Monica,,
 So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?,,,,Monica,,
 That tape was never meant to be seen by... (pauses) Joey I would,,,,Monica,,
 Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you,,,,Monica,,
 Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?,,,,Monica,,
" Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all",,,,Monica,,
 Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life! (she,,,,Monica,,
 THAT'S NOT ME!,,,,Monica,,
 That b*st*rd taped over me! (Chandler's expression changes),,,,Monica,,
" I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!",,,,Monica,,
" Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?",,,,Monica,,
" No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.",,,,Monica,,
" What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..",,,,Monica,,
" <laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.",,,,Monica,,
 Careful. <hands Chandler a china plate> Careful. CAREFUL!,,,,Monica,,
" I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.",,,,Monica,,
" well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.",,,,Monica,,
" yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>",,,,Monica,,
" No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.",,,,Monica,,
 That was me.,,,,Monica,,
" Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.",,,,Monica,,
" Thats not how you see me, is it?",,,,Monica,,
 Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.,,,,Monica,,
 Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.,,,,Monica,,
 No you learn these things. You grow into it.,,,,Monica,,
 I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.,,,,Monica,,
" Can you hear me say ""You're grounded""?",,,,Monica,,
 How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh wait.. What are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.,,,,Monica,,
 Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!,,,,Monica,,
 uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.,,,,Monica,,
 I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.,,,,Monica,,
 Like only if the queen comes?,,,,Monica,,
 Bye plates!,,,,Monica,,
 What? Something happened with the plates?,,,,Monica,,
 Hello?,,,,Monica,,
 Really? But tomorrow night’s the only one I get off from the restaurant. If you go to the game then we won’t have another night together for a week.,,,,Monica,,
" Look. I don’t want to be one of those wives that says “You can’t go to the game”, “you have to spend time with me”, so, if you just realize it on your own?",,,,Monica,,
 [On phone] Tell him you haven’t seen your wife in a long time. [In apartment] Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that…what little time that we have is precious.,,,,Monica,,
 Hi! [Surprised],,,,Monica,,
 Welcome home.,,,,Monica,,
 What do you think?,,,,Monica,,
 Just a second.,,,,Monica,,
 Why not?,,,,Monica,,
 So you lied to him?,,,,Monica,,
 Hi!,,,,Monica,,
" [Nervous giggle] Because I, erm, well, Chandler’s gonna be home in a couple of days, so I thought that I would just, er, practice the art of seduction.",,,,Monica,,
" I was just doing Chandler’s side of the conversation, y’know like “Hi”, “How do I look” [In Chandler’s voice] “Really sexy”, “Could I be any more turned on?”",,,,Monica,,
" Because, one of them is for you! [Monica goes to get a glass. Chandler looks at Joey through the peep-hole and Chandler ducks. Monica comes back to the door with the two glasses of red wine. Gives one to Joey. ‘Clinks’ the glasses together] Okay, bye, bye!",,,,Monica,,
 You might wanna keep practising.,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you are not in Tulsa.",,,,Monica,,
 I don’t want him to think that I'm having an affair.,,,,Monica,,
 Yes. Because all good plans start with “I’ll just go down the fire escape…”,,,,Monica,,
 Aren’t you afraid that Joey’s going to figure all this out? [Silence] I heard it!,,,,Monica,,
 Scary pigeon’s back?,,,,Monica,,
" Huh, Chandler – you’re home!",,,,Monica,,
 What are you saying?,,,,Monica,,
 There's no man in here! How dare you accuse me of that? [Slaps Chandler],,,,Monica,,
 I arranged some pillows on the bed to make it look like a guy!,,,,Monica,,
 I think that's you.,,,,Monica,,
 I can’t believe you thought I was cheating. You owe me an apology.,,,,Monica,,
" It’s an honest mistake. It can happen to anybody. Alright, see ya.",,,,Monica,,
 Joey?,,,,Monica,,
 I don’t know what to say. We shouldn’t have lied to you.,,,,Monica,,
 You can go.,,,,Monica,,
" You should go to the game. It’s okay, I want you to.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, it’ll be fine. Y’know, maybe I’ll stay and practice the art of seduction.",,,,Monica,,
 That’s gonna be so hot!,,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.,,,,Monica,,
" It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!",,,,Monica,,
" It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week,",,,,Monica,,
 (shocked) You're not gonna be here new year's eve??,,,,Monica,,
 No!,,,,Monica,,
 Come on Ben.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa,",,,,Monica,,
" (to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, is that okay?",,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a merry,,,,Monica,,
 So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?,,,,Monica,,
 Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.,,,,Monica,,
" Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about new year's eve.",,,,Monica,,
" Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?",,,,Monica,,
 What does she do there?,,,,Monica,,
 She did WHAT?,,,,Monica,,
 *What*??,,,,Monica,,
" Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest",,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay!,,,,Monica,,
 Merry Christmas.,,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" Well, not anymore.",,,,Monica,,
" I know, I just thought it would be fun.",,,,Monica,,
 Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that,,,,Monica,,
 Okay!,,,,Monica,,
 (breaking the kiss) Y'know what's weird?,,,,Monica,,
 This doesn't feel weird!,,,,Monica,,
 You're a really good kisser.,,,,Monica,,
 Hm-hmm!,,,,Monica,,
 Wow! You are really fast!,,,,Monica,,
 We're gonna see each other naked.,,,,Monica,,
 Do you wanna do it at the same time?,,,,Monica,,
 One!,,,,Monica,,
 Two!,,,,Monica,,
" Eh, we weren't that close anyway!",,,,Monica,,
" Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not",,,,Monica,,
 I think you're better than you think you are.,,,,Monica,,
 (interrupting) Know when to stop.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts",,,,Monica,,
" I can't get married until I get something old, something new,",,,,Monica,,
 You're so efficient. I love you!,,,,Monica,,
" No-no-no, wait! We need something old!",,,,Monica,,
 That'll work!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, now we just need something borrowed!",,,,Monica,,
 That's stealing!,,,,Monica,,
 Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.),,,,Monica,,
" Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask",,,,Monica,,
" Eh, you work for that.",,,,Monica,,
 You do?!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what",,,,Monica,,
 You thought about that?,,,,Monica,,
 How many kids were we gonna have?,,,,Monica,,
 What else did you think about?,,,,Monica,,
" (laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.",,,,Monica,,
" No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.",,,,Monica,,
 Uh-hmm.,,,,Monica,,
 I love you. (They kiss.),,,,Monica,,
" ""Wendy"" is a fat girl name.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing",,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing here?,,,,Monica,,
" But I thought if you left, you get fired.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my god!,,,,Monica,,
" No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!",,,,Monica,,
" You are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to",,,,Monica,,
" Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I just lost my erection.",,,,Monica,,
 You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There",,,,Monica,,
 I know!!! My erection is back!,,,,Monica,,
" (Flipping through bunch of folders as Chandler enters from bathroom) Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.,,,,Monica,,
 Don't you want to look through the rest?,,,,Monica,,
" You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!",,,,Monica,,
" I got one. ""Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best.""",,,,Monica,,
 I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.,,,,Monica,,
" ""Marriage. It's not for everybody.""",,,,Monica,,
" (Enters) Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. (Sees Ross) Didn't see you there Geller.",,,,Monica,,
 We're gonna have s*x.,,,,Monica,,
 Let me put it this way. We're having s*x whether you're here or not.,,,,Monica,,
" (Enters from the bedroom) Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.",,,,Monica,,
 (To Ross) Sorry. (To Chandler) But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.,,,,Monica,,
 What are you talking about?,,,,Monica,,
 What!? You faked it?,,,,Monica,,
 You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!,,,,Monica,,
" Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?",,,,Monica,,
 Like a month?,,,,Monica,,
" Really, you want to wait a year?",,,,Monica,,
 I really wanna have a baby.,,,,Monica,,
" No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.",,,,Monica,,
" It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really",,,,Monica,,
" It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I",,,,Monica,,
" Yes, please!",,,,Monica,,
 I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!,,,,Monica,,
 Would you stop staring at her?,,,,Monica,,
 What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.",,,,Monica,,
 They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.,,,,Monica,,
 (to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave),,,,Monica,,
 Hey Rach!,,,,Monica,,
 Ready for your birthday lunch?,,,,Monica,,
 Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?,,,,Monica,,
 You were just being so nice to him!,,,,Monica,,
 Right there! That was so fake!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.",,,,Monica,,
 Does he?,,,,Monica,,
 Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?,,,,Monica,,
 Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! (put her glass down),,,,Monica,,
" Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!",,,,Monica,,
 So this is what a stroke feels like.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up (Gavin shows up at the balcony windows).",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.",,,,Monica,,
" (from inside) Again, you're welcome.",,,,Monica,,
 Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! (screams from another room),,,,Monica,,
" No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,",,,,Monica,,
 Only if I don't have to get up and sing.,,,,Monica,,
" It's just, I'm not good at singing.",,,,Monica,,
" No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!",,,,Monica,,
 So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?,,,,Monica,,
 I'm there!,,,,Monica,,
 You kissed him?,,,,Monica,,
 Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?,,,,Monica,,
 I thought you hated him?,,,,Monica,,
 So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?,,,,Monica,,
" Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross",,,,Monica,,
 No I told you I can't.,,,,Monica,,
 What have you heard me sing?,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah I do rock that one.,,,,Monica,,
 Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...,,,,Monica,,
" ""Delta Dawn""",,,,Monica,,
 Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.,,,,Monica,,
" Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing ""Delta Dawn""",,,,Monica,,
" ""To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?""",,,,Monica,,
" ""Take me to the mansion in the sky-y"". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?",,,,Monica,,
" I can’t believe I did this. I can’t believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that",,,,Monica,,
 Good? Didn’t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That’s is the best gift ever.,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, for my next song I think I’ll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, you’re just in time, I’m about to sing another song!",,,,Monica,,
 And they love me!,,,,Monica,,
" All right, watch!",,,,Monica,,
" ""Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in this",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, who cares, they still love me! ""I am so excited...""",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my god.,,,,Monica,,
" Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...",,,,Monica,,
" You want a job? Turn off ""Oprah,"" and send out a resume!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, it's perfect.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
" No, it's not.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.,,,,Monica,,
 Okay.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler!,,,,Monica,,
 We're okay. I'm still ovulating.,,,,Monica,,
" So, let's do this.",,,,Monica,,
" Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.",,,,Monica,,
" Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?",,,,Monica,,
 Canoodling?,,,,Monica,,
" I don't know. I mean, I guess having s*x in front of a baby isn't so...",,,,Monica,,
 I guess you're right.,,,,Monica,,
 But what kind of a sick b*st*rd wants to do it in front of a deer?,,,,Monica,,
 She's asleep. Chandler?,,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
 She's asleep.,,,,Monica,,
" Yes, but we have to be fast.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, did you stop by here?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my god, then...",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, we were playing ""peek-a-boo."" She just – she loves it when I'm dramatic.",,,,Monica,,
" No, we weren't!",,,,Monica,,
" No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!",,,,Monica,,
 Unless what?,,,,Monica,,
" (shocked) Really? (She looks around, suddenly embarrassed) Let's get past the moment.",,,,Monica,,
" (hugging Chandler) Oh, honey, that's incredible!",,,,Monica,,
" Ross, you did not come up with ""got milk?""",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 He just left.,,,,Monica,,
 What is she talking about?,,,,Monica,,
 Is it a good play?,,,,Monica,,
 (sighs) He was so good in that movie of MacBeth. ,,,,Monica,,
" No, but… I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, how did the audition go? ",,,,Monica,,
 What happened?,,,,Monica,,
 So far so good! (Joey nods),,,,Monica,,
" (standing up, walking towards him) What's wrong?",,,,Monica,,
 So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.,,,,Monica,,
 What are they? (They sit down again),,,,Monica,,
" Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers? ",,,,Monica,,
 You okay?!,,,,Monica,,
 (bewildered) How do you know a mugger?,,,,Monica,,
 (shocked) Seriously?,,,,Monica,,
" (disapproving) Phoebe, that is awful!",,,,Monica,,
 You're mother killed herself!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.",,,,Monica,,
 (coughing) Wonderwoman!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?,,,,Monica,,
 That's it. ,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah?,,,,Monica,,
 So?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my god!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
" No, that seems about right.",,,,Monica,,
" Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering p0rn… on a Saturday afternoon?! (shocked) I was in the house! ",,,,Monica,,
 … that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah. ,,,,Monica,,
 … everybody we know? Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?,,,,Monica,,
" I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.",,,,Monica,,
 Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.,,,,Monica,,
 Why not?,,,,Monica,,
 Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey Joey!,,,,Monica,,
" Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.",,,,Monica,,
 (Looks exasperated) Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.,,,,Monica,,
 But Chandler lent you money!,,,,Monica,,
 Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.,,,,Monica,,
 Two thousand dollars?,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah...,,,,Monica,,
" Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?",,,,Monica,,
 You're a pig. And you can't do this.,,,,Monica,,
" Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing ""This is what my sister would look like"" (Looks at Chandler)",,,,Monica,,
 Is that a bit you guys do?,,,,Monica,,
 We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!,,,,Monica,,
 I hear wedding bells.,,,,Monica,,
 Don't you mean..groomy?,,,,Monica,,
 I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!,,,,Monica,,
 So you gave in and decided to call someone?,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you?,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want s*x or did you do something bad?",,,,Monica,,
" Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.",,,,Monica,,
 Okay...,,,,Monica,,
 I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.,,,,Monica,,
" You heard him! ""No bigger!"" ""You're perfect!"" ""Just don't get any bigger!"" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.",,,,Monica,,
 Honey?,,,,Monica,,
 About that? Erm...I'm going to change.,,,,Monica,,
 I'm going to get bigger!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.",,,,Monica,,
 It's kind of a package deal!,,,,Monica,,
 I thought I was something that we both wanted!,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.",,,,Monica,,
 We're all sorry... (They have a group hug),,,,Monica,,
 Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, you got it!",,,,Monica,,
 Really? If that's what you want...,,,,Monica,,
 Damn it! Rookie mistake!,,,,Monica,,
" Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... (reads from the screen) ""gay as the day is long""?",,,,Monica,,
 But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. (Phone rings),,,,Monica,,
" (On the phone) Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.",,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing?,,,,Monica,,
 Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?,,,,Monica,,
" What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. (pause) Give me your phone.",,,,Monica,,
 And now your cell.,,,,Monica,,
 This is your cellphone?,,,,Monica,,
 This is your current cellphone?,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, where's your purse?",,,,Monica,,
" No, no! Give it to me!",,,,Monica,,
 Give it to me!,,,,Monica,,
 I'll go in there.,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe come here,,,,Monica,,
 Haha!,,,,Monica,,
 Haha!,,,,Monica,,
" So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.",,,,Monica,,
 Who's that? (goes to open door),,,,Monica,,
 (To Mike) What are you doing here?,,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe!,,,,Monica,,
 Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?,,,,Monica,,
 Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!,,,,Monica,,
 (to Mike) This doesn't concern you!!,,,,Monica,,
" Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.",,,,Monica,,
" Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend (to Phoebe) and Mike's friend (Mike is sceptical).",,,,Monica,,
 Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them),,,,Monica,,
 I've been pretty good!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!,,,,Monica,,
" You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!",,,,Monica,,
" Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.",,,,Monica,,
" (running back into the room) Kiss him, you fool!!",,,,Monica,,
 Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!,,,,Monica,,
" Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!",,,,Monica,,
 Excuse me?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.",,,,Monica,,
 You didn't hear the speech!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!",,,,Monica,,
 You're... weird!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)!,,,,Monica,,
 Damn it!,,,,Monica,,
 And I blame you too.,,,,Monica,,
" Hi, glad you could come.",,,,Monica,,
" So, did you know Ross well?",,,,Monica,,
" (a bit surprised) Yes, he is. Me.",,,,Monica,,
 I look like a man??,,,,Monica,,
 You are married though.,,,,Monica,,
 Ok.,,,,Monica,,
 But ehm...what is it not?,,,,Monica,,
 And what else is it not?,,,,Monica,,
 Very good! (Gives him the keys) What do you need it for anyway?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.",,,,Monica,,
 How do you know she's gonna start talking?,,,,Monica,,
 God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?,,,,Monica,,
 (smiling)That was a good day!,,,,Monica,,
 I'm parked in a garage on Morton!,,,,Monica,,
" (to Ross)So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.",,,,Monica,,
" Alright, who wants to do it?",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, hey Rach?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?",,,,Monica,,
" Right! .. but we ""know"" what you're wishing for!",,,,Monica,,
" I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?",,,,Monica,,
" You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.",,,,Monica,,
" Because I know that you think the lottery is ""boohaki"" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!",,,,Monica,,
" Come on, lottery!! (everybody cheers)",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? (doesn't let them answer) Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.",,,,Monica,,
" I'm sorry, idea time is over.",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
 There are no tickets on the nightstand!,,,,Monica,,
" Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, sense the tone!!",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!",,,,Monica,,
 When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!,,,,Monica,,
" Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!",,,,Monica,,
 Ahhh! (shocked),,,,Monica,,
 There's the man I married!!,,,,Monica,,
" Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!",,,,Monica,,
" No, no! We should divide them up (picks up the bowl) and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!",,,,Monica,,
 Money! (they all look at her) Friends...,,,,Monica,,
 They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to Phoebe)...,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, we lost half of them.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, play them!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh God, I am so sorry honey...",,,,Monica,,
" (she hugs Chandler) Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.",,,,Monica,,
 (she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants) 131! (they kiss),,,,Monica,,
" We are on a roll, people!!",,,,Monica,,
 Check your numbers! Make me rich!,,,,Monica,,
 Make me rich!!,,,,Monica,,
" Just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) No!",,,,Monica,,
 (answering phone) Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!",,,,Monica,,
 You bet! No TV or anything! (she gets up from the sofa and goes to the kitchen area),,,,Monica,,
 Let me see!,,,,Monica,,
 You know what? You can have mine.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?",,,,Monica,,
 Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.",,,,Monica,,
 Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!,,,,Monica,,
 Why don't you take Ross?,,,,Monica,,
" No, not if their room has two beds!",,,,Monica,,
 Thank you!,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) You haven't said anything...,,,,Monica,,
 Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.,,,,Monica,,
 What musician?,,,,Monica,,
 What are you doing here!,,,,Monica,,
 Great!,,,,Monica,,
 Listen Phoebe...,,,,Monica,,
" You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...",,,,Monica,,
 This is kind of a classy place.,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
" Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.",,,,Monica,,
" Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?",,,,Monica,,
 What do you think brought than on?,,,,Monica,,
 A love scene? With who?,,,,Monica,,
" Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important.",,,,Monica,,
" I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.",,,,Monica,,
" Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.",,,,Monica,,
 It was hard!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.",,,,Monica,,
 I didn't say your songs were not good enough.,,,,Monica,,
 Tiny portions?,,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, it's not about quantity.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.",,,,Monica,,
" You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.",,,,Monica,,
" Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, you have to stop playing now.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!",,,,Monica,,
" (to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands)",,,,Monica,,
" Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again).",,,,Monica,,
 Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands),,,,Monica,,
 Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand),,,,Monica,,
 I'm sorry...,,,,Monica,,
 ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?,,,,Monica,,
 (without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty!,,,,Monica,,
 It sounds interesting!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah.,,,,Monica,,
" No, I don't think it ever works. Why?",,,,Monica,,
" No, no, Rachel?",,,,Monica,,
 Who do you wanna fool around with?,,,,Monica,,
 (whispering) You can't!,,,,Monica,,
 In the hall.,,,,Monica,,
 You wanna fool around with Joey?,,,,Monica,,
 Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?,,,,Monica,,
" Who, who are they?",,,,Monica,,
 Both of them?,,,,Monica,,
 Which one?,,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.",,,,Monica,,
 What the hell are you cooking!,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 What's so bad about that?,,,,Monica,,
 (fingering her elbow): Ross?,,,,Monica,,
 (to Chandler) Is he gonna introduce us?,,,,Monica,,
 (to chandler) Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.,,,,Monica,,
" (to Ross) So, did you two have fun?",,,,Monica,,
 And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud) HOTTY!! (Charlie looks at her) HI!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?",,,,Monica,,
 You're not sick!,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??",,,,Monica,,
 You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, what is this?",,,,Monica,,
 (aloud) WHAT?,,,,Monica,,
 Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!,,,,Monica,,
 The game's over! Take off your robe!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!,,,,Monica,,
 (Yells after him) I love you!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.,,,,Monica,,
" (Excited) Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.",,,,Monica,,
 (Shocked) Oh my God! Chandler!,,,,Monica,,
" (to Rachel) Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this ""best wishes"" crap. I want ""love"".",,,,Monica,,
 Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!,,,,Monica,,
 (yelling after him) We will!!,,,,Monica,,
 (to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys!,,,,Monica,,
 I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?,,,,Monica,,
 Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather),,,,Monica,,
" That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so).",,,,Monica,,
" Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.",,,,Monica,,
 You really liked it?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh really!,,,,Monica,,
 No!,,,,Monica,,
 So I got it when I was 13...,,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.",,,,Monica,,
 That's different! I was drunk and stupid!,,,,Monica,,
 What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?,,,,Monica,,
 Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.,,,,Monica,,
 And I can't stop you.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you're so wonderful.",,,,Monica,,
" It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.",,,,Monica,,
" Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, what's this?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.",,,,Monica,,
 Do you wanna go hunting?,,,,Monica,,
" And she wants to go hunting, too!!",,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hey honey! I missed you today!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah. (they kiss) What d'you wanna do tonight?,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.",,,,Monica,,
 What is the big deal?,,,,Monica,,
 It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?,,,,Monica,,
" Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!",,,,Monica,,
 (really embarrassed) OH!,,,,Monica,,
" Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?",,,,Monica,,
" I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!",,,,Monica,,
 This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! (leaves),,,,Monica,,
" So, what's your name?",,,,Monica,,
 Hey sweetie.,,,,Monica,,
" With good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) Of course it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) ""Doctor Connelly just called"". If it was good news you would have said (excitedly) ""Doctor Connelly just called! "" But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh... what does that mean?,,,,Monica,,
 Chandler?,,,,Monica,,
 (weeping) Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
 I'm sorry too.,,,,Monica,,
 (still weeping) I know.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!",,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
 Ok.,,,,Monica,,
" Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",,,,Monica,,
 (long pause) Ok.,,,,Monica,,
 Hi honey!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!",,,,Monica,,
 I got it.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I guess.",,,,Monica,,
 (turns around and she's quite shocked) Excuse me?,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! ""Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm""!",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler!,,,,Monica,,
 I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!,,,,Monica,,
 Uh!,,,,Monica,,
" Tell me about yourself, Zack!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey guys! Dinner's ready!,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!",,,,Monica,,
 I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?",,,,Monica,,
" Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?",,,,Monica,,
 We're just making conversation. (Chandler makes an agreeing-sound),,,,Monica,,
 Yess!! (M & C high-five and Zack looks confused again),,,,Monica,,
 Does seem pretty perfect.,,,,Monica,,
 (pause) No.,,,,Monica,,
" No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.",,,,Monica,,
" No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I'm sure.",,,,Monica,,
 That is so sweet. I love you. (they kiss),,,,Monica,,
 Adoption.,,,,Monica,,
 I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.,,,,Monica,,
" So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?",,,,Monica,,
" (excitedly) Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!",,,,Monica,,
" And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there (they go look through the window) our baby could be being conceived.",,,,Monica,,
" David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.",,,,Monica,,
 (to Chandler) See?,,,,Monica,,
" Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.",,,,Monica,,
 (pinching her) Let's get you out of here!! (they go outside),,,,Monica,,
 At least you took me down with you!,,,,Monica,,
" I guess, in time.",,,,Monica,,
" I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.",,,,Monica,,
 Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.",,,,Monica,,
 What? (looks very shocked) Why?,,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?",,,,Monica,,
" They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.",,,,Monica,,
" Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!",,,,Monica,,
" (to Chandler) Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!",,,,Monica,,
 (shouts to Chandler) And make sure our room isn't next to theirs (points to Phoebe).,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, right!",,,,Monica,,
 Ok!,,,,Monica,,
 See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?,,,,Monica,,
 Ok fine. I'll handle this. (goes to Phoebe who's talking to Rachel) Phoebe?,,,,Monica,,
 (looking very serious) I need to talk to you.,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.",,,,Monica,,
 What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?,,,,Monica,,
 Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole ""I never want to get married"" thing and step up!",,,,Monica,,
" This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say ""yes"" but I know she really wants to be with you!",,,,Monica,,
" I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair! (Tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, in vain)",,,,Monica,,
" You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? (Mike hangs up the phone) Damnit!",,,,Monica,,
" (sarcastically) Well, I hope you're happy!",,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe is going to say ""Yes"" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!",,,,Monica,,
" No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!",,,,Monica,,
" No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!",,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.",,,,Monica,,
 IT'S THE HUMIDITY!,,,,Monica,,
" You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? (Phoebe looks very flattered) Now, I don't actually have a ring...",,,,Monica,,
 (to everybody) BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?,,,,Monica,,
 I know (she snuggles to him),,,,Monica,,
 The sun is out!,,,,Monica,,
" Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.",,,,Monica,,
 Damn it!,,,,Monica,,
 Yeah!,,,,Monica,,
" (her hair bigger then before) I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!",,,,Monica,,
" So, what are we gonna do today?",,,,Monica,,
" (pleasantly surprised) Ping pong? (to Chandler) Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!",,,,Monica,,
 (disappointed) Why not?,,,,Monica,,
 I'm not always that bad!,,,,Monica,,
 (hesitatingly) I punched you...?,,,,Monica,,
 ... Phoebe...?,,,,Monica,,
 I clunked your heads together!,,,,Monica,,
" C'mon guys, it'll be fun!",,,,Monica,,
 But then how do we know who wins?,,,,Monica,,
" So, we're just four losers... SUPER!",,,,Monica,,
 (smiling) OK!,,,,Monica,,
 Sure! Got to!,,,,Monica,,
 Aww!,,,,Monica,,
" Hell, yeah!",,,,Monica,,
 How much were you thinking?,,,,Monica,,
 Make it fifty!,,,,Monica,,
 (nearly shouting) One thousand...,,,,Monica,,
 (going through her pockets) No... (to Chandler and Phoebe) Either of you girls got a quarter?,,,,Monica,,
" Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!",,,,Monica,,
" (angry) Ow, what are the chances!",,,,Monica,,
 Ha! My point!,,,,Monica,,
" Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!",,,,Monica,,
" Ah, yeah!",,,,Monica,,
" Ah, yeaaah!",,,,Monica,,
 AH YEAAAAH!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, damn it!",,,,Monica,,
" (threatening) Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?",,,,Monica,,
" NO, NO, NOOO!",,,,Monica,,
 Best out of three?,,,,Monica,,
" (to Mike) Serve the ball, chump!",,,,Monica,,
" No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!",,,,Monica,,
 I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!,,,,Monica,,
" Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!",,,,Monica,,
 That's just good sense!,,,,Monica,,
" (in pain) Aww! (she holds her hand, moaning like she's biting back a scream)",,,,Monica,,
" No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! (she shakes the wrist and it's more painful) Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! (pause) Oh my God! I can't play!",,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe it! (pause) I lost!,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" (to Chandler) Honey, you don't have to do this.",,,,Monica,,
 But... you suck!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! You're good!,,,,Monica,,
 (to Chandler) Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you (pause) Hold on! I almost forgot (she turns to Mike) loser! (back to Chandler) When did you stop sucking?,,,,Monica,,
 Why?,,,,Monica,,
 This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...? (plays with her finger on Chandlers chest)",,,,Monica,,
 I'll put a pillowcase over my head.,,,,Monica,,
 What's up?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.",,,,Monica,,
" Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, that's Charlie!",,,,Monica,,
 I'm not sure about this.,,,,Monica,,
 No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" (in her Monica-excited-way... TOO LOUD!) Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!",,,,Monica,,
 (muffled) Thank you.,,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?,,,,Monica,,
 I'm on it!,,,,Monica,,
 I think I hear curtains closing...,,,,Monica,,
" Bedsprings, unmistakable!",,,,Monica,,
" Not until you said it. Somebody switch! (Chandler makes a clicking sound with his fingers and Phoebe runs to the other wall. Monica returns to Chandlers wall.) Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.",,,,Monica,,
" Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!",,,,Monica,,
" (also hugs the wall) Yeah, we had a great time, thank you! (walks to Phoebe)",,,,Monica,,
" Other wall, people! Other wall!",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?",,,,Monica,,
 Check it out!,,,,Monica,,
 What do you think?,,,,Monica,,
 Don't you just love it?,,,,Monica,,
 And listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells tingle),,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) Ow!",,,,Monica,,
 Yeah!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. (she pushes Chandler on the couch and brushes her hair and shells against Chandler's chest) You like that, right? (again, she brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)",,,,Monica,,
" It's ""Bolero"" from ""10"".",,,,Monica,,
 You what? You said you liked them.,,,,Monica,,
" Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.",,,,Monica,,
" You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... (and she shakes her head more violently) OUCH!",,,,Monica,,
 And the eye!,,,,Monica,,
 Not really.,,,,Monica,,
 I have a problem.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, I was dancing around, and singing ""No Woman, No Cry"" and I got stuck.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, well, I can move... (she moves back and forth the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair as she goes)",,,,Monica,,
 (looking disappointed) I guess so...,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.",,,,Monica,,
 Look what I found in the drawer... (Chandler looks up from his book.) And you said I'd never wear this...,,,,Monica,,
" Sure, what do you have in mind?",,,,Monica,,
 Really? I don't really feel like it.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.",,,,Monica,,
" God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
 That's sweet. Drink your hair.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.",,,,Monica,,
 That's not really how it works.,,,,Monica,,
 I don't know!,,,,Monica,,
" Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?",,,,Monica,,
 Hi Frank.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!",,,,Monica,,
 Which one is which again?,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh my god!,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you. (To Chandler.) I think I just had a tiny orgasm.,,,,Monica,,
 It's.. It's just so pretty and white.,,,,Monica,,
 Can I adopt you?,,,,Monica,,
 They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?,,,,Monica,,
 Why? What did you do in the bathroom?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Phoebs",,,,Monica,,
" Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 (to Chandler) Hey sweetie! (they kiss),,,,Monica,,
 Chandler gets pedicures!,,,,Monica,,
 There. Here's their card.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey Phoebe!,,,,Monica,,
" I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!",,,,Monica,,
" She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. (she apes Amanda using an awful British accent) ""Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!""",,,,Monica,,
 (pause) (to Phoebe) Chandler gets pedicures!,,,,Monica,,
" I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! (to Chandler) Have you ever done that?",,,,Monica,,
" (to Phoebe) No, no, don’t get it. Let the machine pick up.",,,,Monica,,
 It could be Amanda!,,,,Monica,,
 You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!,,,,Monica,,
" We weren’t picking up, it’s Amanda!",,,,Monica,,
" Hi Amanda! Actually now... it’s... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? (Phoebe mouths 'no') Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldn’t say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!",,,,Monica,,
 And you would?,,,,Monica,,
" How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!",,,,Monica,,
 One Two Three...,,,,Monica,,
" Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.",,,,Monica,,
" (sees what he is doing) Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey Phoebe!,,,,Monica,,
 Is Amanda here yet?,,,,Monica,,
" (sits down) Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?",,,,Monica,,
 Hi!,,,,Monica,,
 (beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...,,,,Monica,,
 When were we not friends?,,,,Monica,,
" Ehm, we were friends in 1992.",,,,Monica,,
 (To Phoebe) You were going to cut me out?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh My God!,,,,Monica,,
" (Into the phone) Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more) Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)",,,,Monica,,
 Nope! (She turns and leaves),,,,Monica,,
 We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.,,,,Monica,,
 I have nothing to say to you.,,,,Monica,,
" I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?",,,,Monica,,
 I'm still all those things!,,,,Monica,,
 (starts smiling) I am scrappy.,,,,Monica,,
 It's because I'm scrappy.,,,,Monica,,
 I won't know what I would do without you.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.",,,,Monica,,
 (she enters) Hey guys!,,,,Monica,,
 That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.",,,,Monica,,
" Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!,,,,Monica,,
" Are you freaking kidding me, Green?",,,,Monica,,
 So glad you came!,,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe Emma is still asleep!,,,,Monica,,
 I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!",,,,Monica,,
" We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!",,,,Monica,,
" Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.",,,,Monica,,
" Alright, 5 more minutes.",,,,Monica,,
 No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us (Points at herself and Chandler) We've been complaining the longest!,,,,Monica,,
" No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!",,,,Monica,,
 No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.,,,,Monica,,
" (She gives Joey a you-are-so-stupid-look) Ok, ten.",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!",,,,Monica,,
 Everybody get your toys! (They all run toward the table with toys),,,,Monica,,
" Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go (Takes two cups and marks the start and finish lines with them) from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!",,,,Monica,,
 (to the dog) What are you barking at?,,,,Monica,,
 Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?,,,,Monica,,
" No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. (turns to Chandler) The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...",,,,Monica,,
" Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.",,,,Monica,,
 Game?,,,,Monica,,
 That's how old you are.,,,,Monica,,
" (embraces Emma tightly) Ooh, I want one...",,,,Monica,,
 ...and head to Canada!,,,,Monica,,
 I wasn't. Let's get going!,,,,Monica,,
 What about your massage client?,,,,Monica,,
 Thanks!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.",,,,Monica,,
 Thank you!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much ""with the words"".",,,,Monica,,
 Clearly we were wrong.,,,,Monica,,
" You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.",,,,Monica,,
 Wow! Don't you look nice?!,,,,Monica,,
 You guys do that? Chandler won't even have s*x in our bathroom!,,,,Monica,,
 (also reading it) It doesn’t make any sense.,,,,Monica,,
" Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to Joey)",,,,Monica,,
" Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-what’s-wrong-with-that' look). Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?",,,,Monica,,
" Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!",,,,Monica,,
" I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright, moving on...",,,,Monica,,
 Thank you.,,,,Monica,,
" How about at a game, on the big screen?",,,,Monica,,
" What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!",,,,Monica,,
" No, sorry sweety..",,,,Monica,,
 You dropped it off?,,,,Monica,,
 You hand-wrote it?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!",,,,Monica,,
 Okay good.,,,,Monica,,
" Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 (surprised) They thought Joey was a child?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, what did you guys do today?",,,,Monica,,
 Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.,,,,Monica,,
" I'm a cool, fun aunt!",,,,Monica,,
 What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, right.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!",,,,Monica,,
" Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?",,,,Monica,,
 Who's Gladys? (Phoebe shows her a horrific painting with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of the frame. Monica's frightened and she gasps.) Oh! What a tragic loss!,,,,Monica,,
" (faking happiness) Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...",,,,Monica,,
" Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!",,,,Monica,,
" Absolutely! Yes, you say to him ""I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!""",,,,Monica,,
" Damn it, I did not think this through!",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?",,,,Monica,,
" Wow, what's the bad news!",,,,Monica,,
 Huh!,,,,Monica,,
" You know, I would give her up, for you.",,,,Monica,,
 But I want to.,,,,Monica,,
 But I insist!,,,,Monica,,
" No, that landed in your food!",,,,Monica,,
" (faking happiness) Oh, my!",,,,Monica,,
" (sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to do) I haven't really settled on a spot yet!",,,,Monica,,
 (offended) I like that poster!,,,,Monica,,
 (Impatient with Rachel) Are you still here?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey! I sold that to Joey.,,,,Monica,,
" No, too late. You can't give it back! (she pushes the painting back to Rachel)",,,,Monica,,
 No you can't. She's yours!,,,,Monica,,
 SHE'S YOURS!,,,,Monica,,
 She's m-i-i-ne!,,,,Monica,,
 She's mine!,,,,Monica,,
 She's mine!,,,,Monica,,
 She's mine!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
 (sarcastically) We?,,,,Monica,,
" And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... p0rn or cigarettes?",,,,Monica,,
 Chandler?,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?",,,,Monica,,
 It isn't mine!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!",,,,Monica,,
 Ok.,,,,Monica,,
" We’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad you’re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this (she puts a box on the table and opens it). I don’t know if you wanna use it, but…",,,,Monica,,
 I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!,,,,Monica,,
 That’s crazy! (Phoebe looks bewildered). I am sorry. I just can’t imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!,,,,Monica,,
" That’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?",,,,Monica,,
" Ow! (Chandler slaps her on her back) Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!",,,,Monica,,
 Yay!,,,,Monica,,
" Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!",,,,Monica,,
" Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.",,,,Monica,,
 Would you like something to drink?,,,,Monica,,
 Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited about getting this process started.,,,,Monica,,
" Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.",,,,Monica,,
 Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before,,,,Monica,,
 Really? What is it?,,,,Monica,,
 Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?,,,,Monica,,
 Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture,",,,,Monica,,
 (Pulls Laura into the spare room) Why don't I show you the baby's room?,,,,Monica,,
 So that was the baby's room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey behind,,,,Monica,,
 (To Chandler) What room should we see next?,,,,Monica,,
" (laughs nervously as well, Laura looks confused) (To Laura) Some people don't",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.",,,,Monica,,
" Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye. (hangs up)",,,,Monica,,
 It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.,,,,Monica,,
 Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...,,,,Monica,,
 Hey guys!,,,,Monica,,
 We need to talk to you about something.,,,,Monica,,
" No, it's not!",,,,Monica,,
" Thank you, Pheebs!",,,,Monica,,
" What? You are way off, lady!",,,,Monica,,
" That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!",,,,Monica,,
" You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?",,,,Monica,,
" No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.",,,,Monica,,
" 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.",,,,Monica,,
" This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year ""me""!",,,,Monica,,
 (Chandler's laughing) Did someone drop the baton again?,,,,Monica,,
 (she tastes what she has cooked) I don't get older. I just get better!,,,,Monica,,
 You don't know that.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!",,,,Monica,,
 Name one of his books.,,,,Monica,,
" Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these (she gives Chandler a bowl with cranberries. Then, while she's going outside, she sees him with a bottle of soap in his hands) Not with soap!! (she leaves)",,,,Monica,,
 Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!,,,,Monica,,
 Do you hear something? (Chandlers stands up and goes to the door to look out from the peephole),,,,Monica,,
" Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!",,,,Monica,,
 (gasps) Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!,,,,Monica,,
 No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.,,,,Monica,,
 (Rolling her eyes) Nothing. It's fine.,,,,Monica,,
 That's all the turkey you're gonna get.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.",,,,Monica,,
 Stinky?!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.",,,,Monica,,
" (Gets up) Okay, okay. You two (to Phoebe and Rachel) go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?",,,,Monica,,
 Grand Supreme Little Darling?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.",,,,Monica,,
 It's too late for apologies.,,,,Monica,,
 The three of us?,,,,Monica,,
" Joey, that is not gonna work.",,,,Monica,,
" Alright, well, this does not change anything. (to Chandler) Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.",,,,Monica,,
 Bring it.,,,,Monica,,
 Here you go!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, try it.",,,,Monica,,
" Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.",,,,Monica,,
" Chandler, where are your tools?",,,,Monica,,
" I do, but Rachel borrowed them.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh!,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.",,,,Monica,,
 (very emotional) I don't care.,,,,Monica,,
 That was the adoption agency...,,,,Monica,,
 WE'RE GETTING A BABY!,,,,Monica,,
" There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!",,,,Monica,,
 This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!,,,,Monica,,
" I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby. (she kisses Chandler)",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
" Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.",,,,Monica,,
 She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.,,,,Monica,,
 And a lot could still get in our way.,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!,,,,Monica,,
" You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and (to Chandler) you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! {she leaves)",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, thank you.(the man leaves) Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?",,,,Monica,,
" Uh, we're gonna be great.",,,,Monica,,
 Well... obviously!,,,,Monica,,
" Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.",,,,Monica,,
 I don't know about that.,,,,Monica,,
" (overlapping) Let her finish, doctor.",,,,Monica,,
 Amen.,,,,Monica,,
" Uh, good hands. (she holds Chandler hands) Healing hands.",,,,Monica,,
 It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.",,,,Monica,,
 We don’t?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! (to Chandler, who looks bewildered). Did you hear that?",,,,Monica,,
" (to Erica) Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. (they hugs). You are SO going to Heaven!",,,,Monica,,
 Why not?,,,,Monica,,
 God works in mysterious ways.,,,,Monica,,
 But she liked us.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor. (looks very convinced about what she just said)",,,,Monica,,
" C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.",,,,Monica,,
 (very emotional) Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.,,,,Monica,,
" I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?",,,,Monica,,
" (Almost crying) Please.. please, we are so close.",,,,Monica,,
" (realizes Chandler is right. She's almost crying) okay, right. (They hug)",,,,Monica,,
 (sniffing) Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?,,,,Monica,,
 Technicality!,,,,Monica,,
 (pointing to a picture on the table) I-Is... Is that a picture?,,,,Monica,,
" Look, doctor!",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. (holds up the sonogram)",,,,Monica,,
" Well, we... (makes quotation signs in the air) ""bore false witness""... See I could be a reverend.",,,,Monica,,
 But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...,,,,Monica,,
" Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...",,,,Monica,,
 God bless you Chandler Bing!,,,,Monica,,
 (really excited) Mmh... this cake is amazing!,,,,Monica,,
 I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!,,,,Monica,,
 (with no hesitation) s*x!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said ""s*x"" I wasn't thinking about ""s*x with you""!",,,,Monica,,
 Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.,,,,Monica,,
 Nancy doesn’t smoke!,,,,Monica,,
 So? What do you think of the house?,,,,Monica,,
 Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?,,,,Monica,,
 Don’t you love the huge yard?,,,,Monica,,
" And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!",,,,Monica,,
 So? Do you think we should get it?,,,,Monica,,
 I think we should.,,,,Monica,,
 This is huge!,,,,Monica,,
" How bad you wanna smoke, right now.",,,,Monica,,
 Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?,,,,Monica,,
 Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.,,,,Monica,,
 If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!,,,,Monica,,
" No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... (to the rest) Did you think the neighborhood was homey? (Chandler enters)",,,,Monica,,
 (goes to Chandler) Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.,,,,Monica,,
" (turns to them) Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.",,,,Monica,,
" Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.",,,,Monica,,
" When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.",,,,Monica,,
" And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...",,,,Monica,,
" And about an hour ago, we made an offer.",,,,Monica,,
 (smiling) It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... (gets cut off),,,,Monica,,
" We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. (Points to Rachel and Phoebe) It is beautiful, isn't it?",,,,Monica,,
" Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.",,,,Monica,,
 Every year.,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?",,,,Monica,,
" I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?",,,,Monica,,
 Deal!,,,,Monica,,
 Maurice.,,,,Monica,,
" It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.",,,,Monica,,
 That’s not even a word!,,,,Monica,,
 NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!",,,,Monica,,
 (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?,,,,Monica,,
" I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.",,,,Monica,,
" Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, ""What were you thinking?""",,,,Monica,,
" Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.",,,,Monica,,
" When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.",,,,Monica,,
" When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.",,,,Monica,,
" And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)",,,,Monica,,
 She really left.,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you.,,,,Monica,,
 Can I ask you a question?,,,,Monica,,
 What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.),,,,Monica,,
 And?,,,,Monica,,
 We can't afford that.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, there you go.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, we'll be okay.",,,,Monica,,
" I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God!,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?,,,,Monica,,
 And a baby...,,,,Monica,,
 We sure are.,,,,Monica,,
 (quickly) Not it!,,,,Monica,,
" Rachel, this is yours.",,,,Monica,,
" All right, everybody open them!",,,,Monica,,
 I know.,,,,Monica,,
 Enjoy!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, let me tell them!",,,,Monica,,
 Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!,,,,Monica,,
" (stopping Joey from answering) Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!",,,,Monica,,
" Or ""Win, Lose or Draw"".",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.",,,,Monica,,
 Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.",,,,Monica,,
" (singing) ""I'm a little bit country""...",,,,Monica,,
" (to Rachel) Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!",,,,Monica,,
 Who is it?,,,,Monica,,
" What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad? (looks over to Phoebe and she opens the door, and to their dismay, the stripper is an old, short, fat guy who looks exhausted)",,,,Monica,,
" Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...",,,,Monica,,
 ...If-you-say-so.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!",,,,Monica,,
" (walks towards Phoebe and the stripper) Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...",,,,Monica,,
 I can't believe we are at a real college party! (Rachel laughs excitedly) I have to pee so bad!,,,,Monica,,
" Hey, you've got a boyfriend!",,,,Monica,,
" Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!",,,,Monica,,
 I KNOW!,,,,Monica,,
 Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you (rolls her eyes) NOT. (she and Rachel giggle a little and Chandler looks unimpressed),,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.,,,,Monica,,
 Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.,,,,Monica,,
 That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all. (Chandler approaches),,,,Monica,,
" For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing. (A guy enters holding a pizza box)",,,,Monica,,
 Oh THATS ME! (she runs to the pizza guy),,,,Monica,,
 She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.,,,,Monica,,
 What? When was this?,,,,Monica,,
 Oh my God! That's wild!,,,,Monica,,
" Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.",,,,Monica,,
" (screeching) OH! Oh, oh! (holding her hand in front of her mouth)",,,,Monica,,
" YES! (Chandler gets an ""oh no!"" look on his face)",,,,Monica,,
 I was the pile of coats!,,,,Monica,,
 You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?,,,,Monica,,
 You were my first kiss ever?,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, crap!",,,,Monica,,
" (she enters with a headset on and she's speaking into the microphone) Well, it matters to me!",,,,Monica,,
" Did you just hung up on me? (she hangs up too) All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.",,,,Monica,,
 You don't know military time?,,,,Monica,,
 Just subtract twelve.,,,,Monica,,
 (screaming) Six o'clock!,,,,Monica,,
" Ok. Hold on. (her mobile phone rings) Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. (she hangs up) Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?",,,,Monica,,
" Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.",,,,Monica,,
 Ooh... she backed out.,,,,Monica,,
" I made her. (Phoebe looks shocked) Steel drums don't really say ""elegant wedding"". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.",,,,Monica,,
" (coming) Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time! (she takes off)",,,,Monica,,
" (looking at Phoebe eating something) Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!",,,,Monica,,
" Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!",,,,Monica,,
" Ok, it's 2100 hours. (to Phoebe) Time for your toast. (Mike appears)",,,,Monica,,
" You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! (to Phoebe and Mike). Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!",,,,Monica,,
" (very serious) It's 2101 and I am not amused. (pause). Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. (Everyone sits and Phoebe gets up)",,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
" Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages. (hands her a stack of papers with messages and calls to return)",,,,Monica,,
" Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.",,,,Monica,,
 Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.,,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,
" She's in her room, why?",,,,Monica,,
 I know.,,,,Monica,,
 Bye.,,,,Monica,,
" (Obviously enjoying this setback) Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. (by now she can barely keep herself from smiling) Uh! What a pickle.",,,,Monica,,
 (enjoying what she's seeing) How's it going?,,,,Monica,,
 What?,,,,Monica,,
 (Sounds moved) Really?,,,,Monica,,
 You really want me to come back?,,,,Monica,,
" Ok people, we are back in business! (Gets her headset out of her purse) Oh God, we've missed you soo much! (takes all the notes from Phoebe) Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.",,,,Monica,,
 Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!,,,,Monica,,
" (Putting down her phone) Well, the club lost it's power.",,,,Monica,,
 (thinking) AFFIRMATIVE!,,,,Monica,,
" (walking around with her headset still on) OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. (He does so and the lights above the chairs light up. Monica looks satisfied) Okay, who left the ice sculpture (picks up a piece of ice from the ground) ON THE STEAM GRATE? (nobody answers)",,,,Monica,,
" Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.",,,,Monica,,
 Really?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me. (they walk off, Ross looks down to Chappy, who he's holding and he gets a whiff of the dog's smell. He is clearly disgusted by it.)",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.",,,,Monica,,
" So, you're ready to do this?",,,,Monica,,
" I love you. (Phoebe leans in to kiss her.) Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell. (the girls hug)",,,,Monica,,
 Okay. (in her microphone) It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. (to all) Let's get this bad boy on the road.,,,,Monica,,
 (checking her clipboard) I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay Marjorie, hit it.",,,,Monica,,
" Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? (into microphone) We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! (realizes) Oh, that's me.",,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, you really shouldn't. (to Ross, sarcastically) By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?",,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey.,,,,Monica,,
" No, we haven't seen her since this morning.",,,,Monica,,
 Hey!,,,,Monica,,
 These are for Erica!,,,,Monica,,
" Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!",,,,Monica,,
" Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...",,,,Monica,,
" Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?",,,,Monica,,
 Honey.,,,,Monica,,
 (entering with Erica and Chandler) Hey you guys.,,,,Monica,,
" I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!",,,,Monica,,
" Joey. Erica, baby!",,,,Monica,,
" Everyone. Erica, baby!",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.",,,,Monica,,
 What is with you?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.,,,,Monica,,
 How's that now?,,,,Monica,,
 Was he falsely accused of something? (They look hopeful),,,,Monica,,
 Are you awake?,,,,Monica,,
" Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.",,,,Monica,,
" Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?",,,,Monica,,
 How?,,,,Monica,,
" Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.",,,,Monica,,
" Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.",,,,Monica,,
 (smiling) No it's not.,,,,Monica,,
 The thing we never do.,,,,Monica,,
" Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.",,,,Monica,,
" Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.",,,,Monica,,
" No one wanted seconds, right?",,,,Monica,,
 I don't know who I'm happiest for...,,,,Monica,,
" No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this. (pats Chandler on his leg)",,,,Monica,,
 Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...,,,,Monica,,
 I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.,,,,Monica,,
" All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.",,,,Monica,,
" Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.",,,,Monica,,
 See you guys later.,,,,Monica,,
 (to Joey) I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.,,,,Monica,,
 Hey Pheebs.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.",,,,Monica,,
 Phoebe!,,,,Monica,,
 You seriously changed your name to that?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?",,,,Monica,,
 Oh God. I'm so sorry.,,,,Monica,,
 But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you for letting us see the house again.,,,,Monica,,
" Ah, so glad you decided to come.",,,,Monica,,
 No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.,,,,Monica,,
 Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.,,,,Monica,,
 No it's not!,,,,Monica,,
" Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.",,,,Monica,,
" Joey, we know that's you.",,,,Monica,,
" Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, where have you been?",,,,Monica,,
" Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?",,,,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,
 I guess. Why? Who's she with?,,,,Monica,,
" So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.",,,,Monica,,
 Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.,,,,Monica,,
" Oh, sorry!",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...",,,,Monica,,
" I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.",,,,Monica,,
 How is that gonna happen?,,,,Monica,,
 You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?,,,,Monica,,
" Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.",,,,Monica,,
 But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?,,,,Monica,,
 That's terrible!,,,,Monica,,
 Joey's gonna be *so* upset.,,,,Monica,,
" Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?",,,,Monica,,
 What if he reads it in the paper?,,,,Monica,,
" Hi. We’re buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.",,,,Monica,,
 Thanks.,,,,Monica,,
" Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!",,,,Monica,,
 Love it!,,,,Monica,,
" They could be our neighbors, what are they like?",,,,Monica,,
" No, actually, we're buying the house next door. (Janice gasps)",,,,Monica,,
 (looks confused and scared) I don't know why.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.",,,,Monica,,
" (Thinks a little more) Okay, Okay, (clapping her hands) All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.",,,,Monica,,
" Okay, you come up with an idea.",,,,Monica,,
 But we love our house.,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body. (She shows this with her index finger, mimicking it pushing something up)",,,,Monica,,
 Mhum.,,,Chandler,Monica,,
 Sure! Alright...,,,Chandler,Monica,,
 No.,,,,Monica,,Rachel
" Okay, I'll try. ",,,,Monica,,
" Hey, Rach, how's it going?",,,,Monica,,
 All right...,,,,Monica,,
" ""Willing to adopt triplets?"" No!",,,,Monica,,
 oh God.,,,,Monica,,
 Why the hell did you take her?,,,,Monica,,
" Okay, listen I know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this.",,,,Monica,,
 No!,,,Chandler,Monica,,
" Three! (They lift up the covers and check each other out, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)",,,Chandler,Monica,,
 Hi Ross.,,,Chandler,Monica,,
" OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! (finally Monica concludes) No!",,,Chandler,Monica,,
 One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.,Joey,,,Monica,,

 Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time!,,,,Monica,,
 Thank you. It was so beautiful. <gets up and walks towards the front door> I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.,,,,Monica,,
 So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're seeing Emma?,,,,Monica,,
 Hey you.,,,,Monica,,
 Hi.,,,,Monica,,

" Oh yeah, I totally agree.",,,Chandler,Monica,Phoebe,Rachel
 Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!,,Ross,Chandler,Monica,,
" [singing] I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...",,,,Monica,Phoebe,
 Yes!,Joey,,,Monica,,Rachel
 It's over/Joe!,,,,Monica,,
 (joining in) Home is Home Star stew.,Joey,Ross,,Monica,,
 Shut up!,,,,Monica,Phoebe,
" More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying—(She is cut off by an exploding shell just outside the tent. When the smoke clears, she's missing an arm and the blood is pumping out like you'd see in a horror movie. And upon seeing her condition, she says…) Oh no.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.",,,,,Phoebe,
" You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.",,,,,Phoebe,
 [to Rachel] What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?,,,,,Phoebe,
" [rhythmically] Uh-huh, uh-huh.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you gonna go over there?,,,,,Phoebe,
 This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Eww, I don't wanna do that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, have a good break-up.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, it was really hard.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, you weren't there.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my god. [Chandler downs another espresso.] How many of those have you had?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.",,,,,Phoebe,
 All right.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wait here. Breathe.,,,,,Phoebe,
 It's like a gift.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I'd like that.",,,,,Phoebe,
 [seeing Rachel's clothes] What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, how'd it go?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, he needed some time to grieve.",,,,,Phoebe,
 That oughta do it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. [plays a chord, then the lights go out] OK, thank you very much.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. [to Monica] What's my number?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I never call me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [at window] Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh... Milwaukee.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, Rachel.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [singing] New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... [she writes the lyrics down]",,,,,Phoebe,
 About what?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What surprise party?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, he didn't tell me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. [Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased] Looks like I was second to last.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [stops at a door] Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?",,,,,Phoebe,
 [trying to hold back the struggling cat] He seems to hate you. Are you sure?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wait a minute. What's his name?,,,,,Phoebe,
 [the cat runs away from her] Oooh! You are a very bad man!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.,,,,,Phoebe,
 [smiling] You betcha!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. [Rachel looks at her] But I won't.",,,,,Phoebe,
" You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... [they stare at her]... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... [time lapse]... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... [someone blows it out, the room gets completely dark]",,,,,Phoebe,
 Thanks.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey guys, guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...",,,,,Phoebe,
 Never mind. But it was going to be really good.,,,,,Phoebe,
 So was it a lot more money?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? [pause] Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hi! [turns back to Chandler, then to Monica] Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I know! [turns to Chandler] Well, what do you think?",,,,,Phoebe,
 OK. [pause] Hey Monica! Guess what!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh! Brian's Song!,,,,,Phoebe,
 [as though Rachel wasn't paying attention] Yummy noises.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh! I know what you could make! [runs over to join Monica and Rachel in the kitchen] I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know. [sits down]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, is this the bug lady?",,,,,Phoebe,
 That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!,,,,,Phoebe,
" [excited] Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! You have a window!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh look! That guy's peeing!,,,,,Phoebe,
 [sitting] OK.,,,,,Phoebe,
" [overemphasizing] Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of [Monica signals her to stop] of, OK, smells.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [whispers] In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?,,,,,Phoebe,
 How's this? [presses down hard],,,,,Phoebe,
 How about over here? [presses down hard again],,,,,Phoebe,
" See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? [presses down elsewhere]",,,,,Phoebe,
" What about this? [she starts using her elbows on his back, he yells in pain]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Did I miss it, did I miss it?",,,,,Phoebe,
" I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing) They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Thanks, Ross.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ok.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing) They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next...[sees Ross and Susan staring at her] la la la la la la.",,,,,Phoebe,
 This is so great.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. [pause] I'm sorry, you were fighting.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [reading the nametag on the uniform] Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.",,,,,Phoebe,
" You guys, he's beautiful!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Susan, he looks just like you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. [screen goes blank] Look, he's opening his eyes. [picture comes back]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!",,,,,Phoebe,
" We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew... [hands meat to Monica]",,,,,Phoebe,
 So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your [provocatively] special someone?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Jeez, you say one thing, and...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, let me see! [takes the picture]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... [puts picture down, sees Ross staring at her] Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the--",,,,,Phoebe,
" So you do know who he is! [laughs, Ross stares at her] Sorry.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Remembered what?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know. This is really, really huge.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Here, look, alright, does this help?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Maybe there's someone else.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. [hugs Chandler but holds her hands apart behind his back] Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [seeing Ross kissing Julie outside the window] Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.",,,,,Phoebe,
" So, I figured it out.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.",,,,,Phoebe,
" You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm. [they hug]",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey Joey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.",,,,,Phoebe,
 And we did.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yay me.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.",,,,,Phoebe,
" He said that, um, he understands how s*x can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, so I said, ""OK, relax please,"" y'know, I mean, s*x can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Um-hum.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a ""I gotta have you now"" kind of thing?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow. What are you gonna use it for?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, well, actually.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, all right.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, ""Two of Them Kissed Last Night"".",,,,,Phoebe,
" [singing] There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What makes it pilgrim?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What were you thinking?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK. [reading] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are... are you OK?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Fun Bobby is so great.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Half full of looooovvvvve.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Cabin of loooooovvvvve.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Two.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, cake.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [comes back to couch, with cake] Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?",,,,,Phoebe,
" [sad] Ooohh, why?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, no.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.",,,,,Phoebe,
 But you guys came so close.,,,,,Phoebe,
 That is funny.,,,,,Phoebe,
 It's not that bad.,,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, OK, don't get all squinky.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Rachel? Um, hi.",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?",,,,,Phoebe,
" [looks at Russ] Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, my, oh!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I, OK....",,,,,Phoebe,
 Bye.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You don't see it? You actually don't see it?,,,,,Phoebe,
" OK honey, you're dating Ross.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!,,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, noone is named Sleeve.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What's with all the bottles of liquor?,,,,,Phoebe,
 So... and?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure.,,,,Monica,Phoebe,
 Ohhhh.,,,,Monica,Phoebe,
" Wait, does he eat chalk?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!",,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh! Oh! (STARTS TO PLUCK AT THE AIR JUST IN FRONT OF ROSS),,,,,Phoebe,
" (SINGS) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (RACHEL AND MONICA TURN TO LOOK AT HER)..bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...",,,,,Phoebe,
 (GRINS AND WALKS TO KITCHEN. TO CHANDLER AND JOEY) I helped!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (SHE MASSAGES THEM)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. ",,,,,Phoebe,
" You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windows outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (SINGS) I can't believe what I'm hearing here...,,,,,Phoebe,
 (SINGS) What I said...,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, was I doing it again?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah! ",,,,,Phoebe,
...Then I've already seen this one! (TURNS OFF TV),,,,,Phoebe,
" She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (MON GIVES HER A LOOK) -but, it's fine!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, it's beautiful.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, look, don't touch that!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Doy! Probably right before she lost it!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (WHILE EVERYONE ELSE IS STUNNED) Ooh! I found it!,,,,,Phoebe,
 She is so great! I miss her.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.",,,,,Phoebe,
 She's a waitress.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (ENTERING) Hi guys!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'",,,,,Phoebe,
" Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-",,,,,Phoebe,
 - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!",,,,,Phoebe,
" 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- (SEARCHES IN HER PURSE) -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! ",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!",,,,,Phoebe,
" From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, Lizzie.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I brought you alphabet soup.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, ""sometimes y"". Uh, I also have something else for you. (SEARCHES IN HER PURSE)",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, that's fine, no.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I'm fine.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Huh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Does, um, anyone wanna see?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.",,,,,Phoebe,
" And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.",,,,,Phoebe,
 There it is!,,,,,Phoebe,
" You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I- (CHEWS HER HAIR)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Did he mention us?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (SHOUTS AS HE LEAVES) If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (WAKING AND STARTLING THEM) Oh! What what what! ...Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I got no sleep last night!,,,,,Phoebe,
" My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Thanks.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (TO MONICA) Look, look, I have elbows! (THEY SCREAM)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You are just like Jack.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, Jack and the Beanstalk.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Floopy?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, like that's a word.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't even have a 'pl'.,,,,,Phoebe,
 And-and a power tie?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Big Bird's friend.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (RUNS UP AND TAKES THE BINOCULARS) ",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Definitely not his mother.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (YELLS) Hey, that's not for you, bitch!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You'd already broken up.,,,,,Phoebe,
 A couple hours.,,,,,Phoebe,
 There he is! There he is!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Right- where we've been looking all night!,,,,,Phoebe,
" The exclamation point in the title scares me. (GESTURING) Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Based on this play? ...Based on this play!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (READING MONICA'S PALM) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (TO RACHEL) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, (PSYCHO) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Seriously, what-what's the part?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I think so, yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, you have homosexual hair.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, that sucks!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? [She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously] Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Thanks!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. [Hands back the pencil]",,,,,Phoebe,
" [Entering] Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What'd I say?,,,,,Phoebe,
" God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You missed a belt loop. ,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, it's in spasm.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh! That's so nice...,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What were you modeling for?,,,,,Phoebe,
" You know, the asthma guy was really cute.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. Oh, can I come?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (stirring pot) Ok, all done.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Almost never.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.,,,,,Phoebe,
 It's nice that he has someone.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?",,,,,Phoebe,
 That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?,,,,,Phoebe,
" So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, you wish!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, oh, good.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [Takes mike] Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. [Shakes bell as an introduction] [Sung:]",,,,,Phoebe,
 [Sung],,,,,Phoebe,
 [Sung],,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Could you speak up please?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, we're gonna take a short break. [Goes over to their table]",,,,,Phoebe,
" David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... ",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, alright, I have a question, then. ",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me. ",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, right now.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. ",,,,,Phoebe,
 I can hop. [She hops onto the table],,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, he hasn't been around.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Minsk?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I know where Minsk is.,,,,,Phoebe,
" So when, when do you leave?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hello?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so [Puts on a fake cheery voice] congratulations! This is so exciting!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you're not going? [Fake disappointed voice] Oh, why?",,,,,Phoebe,
 So-so you're really not going?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh don't do that.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh no no.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, but I can't do that-",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's your thing, and-",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, um, stay.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Stay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Getting so good at that! [She hops on],,,,,Phoebe,
 And then... your face is bloated?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hi, Max!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you alright?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You're going to Minsk.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say [Hits him] 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. [He does so] And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. [They kiss] I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Where? (Turns to face him) Ooh, come to Momma.",,,,,Phoebe,
 We should do something. Whistle.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on, do it.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Do it!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Do it do it do it!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I can't believe you did that!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Maybe nobody's tried this.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey hey hey! She's on!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Your mom was arrested?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What about Glen? He could be a Glen.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh! How about Agamemnon?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm in.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy's hair in the other direction) No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the sheet to reveal him wearing new pajamas.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (Walks up with her guitar) Hey Rach.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hello.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Going to the hospital tonight?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, you?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, maybe it was a trick question. (Plays a few chords) Um, Rachel can we do this now?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. (Monica gives her a look) 'Kay. (Sung:)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, whadyou do with him?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Look at you! How, how do you feel?",,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm Phoebe Buffay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, we both have.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, actually it's just from me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You know who shaved you? That was me.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I sang. (To Monica) Hah!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You're welcome.,,,,,Phoebe,
" What, that's it?",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't think you mean that.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. (Joey grimaces)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (softly) Sorry. (Camera pans back to Monica, still on phone)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, thanks. (assistant leaves, then walks back in)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, Racquela's right, yeah!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Fine!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, you know Paolo?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, he made a move on me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until. (A flashback starts Paolo, lying on massage table, moving his hands up Phoebe's legs.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, I'm sure. (Flashback resumes with Phoebe doing a voiceover.) And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (Flashback continues: Paolo rolls over, Phoebe looks down, then quickly looks up, bites lip, shakes her head)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uma Thurman.,,,,,Phoebe,
 She is gonna hate me.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you moving out?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! (sits down) Ok, um, ok, um,",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, um, (clears throat) we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. (Phoebe opens a tin and offers Rachel a cookie)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies",,,,,Phoebe,
 Which proves that I never lie.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Paolo made a pass at me.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you okay?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, I've got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup) Here you go... (Rachel drinks straight from thermos) Oh!(Rachel finishes thermos) Better?",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Such a pig!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh he's like a...,,,,,Phoebe,
 ...like a...,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, good! Ok...",,,,,Phoebe,
" (raises hand) Oh! I know! (Rachel startled) It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...",,,,,Phoebe,
 The end.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Should I not have told you?,,,,,Phoebe,
" I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, ok bye-bye.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, just look at her... (girls move toward Rachel on the balcony)",,,,,Phoebe,
 You ok?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yep!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oops!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Isn't he great?,,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, this is my friend Roger.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (Intercom) It's Phoebe.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Isn't he good?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey. ,,,,,Phoebe,
 Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.,,,,,Phoebe,
 So what's going on?,,,,,Phoebe,
"Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Nothing, nothing.",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.",,,,,Phoebe,
 But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...,,,,,Phoebe,
 Intense and creepy. ,,,,,Phoebe,
" But I don't. Me, Phoebe.",,,,,Phoebe,
" You're not? See, that's why you're so great! ",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, right.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, Joey. What's going on?",,,,,Phoebe,
" 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, that's ok! [throws it in fire] Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, yeah, ok. [she throws the directions in] Oh, OK.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.",,,,,Phoebe,
" See, there you go, the cleansing works!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh! Oh! Fun! Ok. Um, Liam Neeson.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Morly Safer.,,,,,Phoebe,
 The woman who cuts my hair!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, really.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Riff's. Yeah, I know.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hmmm? Uh, yeah. So, uh, is she fat?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Where were you standing?,,,,,Phoebe,
" It's mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know. Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it, later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like ""yeah, right, well what else is new""?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why? Why would you wanna do that? Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I mean, I'm not my sister's, you know, whatever, and uh, I mean, it's true, we were one egg, once, but you know, we've grown apart. So, uh, I don't know. Why not?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah I'm fine.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Right, and it's me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Much as you are.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, that's good.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Good choice.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, my first birthday present. Oh, this is really--",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, sure, yeah. Ok, it fits.",,,,,Phoebe,
 That you like. We get it. You like her. Great.,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, well, maybe now it's not ok.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ok.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Where're you going?,,,,,Phoebe,
 With?,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, could I just ask you one question? Have you two, you know...like, you know, you know, yet?",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, so, can we turn this off? Just, just make it--make them go away? I can't, I can't look.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. Yeah. It's just, you know, it's this whole stupid Ursula thing.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I'm not saying she's like evil or anything. She just, you know, she's always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. Oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like, have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, but that's what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then broke his heart, and then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore. Because he said he didn't wanna be around anything that looked like either one of us. I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but--",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 But he's falling in love with her.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok. Oh, ok, oh.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, what's going on?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room. Where's Joey?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi. Trouble?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, no. Don't you just hate it when people aren't there for you?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, you, got a minute?",,,,,Phoebe,
 So.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Right, like the kind you--",,,,,Phoebe,
 How'd you know I was coming?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I can't believe you did this. I can't believe you--did this.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Does he know?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You got me.,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, um, are you gonna call him?",,,,,Phoebe,
 No. Joey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 No. No food with a face.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, you too.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Listen, um.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm sorry.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, um, you know, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, yeah, so it's not gonna work.",,,,,Phoebe,
" If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, then yes, 'cause of Phoebe. So, you know, it's either her or me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" You know, you're gonna be really, really hard to get over.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Is he all right?,,,,,Phoebe,
" [reading]: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh... [crumples up letter]",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow!,,,,,Phoebe,
 [reading]: Your Visa bill is huge!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Congratulations!,,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.",,,,,Phoebe,
" But... I'm ready, so, just deal.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [to Joey]: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.",,,,,Phoebe,
 About how good your cards were.,,,,,Phoebe,
 A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?,,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ha. Ha, ha.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank y-- [thinks about it],,,,,Phoebe,
" Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, here's my $7.50. [hands them the money] But I think you should know that this money is cursed.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [holding a card and waving it in front of her face] Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. [they look at her] Right, OK, serious poker.",,,,,Phoebe,
 [looks at her cards] Yes! [everyone looks at her] .... or no.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. Um... I'm out. [throws in cards],,,,,Phoebe,
" Monica, in or out?",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK Joey, your bet.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ross?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Chandler?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Me too. Rachel.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm in.,,,,,Phoebe,
 ...teen! [throws in a ten-dollar bill],,,,,Phoebe,
 That's a bird?,,,,,Phoebe,
 That's a bird!,,,,,Phoebe,
 So good!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...",,,,,Phoebe,
 [Entering] Hey. ,,,,,Phoebe,
" Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, how?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Which one?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles. [They move off]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, but there isn't always time!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Marcel?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Marcel?,,,,,Phoebe,
 OhmyGod!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Something just brushed up against my right leg!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, think so. Oh! [She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in the butt and removes it] Huh. [Sways back] Whoah.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Nope.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! [She stands up and starts to dance around] Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" How can people do that?... (ALL BUT PHOEBE WALK AWAY FROM THE WINDOW IN DISGUST) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, God, just do it! (GETTING PHONE) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!",,,,,Phoebe,
" So, uh, why didn't you say anything?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, they're just talking...",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (ENTER RACHEL) Oh!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Not a good day for birds...,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! (WALKS TO WINDOW) Go away! (GESTICULATING) Stop looking in here!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You cook naked?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.",,,,,Phoebe,
 How many beeps?,,,,,Phoebe,
 How'd he take it?,,,,,Phoebe,
 s*x in his chair.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Where are you going?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Radiator.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Rdtor.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You know he's gay?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Whoo-hoo!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! [Points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa]",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What are you doing?,,,,,Phoebe,
" This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, MONICA, DON'T DO IT!! ...Thank you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Lotsa things.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I think she means [Imitates] 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. [They put on some spare shoes]",,,,,Phoebe,
" [Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way] I'm totally getting it!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey. We found her, we found the girl.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.,,,,,Phoebe,
 ...Flame Boy.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Goodbye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the 'plane.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Tell him, tell him.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Doing it on this table. [points at the table],,,,,Phoebe,
" [points at Joeyīs pen] Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this ""massage-yourself-at-home-workshop"". And they are.",,,,,Phoebe,
" What... I could, I could do it. What is it?",,,,,Phoebe,
 I could be a secretary.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I could do that.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, maybe 25-26.",,,,,Phoebe,
 There you go.,,,,,Phoebe,
 [plays with a thumbtack remover] Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh. Uh, Iīm on. [picks up the phone]",,,,,Phoebe,
" [with a deep voice] Mr. Bingīs office. No Iīm sorry, heīs in a meeting right now.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, Iīll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ross says hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
" This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Most likely. [raises and goes toward the door] Okay, Iīm gonna be out there.",,,,,Phoebe,
 All right. Bye bye.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Whatcha doinī?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I didnīt tell anybody that I knew you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, because, you know... they donīt like you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I thought you knew that.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Donīt feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now youīre like ""Mr. Boss Man"". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, ""Boss Man Bing"".",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, yeah. They even do you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?',,,,,Phoebe,
" That is so sweet, you guys. [hugs them]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, oh, Iīve gotta go. [raises] Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. [sits down, and then raises again] Cool!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, oh, Iīve got a birthday party, with some work people.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I know. Thatīs a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravagance.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I really do, yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I donīt wanna be the geek that invited the boss.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You were great. But they still made fun of you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You know, now youīre more like, you know like, ""Mr. Caring Boss"", ""Mr."", you know, ""Iīm one of you, Boss"", ""Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing""",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, you know what Chandler? I think youīve gotta face it. Youīre like, the guy in the big office, you know. Youīre the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say youīre a great boss.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh huh. But theyīre not your friends anymore.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, but you canīt.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh uh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Petrie.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like ""forget about her"" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, ""Oh my god."" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes.,,,,,Phoebe,
" 'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had s*x, you're wondering if they've changed it?",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, so what were you thinking?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh. No.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly a**l and an unbelievable control freak.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm still on ""no"".",,,,,Phoebe,
 What's goin' on?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ewww!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Where?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, hey Ross.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right. Ok, but, but you have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, that's it, I quit.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Demi Moore.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, oh, oh my god!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, you come on in.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank you.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You wanna do it right now?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andy McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my god, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?",,,,,Phoebe,
" I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Woof, woof.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, all right. What did I have?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ben, dinner!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I licked my arm, what?",,,,,Phoebe,
 So?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You won't even taste it?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Come on. It doesn't taste bad.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait, wait, wait, wait!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I miss Janice though. ""Hello, Chandler Bing.""",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Nah. Not really.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I just don't buy it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, don't get me started on gravity.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Really? You can actually see it?,,,,,Phoebe,
" See, I didn't know that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.",,,,,Phoebe,
" What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.",,,,,Phoebe,
 He's even kind of cute.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I'd call that excessive.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Janice? You called Janice?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?",,,,,Phoebe,
 I can't believe you caved.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh huh. Why is that?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You're there!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I might have.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having s*x with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You have a third nipple?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, is there a hair on it?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ta-da.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Do I? Thank you, so do you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.",,,,,Phoebe,
 OK.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, right, OK. Ole.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, the matador. [Duncan leaves] Ole, ha ha ha.",,,,,Phoebe,
" So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohh. . .K. How come?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Huuh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.",,,,,Phoebe,
 So how long have you known?,,,,,Phoebe,
" And um, and there's actually a, a woman?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, um, have you told your parents?",,,,,Phoebe,
" [handing him the papers] Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.",,,,,Phoebe,
 So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?",,,,,Phoebe,
 It's Ross.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Let's see!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, look at these prices.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...",,,,,Phoebe,
 Not for you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Fine. All right, fine.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, then...Let's.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it's like a skit.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Cool.,,,,,Phoebe,
 So...Thank you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Actually, it makes us feel that big.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Fine.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ok. One.,,,,,Phoebe,
" We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, ""hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck"".",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing) I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing) Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.",,,,,Phoebe,
" But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.",,,,,Phoebe,
" And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could. ",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. (Out on the sidewalk, singing) When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. (Someone puts a coin in her guitar case) Thank you! La la la la la la la....",,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing) ... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Right. My name was on there, but now it just says ""carrot cake"". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, so you know D?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, do you know A minor?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh. Mine does. (singing) Stephanie knows all the chords. (makes a face),,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing angrily) Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (singing/screaming) You're all invited to bite me!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, hi.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang ""Su-Su-Suicide"", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, ""Smelly Cat"", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really? From who?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. Here you go.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's ""smelly cat, smel-ly cat"".",,,,,Phoebe,
 Better. Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You wanna try it again?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Mmmm hmmm.,,,,,Phoebe,
 That's too much. Sorry.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Happy Christmas Eve Eve. [sees Ross's picture frame] Oh my God, where did you get this?",,,,,Phoebe,
" This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Just, you know, to see... um.",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, is this really my father?",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh God.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?",,,,,Phoebe,
 [realizes] Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information. [hangs up]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Whattaya mean?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow. Thank you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! [blows a kiss to a picture of Einstein]",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, let's go.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, here, you have to hold this. [hands Chandler a piece of paper]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. [Chandler jumps out of the car]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, this is it, 74. [screeches to a halt, Joey and Chandler are thrown into the plexiglass wall in the cab]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'. [she just sits in the cab]",,,,,Phoebe,
 OK.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Mailbox.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I couldn't go in.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?",,,,,Phoebe,
 You guuuyys.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ""ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage."" Little did she know God was thinking, ""Ok, but that's it."" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I think it went into me.,,,,,Phoebe,
 [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Sit up!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?,,,,,Phoebe,
" [Mrs. Adelman's voice] In my day, divorce was not an option.",,,,,Phoebe,
 That's him.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, do you wanna sit?",,,,,Phoebe,
" I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Everything?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [enters] Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. [Takes Mrs. Green's chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh, such a pretty face.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Sir! No sir!,,,,,Phoebe,
" [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! [Phoebe's voice] Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I miss Rose.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, that's so nice.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, me, too, technically.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.",,,,,Phoebe,

" No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK. [they kiss] OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. [singing]",,,,,Phoebe,

 Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yay, I rock.",,,,,Phoebe,

 Thinkin' about it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, hi again.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Fired! Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I see.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Who's Barney.,,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, Rachel, I'm ready.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, yeah I guess that's me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [singing] Sometimes men love women,",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Stick a fork what?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you just know.",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.",,,,,Phoebe,
" There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on.",,,,,Phoebe,
 [sees Marcel at the window] Oh my God.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?",,,,,Phoebe,
 About 20 minutes.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, some guy she met at the movies.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hang in there, it's gonna happen.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Because she's your lobster.,,,,,Phoebe,
" C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .",,,,,Phoebe,
" So, do you have any other possibilities?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What is that sparkly thing?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Do you want a refill?,,,,,Phoebe,
" OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. [she sticks out her gut, clears her throat and sniffs her nose and then in her best male voice. . .] Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my pen1s now.",,,,,Phoebe,
 It's not that bad.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Chandler, Chandler.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I think she's OK.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Do the claws again.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey now you have two. [Chandler looks annoyed] Oh, now you have two.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [Standing in living room with Chandler and Joey. She pulls a huge bathing suit out of a box] Hey, Mon, what is this?",,,,,Phoebe,
" See, he's her lobster.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey cool, mine too.",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.",,,,,Phoebe,
 It's James Bond.,,,,,Phoebe,
" [entering the kitchen from the party] That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You are so smitten.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.",,,,,Phoebe,
 So. You two are totally into each other.,,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?",,,,,Phoebe,
 We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You're not the only one who has a date tonight.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh you are so lucky.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ahh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okey-doke.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I think on my shoulder. [Ross enters],,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I think you should tell them.",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?",,,,,Phoebe,
" I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Here we go.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You're not going?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?,,,,,Phoebe,
" I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, who is the boss of you?!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh OK. [pulls over her shirt and shows a bare shoulder] Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, well then what is this? [shows her bare shoulder]",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, that's my tattoo.",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" [looking at a water sculpture that looks like a window with rain running down it] Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing. ",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.",,,,,Phoebe,
 So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm done now.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK. [singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat [back up singers start singing smelly, smelly, smelly, smelly behind her] Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?",,,,,Phoebe,
" OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.",,,,,Phoebe,
" OK. [singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat [back up singers - smelly, smelly, smelly, really bad smelly cat, it's not your fault] OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. [puts the tape in] OK.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I can't work with people who would do this.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I mean this poor woman.,,,,,Phoebe,
" The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Monica.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Chandler.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Rachel.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why don't you play with your roommate?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, it'll be fun. [throws a tennis ball at Eddie's bedroom door]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him. [leaves]",,,,,Phoebe,
" And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ok.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why would you kill his fish?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.",,,,,Phoebe,
" But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Didn't it like totally speak to you?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, 'cause he's yummy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Um-um, um-um.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Paul.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Is anyone else starting to really like him?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey. Watcha guys doin?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.",,,,,Phoebe,
" C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.,,,,,Phoebe,
" He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.",,,,,Phoebe,
" What, what's about to happen? [starts watching] I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END. [hear the gunshot from the TV]",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.",,,,,Phoebe,
" With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Me too. [leaves],,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, ""It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does.""",,,,,Phoebe,
" [pauses the tape] Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go. [starts the tape again]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I'm so glad you're here.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.",,,,,Phoebe,
 And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.,,,,,Phoebe,
 No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Thanks. [gets out of the cab],,,,,Phoebe,
" [a little dog starts attacking her leg] Hey, hey, no, oh oh.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. [Flings the dog off and jumps in the cab. The dog keeps jumping up to the window.] Ok, alright, we have a problem.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you crazy?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I don't know.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, thanks. Sorry, again",,,,,Phoebe,
 [innocently] What was that?,,,,,Phoebe,
 [enters] Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. [goes over and grabs the phone that's sitting by Monica]",,,,,Phoebe,
 So talk to her.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
" It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ok so will he be back soon?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Stilts?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't know what to do with that.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'",,,,,Phoebe,
 That'll work too.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, that'd be ok.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, I'm in the book.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright. So um, stilts huh?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ok.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey nice boobs.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why not her?,,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry, I didn't know.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?",,,,,Phoebe,
" And because you're both, you know, white women.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [cutting Mrs. Greene off] Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon. [they go in the bathroom]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Listen if you wanna go, just go.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, I can get you out.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Great, I'm seeing water rings again.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.",,,,,Phoebe,
 There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Everything you've heard is true.,,,,,Phoebe,
" [enters with the three people she got out] Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. [opens the door, the guys are right there] Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [enters] Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. [Sees a red bump on her arm.] Oh look!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah? Are you sure, really. [She picks up a mirror and sees the white splotches all over her face.]",,,,,Phoebe,
" I, I, I'm hideous.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Come in.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey Ryan, what's up?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.,,,,,Phoebe,
" 'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, ohh.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.,,,,,Phoebe,
" And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... [she unveils herself right as a huge lightning bolt crashes outside. Ryan screams in terror.] Oh, I am scary.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.",,,,,Phoebe,
 That you don't stop talking about it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. [She picks up the dice.] Here we go, double sixes, here we go... [She starts to rub the dice all over herself.] Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...",,,,,Phoebe,
" No. This is what I do for luck, ok.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No. Here. [Throws them on the table.] There. Ooh, double sixes.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body. [Grabs a handful of the houses.]",,,,,Phoebe,
 Give it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good. [She starts scratching him.]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.,,,,,Phoebe,
 It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Please. [Ryan pulls the cork with his teeth and spits it into Phoebe's mits.],,,,,Phoebe,
 I got it. [Wipes it up with her mits.],,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You know what, that's it, that's it. [She rips off the mits, Ryan follows her lead.]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, I'll walk you out.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that. [They kiss.]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Bye you. [Ryan's cab drives off. As Phoebe is going back in, she sees the Central Perk sign in the window and laughs.]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing (Chandler and Monica, give her a look that says 'think about it') Ooh.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-huh, let's go. (they move in to kiss) Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. (they kiss rather passionately) Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (laughing) Oh my God, you look so good!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on, like you never talk that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Bye, good luck.",,,,,Phoebe,
" So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that (points at the computer screen).",,,,,Phoebe,
 What does she mean by HH?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you the cutest?,,,,,Phoebe,
" You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.",,,,,Phoebe,
 It could be like a big giant guy.,,,,,Phoebe,
 We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'",,,,,Phoebe,
 Well at least we know she's a woman.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, my.",,,,,Phoebe,
 She wants to meet you in person.,,,,,Phoebe,
" What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! (Chandler runs and picks up his shoes) Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. (Chandler runs to the bathroom, as the computer bing-bongs) No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. (Chandler runs to the computer) No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much. (Chandler walks slowly into the kitchen)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...",,,,,Phoebe,
" See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing) Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi Monica!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, has she slept at all?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal. (Ross gives her this look, like 'Yeah, doesn't it', and gets up to dump it down the drain.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Maybe, because you told him not to.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!",,,,,Phoebe,
 No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair look like the Princess Leia 'do.) Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. (Ross stands up horrified) There he is.",,,,,Phoebe,
" ( in a soothing voice) Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....",,,,,Phoebe,
" Monica, do you want us to take you home?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hello.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Thank you! I know, though.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.",,,,,Phoebe,
 All right all ready.,,,,,Phoebe,
" We could not, would not want to wait.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I don't know, you might be the first one.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (on machine) ""Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?"" (to the guys) Is that too spooky?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What am I gonna do?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hummus. I got the hummus.,,,,,Phoebe,
 That won't go with this dress though.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Monica, you don't know that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me! (she's wearing another dress on a hanger around her neck)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering from Rachel's room, wearing a huge bow to cover the stain) Okay, I'm ready.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'",,,,,Phoebe,
 Duh!! Christmas!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Definitely.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I'll get it, okay. (answers phone) Hi, Monica and Rachel's. (listens) Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. (to Monica) Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, we're on it. We're on it.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (yelling from the bedroom) Get away from that! No! (she comes into the living room carrying the phone) She's just getting dressed.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!",,,,,Phoebe,
 How did you do that?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (turns around) Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you're not a dingus.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait, (grabs him) you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. (they start to leave, he is still following her) Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah. What's this? (picks up a book)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, not even a little bit.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay then.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Good. So what were you thinking?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay. (he kisses her)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hellooo!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.",,,,,Phoebe,
" What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What are you saying I should do?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Thank you, Monica.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes? Yes! Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh. (picks one up out of the garbage can.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know (in a high pitched voice) Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, oh! It's on again!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay,",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean,",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.",,,,,Phoebe,
 That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my,,,,,Phoebe,
" What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different",,,,,Phoebe,
 (on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey,,,,,Phoebe,
" (on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition,",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone",,,,,Phoebe,
" (on phone, in 'Katelynn's' voice) 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay",,,,,Phoebe,
" (in voice, on phone) 'Okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on",,,,,Phoebe,
" It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Two?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Helloo! Oh! (sees Joey and starts to leave),,,,,Phoebe,
" No it's not, sorry.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't",,,,,Phoebe,
" But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry",,,,,Phoebe,
" Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So,",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, no, I understand.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. Sorry. (she starts to leave),,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,

 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, but he’s always late.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, ‘Frank’s always late.’",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I know, I’m just nervous. Y'know it’s just y'know Mom’s dead, don’t talk to my sister, Grandma’s been sleeping a lot lately. It’s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You’re so sweet to wait with me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.,,,,,Phoebe,
 This is everybody. This is Ross.,,,,,Phoebe,

 This is Monica.,,,,,Phoebe,
 And this is Rachel.,,,,,Phoebe,

" (sits up) Oh, ew!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn’t, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. (tries to do it, but can’t)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can’t. We don’t have that....",,,,,Phoebe,
 Feburary 16th.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, that’s close. When’s yours?",,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.",,,,,Phoebe,
 So is it like art?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I’m just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.",,,,,Phoebe,
" G’night, bro.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Here. (gives him a fire extinguisher) Y'know, just in case.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No kind. He just makes it up.,,,,,Phoebe,
" So far, it kinda blows. I don’t know, I just thought y'know that he’d feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ah!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, how do you play the shadow game?",,,,,Phoebe,

" Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. (phone rings and Phoebe answers it) ‘Hello. (listens) Oh my God, I totally forgot! (listens) Well can’t someone else do it. (listens) But, I have company. (listens) Yeah, no look, that’s all right I’ll come in.’ (hangs up phone) Um, Frank, I’m really sorry but I have to go to work. It’s-it’s one of my regulars and he’s insisting that I do ‘um.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! I’m a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, y'know we don’t call it that, but yeah!",,,,,Phoebe,
 All righty. I’ll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, you can get one yourself. It’ll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, no, I wouldn’t do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I’ll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!-Hey! What’s going on?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You can’t have s*x with her!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (turns around and hits Frank) So that’s what you thought I did!! God! That’s not what I do!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Nooo! Why would you think that?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Whatever, it’s the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You really thought it was perfect?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t....,,,,,Phoebe,
" Right, okay, um-mm.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I guess I do, yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I-I wasn’t hopping mad, y'know.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 She wasn’t a hooker.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Maybe all the rulers are wrong.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, it’s like a dirty math problem.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, that is so unfortunate.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (angrily) Bye-bye! (to Ross) That’s why I moved out.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I think on some levels she already knows.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, well maybe not on those levels.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Why, nobody good?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, really?",,,,,Phoebe,
 So what are they doing?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Monica, who’s entering) Hey, you’re early.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m just taking it to be re-wired.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You don’t play the oboe!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Then I’m gonna have to ask you to keep it down. (slams the door in his face.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Huh?,,,,,Phoebe,
 It’s not in the apartment? (Monica gives a ‘Come on’ look) Oh no. I can’t believe this is happening again.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I’ve, I don’t live here anymore.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m sorry, I-I-I-I don’t live here anymore. I-I didn’t know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!",,,,,Phoebe,
" That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that happening.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Aww, good. (they hug) What?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it’s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh no! Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m sorry.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Aw, God Ross. Oh.(goes over and hugs him)",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross. You’re, you’re really, you’re so good. (kisses him on the cheek)",,,,,Phoebe,
 And you’re so sweet. (kisses him on the other cheek) And you’re kind (kisses him on the lips),,,,,Phoebe,
 Huh?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, it’s okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh. (they start kissing again),,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,

" Well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You have chalk on your face.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this was real grass.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Who’s singing?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ewww! Oh! It’s the Mattress King!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I can’t say croissant. (realises) Oh my God!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ugh! I don’t know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying Chandler.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and she makes the ‘that went right over your head’ motion) Woo!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler’s your friend... (hops onto the bed) Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?,,,,,Phoebe,

" Oh, yay!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this huge black delievery guy.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It’s that bedroom there. (points to Monica’s room)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, so please, please, please, don’t say anything to Chandler.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Is that a problem?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let’s see what you got. All right ya, put ‘em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren’t acting Christian enough.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! Oh! Oh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow! And I’m a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I’m sorry, we’ll put some ice on it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" ‘Kay, put your head back.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, I have ya. Oh God.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it’s the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m, I’m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn’t have! All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?",,,,,Phoebe,
 I am soo dead. (goes to Monica’s room),,,,,Phoebe,
 Isn’t it cool! Varoom! Varoom!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, you must’ve won like a contest or something!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m sorry, okay, I-I wasn’t looking, and the store says that they won’t take it back because you signed for it...",,,,,Phoebe,
" When I was you! Y'know what, it’s all Joey’s fault, ‘cause he left his nose open!",,,,,Phoebe,
 It’s Monica’s bed. What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" So. This has always been Monica’s bed, what you’re just noticing now, how self-involved are you?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, if you really, really want it, then it’s okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, it’s just my tooth.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, fine, fine, but if you’re my next victim, don’t come",,,,,Phoebe,
" Although, don’t feel like you can’t visit.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe I’ll kill",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I’m going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the",,,,,Phoebe,
 (running through the door) No! Oh! You’re alive! You’re,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, well, we’ll see about that. Can I use your phone? I",,,,,Phoebe,
" (on phone) ‘Hey! You’re not dead! Okay, see ya!’",,,,,Phoebe,
 (rushing in) Okay. If you’re alive you answer your phone!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this,,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here,,,,,Phoebe,
 He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (joining him) ‘Love....’,,,,,Phoebe,
 ‘I know.’,,,,,Phoebe,
 ‘I’ve found....’,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. (just as she sits down).",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yay!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, so how do we decide that?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,

 Go! Go! Go!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh I got it!! (catches the ball) Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Touchdown!! Touchdown!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Woo-yay!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I love this game!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn’t the play still going.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Isn’t there a national football league.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Have fun. Oh wait, no, don’t! I forgot I am totally against that now.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey, how do you sleep at night?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (walking up to Joey) Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh...",,,,,Phoebe,
 Destiny.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. (One of Joey’s co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes! That one doesn’t look very fulfilled.",,,,,Phoebe,
" You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.",,,,,Phoebe,
" So, what happens to the old guys?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Why, do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds? (Joey points out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play in the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against Joey’s shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (running up carrying a tree) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don’t want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead tree she has)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay but that’s why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it’s Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this one’s yours! Ahhh.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to get so emotional, I guess it’s just the holidays, it’s hard.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I wasn’t even thinking about that.",,,,,Phoebe,
 This is the worst Christmas ever.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
" You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you’re the best!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, God bless us, everyone.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Why don’t you go up there and ask him to ‘step lightly, please?’",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I’ll go up there, I’ll tell him to keep it down.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (muffled through the floor) Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... (I tired but the rest is unintelligible).",,,,,Phoebe,
" (muffled) Oh, thank you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, he’s very charming.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, you’re just gonna have to try.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (to one of his sisters, Cookie) Hey!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow. Okay, I don’t know how to talk to you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Why, what happened?",,,,,Phoebe,
 How can you not know which one?,,,,,Phoebe,
 We didn’t fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh well y'know. (laughs),,,,,Phoebe,
" Ick, you were eavesdropping.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I’m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Thanks you guys! Thank you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" God, I hope they kick his ass!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich�. Why don't you get a magician?!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, can you dance at all?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (covering her mouth in shock) What, what is that?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!",,,,,Phoebe,
" What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, (reading) 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What are you wrapping?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, it's a vase.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Well not exactly like the one in the poem.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. (hugs her),,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering, holding a pair of Roller Blades) Hi.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that’s he’s going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m going to let him.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, there’s no such thing as an innocent burger.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Robert) You’ve have lipstick right here (points to her cheek). That’s okay, it’s mine, we just kissed.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’ll have coffee.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I get more because I’m dainty.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?",,,,,Phoebe,
" What? (the guys keep laughing.) What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? (the guys keep laughing.) Why are you laughing?!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You guys!! Come on!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What do you mean?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey. Ooh! Don’t sit down!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. And, first here’s a gift.",,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s all right, that’s well, I figured.... (they start to leave as Joey enters.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Listen, Robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I can spot you from here.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, listen Robert...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, I think you’re really, really great...",,,,,Phoebe,
" I-I-I-I-I don’t know, I don’t know what to say.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (to Chandler) Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she’s done.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, one of those ‘look for the hidden meaning’ songs.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey Leslie, how’d you know I’d be here?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hmm, bummer.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No. But thanks.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. No. But thanks.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. (to Monica) Can I have a tissue, please?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Where’s Chandler?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh. (takes her beeper puts in a pot, covers it, and puts the pot in the oven)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That’s the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You never run on a barge!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!,,,,,Phoebe,
" It’s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t called. Not that I even care, y'know.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You think you know me so well.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s what I said.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I can’t. I can’t. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was ‘Okay, bye Pheebs’ gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like all my lives.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (singing) I stepped in something icky.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it’s not your fault.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.",,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s okay. All right, I’m gonna play song that’s really, really sad. It’s called Magician Box Mix Up. (she turns her guitar upside down to play it.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Leslie) Oh, I thought you weren’t coming. What? Where were you?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, don’t give me a reason to get mad, okay",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, look, I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would’ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can’t trust you then just forget it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won’t be partners. So what’s it gonna be?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life’s gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. (singing) ‘Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.’ That’s all I have so far.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don’t know where his country is.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh!! That’s my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There’s a ‘g’ in there.,,,,,Phoebe,
 In your atlas!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, well he’s very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn’t speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What is this?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that’s dumb what I said, don’t tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. (Mischa does so and Sergei kisses her hand.) Nice, (to Mischa) thank you. This is me. Here.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Mischa) Thank you, very much! Oh! (to Sergei) Thank you!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Mischa) Okay, y'know what, you don’t have to do that now. (Mischa translates that to Sergei) No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don’t! (Mischa tells Sergei he can proceed and steps away) Well the moment’s over.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (pointing to the globe) See there it is right there.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. Except for, y'know when you’re on a date and you’re getting along really great but the guy’s translator keeps getting in the way.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Monica) Anyway, I’m going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator’s date? So that when we, it’s time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he’s really, he’s kinda cute.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, don’t call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (laughing and banging her spoon on the table) Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You didn’t say Boutros Boutros Gali.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Interesting.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. (Behind the menu) What are you doing?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other.",,,,,Phoebe,
 That would be great. Thank you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don’t accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, tell him, apology accepted.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Excuse me, but umm, isn’t he paying for your dinner?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Plate! Yes, plate.",,,,,Phoebe,
" See, we don’t need them.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ameri-can.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ameri-can. Y'know it’s a very hard language. Let’s do it again.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.",,,,,Phoebe,
" The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Now what is Fabutec?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Waxine!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.",,,,,Phoebe,
 God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?,,,,,Phoebe,
 They have the best stuff in there.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,",,,,,Phoebe,
 Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Was it not pain-free?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ow!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 We’re all right.,,,,,Phoebe,
 We’re all right.,,,,,Phoebe,
" For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey’s arm and puts a strip on it.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Joey) What, what are they talking about?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Whe-where did he put it?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Should we do something?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hi, it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, ‘cause it’s like 9:15 now, and I’m not there.",,,,,Phoebe,
 We could eat the wax! It’s organic.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, not the used wax.",,,,,Phoebe,
" They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.",,,,,Phoebe,
 They’ve been quiet for a long time.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh come on, they can be in the same room.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why? What happened now?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (turning around and picking a cup off of a table) Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! (handing her the cup) Okay, let’s skedaddle.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, your highness.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (in a deep voice, imitating Ross) Um, Rachel I’m really sorry. (imitating Rachel) That’s okay, do you wanna get back together? (imitating Ross) Yeah, okay. (in her normal voice) Did anyone else hear that?!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, it’s just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Chandler what are you doing?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Him? Him, Ross?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wait. Really?! ‘Cause mine get me out of tickets.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel’s sister’s cabin. (Chandler goes back to the window to smoke again.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y'know what, I can stay, I’m gonna stay. ‘Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Chandler!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What does the sign say?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, the ‘No Smoking’ sign. There’s no smoking in my Grandmother’s cab.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Please!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Rachel, who’s staying in the cab.) Aren’t you gonna go?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, y'know what don’t close it (Rachel slams the door shut locking themselves out.) ‘cause the... keys...are in there.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, Monica’s are the biggest.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (finishing removing her bra) Okay, there.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. (The car moves a few feet and sputters to a stop.) Oh, no!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, this has happened before.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yep. Put more gas in.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, yeah. (to Monica and Rachel) Triple A can pick us up.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, what town are we near?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (to Monica) Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we’re on?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. (on phone) We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. (to Rachel) There is no Route 27. (listens) (to Rachel) Okay, either 93 or 76?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. (on phone) Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? (listens) Okay! (hangs up) Yeah, no they don’t do that.",,,,,Phoebe,
 But if...,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (answering the phone) (whispering) Ross, thank God.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I ate a bug.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so we can’t get a tow truck.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, please.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it’s Ross on one of his drives!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Chandler and Monica) You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we’re then gonna go skiing?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! (they all stop fighting, Chandler continues to dance.) Look what you’re doing to Chandler!! (Chandler finally stops) (to Ross and Rachel) Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? (Ross starts to leave) You don’t, all right you don’t have to love each other, okay? You don’t, you don’t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, otherwise, I mean that’s, that’s, that’s just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? (they both look away) Can you be civil?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Or, or the rodeo!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Bye!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Frank! Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What are you doing here?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What happened?,,,,,Phoebe,
" But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Your getting married?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 My little brother’s getting married!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Do I?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I do, yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, isn’t it fantastic?",,,,,Phoebe,
" What, he’s 18.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I’m a big surprise.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you’re ready for that?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh good! Okay. ‘Cause you were acting like you didn’t.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I know, I know, that this is Frank’s life, (walks behind them, they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I don’t want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it’s sick and wrong!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat!",,,,,Phoebe,
" But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes. Not out loud.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can’t. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank. (exits)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (to Joey) You’re Frank’s best man?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well then, (to Ross) what about you?! Huh?!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I’m so glad you could come, ‘cause I’ve got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. (Points to the table cloth, which has a huge mustard stain on it.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y'know what, forget it. It’s ruined.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?",,,,,Phoebe,
" What umm, what happened?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y'know what, maybe it’s just all for the best?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know. And you’re gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, but.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better than I can.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but not just that.",,,,,Phoebe,
 None the less.,,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s right, exactly. (sees them) All right, it’s a good bye kiss, that’s good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I’m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore her) Okay, I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves).",,,,,Phoebe,
 We were out of Doritos.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.,,,,,Phoebe,
" What, so what are you gonna tell him?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then.",,,,,Phoebe,
" So, you’re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, kinda.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isn’t it Spiderman? Y’know like Goldman, Silverman...",,,,,Phoebe,
 It isn’t?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay well, he would turn things to gold.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ahh, his work is done.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kick up the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait, am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad, in a way.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, just a barrel.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?! Really?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It’s so beautiful.,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, I’m here, ready to play.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (She removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the house.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s a dog, every house should have a dog.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.) Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, we’re not welcome in the house of no imagination.",,,,,Phoebe,
 The little ones do.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing the interior.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay, it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides a doll down the slide)",,,,,Phoebe,
" The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some incense)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the house.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" And, and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What happened?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 All right. Did everyone get out okay?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves to remove it.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, they took my idea!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! Okay, here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, are you guys okay?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, oh, about three months.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this",,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Pete) Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a",,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?",,,,,Phoebe,
 ‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial",,,,,Phoebe,
" Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! ,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, I have to tell you something.",,,,,Phoebe,
 But I can’t tell you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t",,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, but let’s come back to that later!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Noo!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?",,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (Shaking her head yes) No!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t know! (frantically points at Monica),,,,,Phoebe,
 I can’t!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I, but you’re so close! No!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, just go. You’re never gonna get it!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he’s at Flimby’s.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah, that’s the word I use when I can’t remember the real thing.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No! Rachel, that’s what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don’t get through, they’re not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It’s us versus them!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Like a date type (looks at Rachel) person?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thanks!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. (on phone) Ooh, I’m setting the phone down. (does so) But I’m still here! Just don’t go anywhere I’m still here. (starts to put on the sweater) Don’t-don’t switch or anything, ‘cause I’m, I’m right here. (She has pulled the sweater over her head, but her head is stuck in a sleeve.) Just one sec. One sec! One second!! (She is now frantically trying to get the sweater on, as Monica returns from the bathroom.) Wait! One second! Just…",,,,,Phoebe,
" What?! Monica, I’m scared!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes!! Yes!! I’m the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.,,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, is the play over?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Nah. I kept myself busy.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay, yeah. (to Monica) I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, I’m fine, and y’know why? ‘Cause of all the riboflavin.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you’re play. I swear you’re play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You’re play is the next play is the next play I’m gonna see.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I… (starts jabbering incoherently)",,,,,Phoebe,
" I do, I believe you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. But I also believed her (points to the phone) when she said I was next.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it’s one of those 801 numbers. Right?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it’s has to be 800. (picks up the instruction manual to check the phone number) ‘Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. (Finds the number) Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Sorry, I’m so sorry, I will pay you back.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Fine! Fine! (slams the phone down, breaking it) Oh-oh!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I think I broke it. But that’s all right, here’s the number you can call.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (to her date) Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music. (points to the stage)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Vince is a fireman.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. (watches him leave),,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Does a dog's lips move when he reads? (Joey makes an `I don't know' face, and looks to Chandler and Rachel, who're also stumped) Okay, no they don't.",,,,,Phoebe,
" That is so great! Oh, I... (sees that a parked car near them has caught on fire) Oh my God!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (the fire has worsened) Oh my God!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (stopping him) No! No!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. (hears the sound of approaching sirens) Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? (she drags him away)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering with Rachel) …and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (disgusted) Uh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly. (giggles)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Jason is not a sissy!,,,,,Phoebe,
" God, that is the nicest kitchen.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.",,,,,Phoebe,
 All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it’s just Jason’s so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it’s just better than having just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (Her eyes glaze over thinking about the butt.) (pause) Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! I didn’t know you guys actually used those.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, wow. This-this isn’t gonna be easy. Umm, I don’t think we should see each other anymore.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m sorry.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, I didn’t…",,,,,Phoebe,
 (running after him) Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Ross) I’m telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (gasps) Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. (They both look at her.) Like for clubbing.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and… Okay so Jason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now so’s Vince (holds up one finger on her other hand) Plus, Vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the Vince side) So… It’s really just about the math.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (knocks on the door) Jason?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Nah-ha!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing) “Crazy underwear, creepin’ up my butt. (Jason enters) Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under-(sees Jason)-wear…” (In her head) Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You’ll get through this; you’ll be fine. (She tries to continue the song, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out as gibberish.) (giving up on the song) Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I don’t know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, okay, I’ve-I’ve been dating both of you, and it’s been really horrible. ‘Cause y'know it’s been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn’t know how to chose, so... I’m sorry, I’m just, I’m terrible, I’m a terrible person. I’m terrible.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, this is none of my business. (starts to walk away)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Vince) Well, that could’ve been really awkward.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I’m gonna do that for you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, so, so you went to Pete’s...",,,,,Phoebe,
" So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No-no-no oh, keep your name, don’t take his name.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Well then definately don’t take his name.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (intrigued) Oh?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (disappointed) Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeesh, what’d you do about it?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it...",,,,,Phoebe,
" You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Great! Okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way),,,,,Phoebe,
 (to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, Bonnie’s the best!",,,,,Phoebe,
" So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, that’s too bad!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?",,,,,Phoebe,
 No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (looking in the window) Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You said it was okay!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?,,,,,Phoebe,
 So?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, we killed them all.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering, hurridly) Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look",,,,,Phoebe,
 Y'know what that means?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No-no, that’s not, that’s not me Phoebe, that’s her pal",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of,,,,,Phoebe,
 So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I wasn’t talking about his karma.",,,,,Phoebe,
" And this time, they’ve ganged up to form one giant, super hat.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oy!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (at the door) Knock, knock, knock.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering) Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hi Phoebe Abott, I’m your best friends daughter!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. (hands her the",,,,,Phoebe,
" (points to herself) Phoebe. (points to her) Phoebe. Phoebe,",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That’s my Dad, that’s Frank! Yeah! I’m",,,,,Phoebe,
" No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks. ",,,,,Phoebe,

" (disappointed) Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, what? What was it?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (happily) Yeah, no, it was great.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering) Oh, hey!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, so, how are we doing?",,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m kind, caring, and sweet. What’s Monica like?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.",,,,,Phoebe,
" She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn’t heard from",,,,,Phoebe,
" I don’t know, but we’re having dinner tomorrow night, so I",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, I’m gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. (Starts to spin) Ooh, y'know we could just do this. (She",,,,,Phoebe,
" Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody",,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on, take ‘em off!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Shhh! Shhhh! Joey’s asleep.,,,,,Phoebe,
" After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him",,,,,Phoebe,
 She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She’s",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, well, don’t ""Aww Pheebs, that sucks!"" me yet. (she starts",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, she’s out of town so, there’s gotta be something in her",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, are any of those people here?!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I’ll-I’ll fill her",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. (She manages to climb completely,,,,,Phoebe,
 No! No!! It’s me! It’s me! I-I didn’t want to make any noise!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m sorry.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge.",,,,,Phoebe,
 My Father is Chuck Magioni?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Heh?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ehh?,,,,,Phoebe,
" I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!",,,,,Phoebe,
 How close?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t even know how that would work!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (interrupting) I’m not asking!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. Let’s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, well, everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn’t even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I’m just, I’m gonna do the same thing to you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t ever want to see you again! ,,,,,Phoebe,
" (walking back in with her hand over her eyes.) Umm, where’s my purse?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, umm, my Mom’s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner! (starts to go upstairs)",,,,,Phoebe,
" No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (turning around, insistently) Monica!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here! (Sees Ross and Rachel cuddling on the couch.) Oh. Are you? Are you?!! (they nod ‘Yes.’) Ohh! That’s so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. (they nod ‘No.’) But for you, yay! Ohh.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I’m gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, well umm, I know that we haven’t talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (shocked) You know her?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods ‘Yes.’) Well, do you still have it?",,,,,Phoebe,
 I can’t believe you didn’t tell me there was a suicide note!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I, umm, shut up!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (reading from the note) “Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I’ll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.” You just wrote this!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Noooo!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 No. I’m-I’m to depressed to talk.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing) “...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm.” (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you. You go away.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, bye.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
" But, it’s not like we’re losing anything. Y'know?",,,,,Phoebe,
 It’s not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I-I like pizza!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, so do I!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I’m-I’m mad at you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (screaming, angrily) ...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! (applause) (happily) Thank you, thanks.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I actually don’t know...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! (goes over and picks up the cat) Come on. Crazy. (looks into the cat’s eyes) Oh my God.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Nothing. Nothing.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No Dr. Skeptismo! I’m sure. First of all, okay, there’s the feeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) My Mother’s favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands, but then nods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (to the cat) Hi, Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth, in an “Oh my God.” gesture) Oh, I haven’t seen this smile in 17 years!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I’m not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there’s y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she’s worried that y'know, she’s gonna, she’s gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice) Well, that’s not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monica’s room)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering, with Julio) Hi. (sits down in the chair)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
" So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I just feel so, uhh.....",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah? (sees Ross) Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross, how many parents have you lost?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, then you don’t know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I’m wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I think she would like that.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank you. We both forgive you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you’re welcome to come back anytime.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on, Mom, I’ll take you home.",,,,,Phoebe,
 How come?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I didn’t hear that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow! And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian! (Gives her a thumbs up)",,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s weird.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Your nails.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine now.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store, I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’re gonna look great. (She runs over to get her coat.) Oh! Oh, it’s ‘cause they’re gonna eat—that’s the problem.",,,,,Phoebe,
 And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t get it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Op, the ruined quiches are ready.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 This used to be your room? (She nods ‘Yes’) Wow! You must’ve been in really good shape as a kid.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, ""Yeah, he pulled a Monica."" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, ""Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica."" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, ""Yeah, that one’s outta here."" Though some things don’t change.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! My breasts are really strong. (She goes and joins Monica.),,,,,Phoebe,
 They’re not even touching the lasagna!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, they love your casserole.",,,,,Phoebe,
 It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. (They both look at her) (to Monica) She doesn’t know we switched it. (Monica nods her head ‘No.’)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey! New wallet, huh?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh please, somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional. (She starts to leave)",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t what your talking about. (Laughs nervously and continues to leaqve),,,,,Phoebe,
 Because it’s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!,,,,,Phoebe,
 These old things.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You mean the—Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y’know, real (lifts up the towel) nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh. (She goes to work, and her head slowly drops out of view.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 No!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.",,,,,Phoebe,
 On the touchy.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I know! I-I’m sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (thinking to herself) Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little… Oh no—wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick’s pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that’s working.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (thinking to herself) Chandler’s knees. Chandler’s… ankles. Chandler’s ankle hair. (notices the clock) Oh no. (to Rick) Okay, you’re all set.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! In… really long hour world.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you’re a client, I can’t ask you out, even though you give me y’know, the feeling.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (laughs) Okay, quit down. (they start to kiss again)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn’t what it looks like, ‘cause Rick is my ahh, husband.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, I will tell her.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.",,,,,Phoebe,
" It’s so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y’know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It’s been a really bad day, whore wise.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, they thought I was a whore.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Great! Thank you very much.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank you.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (in a nasally voice, from her cold) But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. (She puts her shoe on the table, and it's horribly decorated) Pretty, huh? (Sneezes)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. (Starts to sing) Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? (Stops singing) This chick sounds good. (Singing) Smelly cat, smelly--(stops singing) Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing, drunk) My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. (Coughs really loudly.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that ""Woo-hoo"" thing.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, cute one!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, (clears her voice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, (tries to sing) My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You mean you stole it! (Monica sneezes again) Don't cover your mouth when you do that!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering) Hi! It's me. And soup. (to Rachel) Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (picking up Monica's used Kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) Sure.,,,,,Phoebe,
" But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.",,,,,Phoebe,
 It's okay. How's the soup?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing) Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. (to Gunther) Does it even work without my sexy voice?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Gunther, kiss me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (singing) And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey what are you guys looking at?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, come to papa.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oo! Is it for my birthday present?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?",,,,,Phoebe,
 'Kay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, and what a great way to say, ""I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!""",,,,,Phoebe,
 It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... (Monica looks almost puzzled) ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?",,,,,Phoebe,
" There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, but I'm doing this.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Mon! I'm so happy for you!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I'll have one, please. Plus my money.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes. Did you settle the bill?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, look what we almost left. (Picks up a coffee maker)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!",,,,,Phoebe,
" But Mon, you have to get our money!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, ""that massage wasn't long enough, or, ""I don't recognize any of those songs,"" or, you know, ""these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!""",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.",,,,,Phoebe,
 She seems fine now.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You didn't get the money, did you?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! (Phoebe goes into the living room.) Hey, widow?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, Widow!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Excuse me. Excuse me! (Mrs. Bukart stops singing) Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Good. (Phoebe and Mrs. Burkart go into the other room, leaving Monica with everyone staring at her.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh... yay!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. I'm a hard ass.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing) ""Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease…"" Darn it! Now, I don’t know who to get to the next verse.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?",,,,,Phoebe,
" I wanna hear ""The Sound.""",,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on, play that funky music white boy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, it was so—wow!",,,,,Phoebe,
" What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (pushing Monica back onto the couch) It’s so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, I’m not playing tonight.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I can’t follow Ross! It’d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, he’s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I…",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no. No-no-no, don’t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Does Joey know?,,,,,Phoebe,
" I think maybe, yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! No, that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Look everyone, it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it’s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let’s trade!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You don’t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren’t here, you can watch the parade if you want.",,,,,Phoebe,
" God, what happened?!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Open it up, let me see.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, God it looks bad.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Honey, you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (on phone) Hi! Yeah, I’m calling on behalf of Monica Geller’s eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) He’s out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes! She’s very excited about that.,,,,,Phoebe,
" This is so cool, ‘til Monica gets back, it’s like I’m head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and then decides to add it to the dish.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, get out of my kitchen!",,,,,Phoebe,
 All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I can see where I’d be your best shot but, no. I’m sorry, but I think it’s twisted.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, ""That’s not how your dad used to do it.""",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I’ll get it. (goes over to the door.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, he-he can’t talk right now.",,,,,Phoebe,
 He’s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.,,,,,Phoebe,
 They were threefold.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, she sees him! Oh, they’re hugging!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, there they are!",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, get a room.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okayyyyy, open up!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, it’s for our catering business!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, we’re gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.",,,,,Phoebe,
" And also, we don’t know what to do with this. (She turns on a switch and the girl’s nipples light up.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.",,,,,Phoebe,
" How could you say yes, what about our catering business?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, in that case—(hops up and down in joy)—Yay! (Monica looks confused) That was me hopping on board.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay! (reading) ""Would I go back to Allesandro’s? Sure, but I’d have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head."" (to Monica) Wow! You really laid into this place.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No-no, it’s okay. But are we sure we don’t want the waterbed?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, all right. (starts to leave)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Bye!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (on intercom) Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, Monica!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I don’t know, it would totally depend on her coloring and… (realizes) You got the job!!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.",,,,,Phoebe,
 But we’ve only had one job.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! What are you saying?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You’re the cook! With out you it’s just me driving up to people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!,,,,,Phoebe,
 For what? I can’t believe this! I gotta get out of here. (leaves),,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I’m hearing.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I wa-I wa-I wa…,,,,,Phoebe,
 Monica!,,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?! Are you sure?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let’s plan the wedding reception. (She grabs the notebook which Monica used for her ideas and starts flipping page after page after page after page after page to find a blank one.) Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. (pause) Y’know what, I want you to take the chef job.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. That’s what you really want. Yeah, I don’t want to be the reason you’re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. (Joey, with an obvious mouth full, nods yes.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Where were you?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, which museum?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (just Phoebe) No, answer his.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, that paper’s two weeks old.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What’s wrong Mon?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘Quiet, bitch.’",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey! You guys, I’m writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing) Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yay!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know but it’s so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!,,,,,Phoebe,
" All good, thanks. (to Rachel) Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that’s easier to rhyme?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (shocked) You work with robots!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No! No, the robots just work for them.",,,,,Phoebe,
" If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing) Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry…",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" So! Ross doesn’t really decorate his tree with floss, but you don’t hear him complaining do you? God! (Phoebe hits her guitar which wakes up Ross with a start.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" So, did you pick one yet?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re done!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.",,,,,Phoebe,
 There’s sooo much you don’t know.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing) ""Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap.",,,,,Phoebe,
 My little brother is married!,,,,,Phoebe,
" You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait, wait. Why were you at the courthouse?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother. Now I have a sister too!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. Okay. Stop it. Don't!,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, ooh, I'm going to get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?",,,,,Phoebe,
" That's a really *nice* gift. I was thinking of, like, a gravy boat.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Guess what? Frank Jr. and Alice got married.,,,,,Phoebe,
 And they're going to have a baby!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! And they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Eww! And no, no! They want me to be the surrogate. It's her egg and his sperm. I'm just the oven. It's totally their bun.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, they said I had to think about it first. But what is there to think of? I'm going to be giving someone the greatest gift you can possibly give.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, what's your point? [goes to sit on the couch]",,,,,Phoebe,
" You know, you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.",,,,,Phoebe,
" My mom never gave birth. Oh, but my birth mom did!",,,,,Phoebe,
 [enters] Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Sorry I'm late.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, you really go all out for company.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, OH! Oh, I didn't know you did...pot.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, ooh! Erotery!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. [they both sit on the couch],,,,,Phoebe,
 Why not?,,,,,Phoebe,
" [gasps] Oh, I understand. Don't, don't hurt the puppy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I get a puppy?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why? [the puppy starts wriggling in her arms and she plays with him],,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. [puts the puppy in her lap and tries not to play with it.],,,,,Phoebe,
 [sighs softly],,,,,Phoebe,
 [playing with puppy again] Mom: I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, it's okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you know what? I think it's time for the puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go on the balcony. [gets up with puppy]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. [to everyone] Oh, listen, don't go on the balcony until I get back. [leaves]",,,,,Phoebe,
" My mom's going to be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.",,,,,Phoebe,
" [groans] My mom was right. If I can't give *him* up, there's no way I can give up a little baby. Frank and Alice are going to be so crushed. What, what else can I give them? A kidney?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, why don't you?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-huh, yeah!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I'm really okay with this. You know why? Cause look at them. [Frank Jr. and Alice are laughing and playing with the puppy.] Look how happy there are. And I made that. I know it's going to be like a million times harder to give up a baby but oh my God! It's going to feel like a million times better, right? [Rachel and Monica look at her; both are teary]",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm going to carry their baby.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, I know. You and I are totally different people. And this is a totally different situation. And I know that I'm not going to regret this.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn’t be living in an apartment.,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right. I’m gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I’m ready to have Frank and Alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, they’re just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay everyone, think thick.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi! Wish me luck!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Embryossss? As in, ""More than one?""",,,,,Phoebe,
" Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?",,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, well y’know what, don’t worry you guys, ‘cause I’m-I’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Whoa!! That—okay, that’s a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. (to Dr. Zane) So, well okay, so is there—is maybe is there something that I can do y’know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! You guys really don’t know anything!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I’m-I’m Phoebe Buffay, hi! I’m-I’m-I’m hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we’re doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you’ve been there! Umm, y’know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I’ll keep you safe and warm until you’re ready to have them take you home, so… Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I’m screaming, don’t worry, that’s what’s supposed to happen.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh. (To the embryos) Good luck.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they’re implanted.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, freaked. ‘Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice’s like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, I’m gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body’s always been a little faster than Western medicine.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Nope, not knocked up yet.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I’m gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I’m just gonna y’know, lie it your chair, (She climbs into the chair and drapes her feet over the back of the chair.) Y'know? Yeah, good, I’m let gravity y’know, do its jobs.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing) ""Are you in there little fetus?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh. Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y’know just remember that it’s still really early, okay so, if it says that I’m not pregnant, that doesn’t mean that I’m not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don’t go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Great. (Goes to take the test.),,,,,Phoebe,
 You guys! You guys! You’re gonna have a baby! They’re gonna have a baby!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, but this can’t be good for the baby.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?,,,,,Phoebe,
 That sounds great!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh! How was Kathy’s play?,,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s a good idea for a business!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh-okay, I get the game now.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh. (Joey flips the pancake and Phoebe catches it and throws it on her plate.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Rachel has a new doll.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, what do I smell?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh! (They all go over to her apartment),,,,,Phoebe,
 What? What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, but…",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I don’t need it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?",,,,,Phoebe,
" If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out here!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, are we gonna trash that place?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wait a minute.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why don’t you ask him out?,,,,,Phoebe,
 He just got a divorce right?,,,,,Phoebe,
" So he’s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (shocked) You’ve never asked a guy out?!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, please!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’ve never done that.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, sorry.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Great!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh good!,,,,,Phoebe,
 How? How is your fault?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (holding a lure) So now, what is this now?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (laughs and picks up another lure) And this?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (laughs harder) You make it so funny.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Don’t you just love the way they talk?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohh!,,,,,Phoebe,
 It kicked! I think the baby kicked!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (going over to comfort her) Aww, Pheebs.",,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Shhh!! Please! What’s he saying?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What? Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, look, why don’t you just, why don’t you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m sorry. (Goes and hugs him),,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, ‘cause I’m pregnant.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ha-ha, it’s not my baby, ha-ha-ha! (He leaves.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (doing the same) I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Come on! Look where you are!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Remember, a virgin for me please.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, if you think it will help.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You should! How is she?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Who, Josh?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y’know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren’t great at being guys, but you know why? Because we’re girls.",,,,,Phoebe,
 And do you know what girls are really good at?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, listening! Sit! Y’know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! What is that? What is that?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey—ooh so, how was Vermont?",,,,,Phoebe,
" I-I wanna be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) I like her.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohhh, wow.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?! I thought you were crazy about her!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yep!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, that’s so freaky! Turn him off!!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (whispering to Ross) Janice.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, why are you doing this anyway?",,,,,Phoebe,
 You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny. (Realises) Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (to the player) Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No offence but, y’know sometimes it’s hard to understand you, y’know with the accent, so…",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, poor baby.",,,,,Phoebe,
 She’s right! You have to stop!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Now, are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee and the ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 See? I’m doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops working.) I lost it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I-I can’t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I’m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake—ooh! Cake! (Chandler shrugs, and Phoebe grimaces.) No.",,,,,Phoebe,
 God! Ooh! What is that smell? It’s coming from the bathroom. Ooh! (She goes to the bathroom.),,,,,Phoebe,
" It’s me. It’s Phoebe. Listen there’s something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (she smells his head) No!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes. Yes. Yes. I can’t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can’t eat meat!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y’know? And I got nauseous.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.,,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow too.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oooh, yeah. You’re a genius.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded murder.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, totally!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’m gonna eat like, y’know millions of cows.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Pastrami.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Six months.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Not if I get there first.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering, carrying her massage table) Hi!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, I’m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y’know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. (She goes over and stands in front of the TV.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 You mean like a doctor?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Why don’t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I’ll hold onto your card, okay?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Three? You guys were worried I wouldn’t even have one!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I’m going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it’s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What do you know?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh! Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you’re umm, you’re walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, ""Oh, that’s nice?""",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, yeah well, good news, you’re going to have three babies.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh God, I’m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no maybe ‘cause it’s harder to raise them, and the added expense, and…",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, back to happy. Back to happy!",,,,,Phoebe,
 No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You can’t give up on your dream.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about, ‘cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering carrying a case) Ooh, good, you’re hear! Okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh this, well I’m glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a knife and an soda can.) Now, don’t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now, I know what you’re thinking…",,,,,Phoebe,
 No!,,,,,Phoebe,
 No!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.",,,,,Phoebe,
 My Saturn dealership.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m telling it! I’m telling it!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I’ve got?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No! Think about it, it’s a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it’s…",,,,,Phoebe,
 The name was my favourite part!,,,,,Phoebe,
 YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s not good.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that’s better than Relaxi Cab.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, that is better.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.) No, it’s just I’m so pregnant that I—my guitar doesn’t fit anymore. So I thought ‘til I’m not, I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Listen. Listen. (She starts to play and sing.) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know! I know, and I’ve only been playing for like an hour!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! What are you doing here?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! That’s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book (Holds up a book) and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like, y’know strong and confident, y’know? Like-like Exxon.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with ""The.""",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But, all right, I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.",,,,,Phoebe,
" God, Susan is so fun!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No! No! I-I meant for the baby!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y’know…",,,,,Phoebe,
" So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s like y’know, Chanoey?",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, Gene.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Bye, Gene.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, Carol really messed you up!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. (They all look at her.) All right, so I don’t know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then ’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Drum roll.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You’re actually going through with this?,,,,,Phoebe,
" You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact—yes, (To Joey) I’m, I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yay!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yay—oh—yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, uh… (She grabs her coat and runs out.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, bye!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering, wearing Santa pants) Hello!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Excuse me.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah! You like ‘em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Nuh-uh! They’re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. (Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists who’s been naughty and who’s been nice.) See, these names are good, and these names are bad. (Finally, she figures it out.) Ohh.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know—You’re clothes aren’t funny.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Boy! I didn’t see that coming!,,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s too hard. Too hard!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Or you could end up with everything.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh—oh, I have a game!",,,,,Phoebe,
 This is great!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, well, it doesn’t have a name—oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn’t have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Good! Good! Five points!,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, Joey, same question.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I have cards!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! Here! (She grabs a deck out of her purse) Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What make you think I can?! (Shields her eyes from it.),,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! (She fans out the trick deck.) Ah-ha!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.) (Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I don’t feel good about it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s so funny to think if you’d just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, scarf’s done. (It’s not really a scarf, it’s just a bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with them Joey and Chandler.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, the Olympics.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I still cannot believe you’re engaged! (Ross looks at her) Just ‘cause its happening so fast; not ‘cause you’re such a loser.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Already?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but y’know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You’re the most beautiful bride I’ve ever seen.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No-no, let me in!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, you have to let me in right now!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (catching it) I got it! Mine! (They both hug),,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank you!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay! (Gets into position) Okay, ready?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. (Phoebe turns and throws it on the couch.),,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m not gonna right to you! That’s not real!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I think we are.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, at least you didn’t rent yours from a store called, ""It’s Not Too Late.""",,,,,Phoebe,
 Me too.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Me too.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yay!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I hate my regular clothes now! Y’know? I look down and-and I know that this isn’t gonna be the most special day of my life.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I guess.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you’re such a cheater!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, how’d that happen?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What is that?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, how did it go?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What did he say?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, maybe.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Any luck?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (looks at Monica) Hey, y’know what might cheer you up?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Not after this!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What-what’s up?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y’know you can die. And, you would die!",,,,,Phoebe,
 So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oooh look! Isn’t this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross’s wedding?",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m so jealous you’re all going! I can’t believe I never knew that you can’t fly in your third trimester!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Remembered what?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.",,,,,Phoebe,
" See, he's her lobster.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (angrily) That’s like the tenth time I’ve peed since I’ve been here!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, oh I’m sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it’s a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I’m so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, ‘cause—Oh! I’m pregnant!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (starting to cry) Thank you so much.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I haven’t really had any yet.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (to her babies) Stop it!,,,,,Phoebe,
 One of the babies is kicking.,,,,,Phoebe,
" It’s not kicking me, it’s kicking one of the other babies. Oh (looks down her dress)! Don’t make me come in there!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!! (Joey walks back in, scared.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" I can’t believe I’m gonna have a party! This is so great! (Really excited) A party! (Really, really excited) Yay!! (Suddenly, she starts crying and Rachel moves to comfort her.) I don’t know why.",,,,,Phoebe,
" What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can’t use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what’s my next present?!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hi, guys.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet. (She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Good. Y’know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels like everything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, let’s see, it’s not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y’know a bunch of y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (sips it) It’s so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of relief.) Oh, thanks.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, do you see any babies?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I guess. I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess I know it’s going to be over soon.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re, when you’re done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing. I’m gonna be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay that’s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like, it’s like I know them y’know, I mean-I mean, it’s just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!,,,,,Phoebe,
 They are gonna love me.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thanks you guys! Again.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You’re the best. Thanks. Oh!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Just kidding. Ahh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Got cha again, you guys are so easy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, okay, but Rachel’s gonna be here too, can’t I just ask her this stuff?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don’t—can’t get up.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, have a great wedding!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it’s on the counter in your apartment.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (laughs) Thank you.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank you. (She pats him on his head.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, do you need a hug? You don’t have to bring me anything!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh. Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, no. Oh, nothing.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I have a wedgie.",,,,,Phoebe,
" So-so, what do you want for lunch?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I do. What’s the matter?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married…",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.",,,,,Phoebe,
 We thought you knew!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, Ross doesn’t know anything.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean.""",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I think I can help you get over him.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.,,,,,Phoebe,
 And a small piece of chocolate.,,,,,Phoebe,
 And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn’t feel like getting up. Okay, I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you’re going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he’s such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs it out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you’re with Ross okay and imagine that you’re kissing him. And you’re-you’re running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it’s some kind of grease, it’s—uck! Hah?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let’s try some uh, aversion therapy.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay?,,,,,Phoebe,
" So uh, now look at the picture…",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, and umm… (She grabs the picture and smacks her in the head.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, how do you feel now?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hello.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi!’ but then I figured, he doesn’t care if he looks like you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, they’re having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn’t been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?",,,,,Phoebe,
 So you’re not homesick yet?,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, the seven of us miss you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y’know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies…",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, the pizza guy’s here!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. But y’know we were thinking about you, y’know we ordered the Joey Special.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, it’s in the guys’ apartment under the sink. Why?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?! What do you mean you’re going to London?,,,,,Phoebe,
" I—Rachel, you can’t go! Ross loves Emily!",,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s not why you’re going! You’re going because you hope he’s gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy.""",,,,,Phoebe,
" No! Because he’s in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y’know, it’s too late! You missed you’re chance! I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I do! I do! I do! (Chases her into the hall, but Rachel doesn’t stop.) I do! (Gives up.) Ugh, like I can really chase you. I’m carrying a litter.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily’s Parents’ house.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (In a British accent) This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it’s not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No no no, I’ll be nice, I swear!!!   Could you just give me the number for where they are?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don’t give me that number then I’m going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (Looking relieved. She puts down the phone.) Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don’t want to talk about it, that’s fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...",,,,,Phoebe,
 (Trying to get up.) Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! (Not able to get up.) God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross’s sister Monica.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I’m Phoebe Buffay. I’m one of Ross’s best friends.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, um, I can’t fly. I’m having my brother’s babies.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It’s very very important.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh! Okay, I’m going to have to kick her ass too.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (Angrily.) Hey, were the hell have you been?!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t want to hear about her!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel’s coming to London.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No it’s not great. No, she’s coming to tell Ross that she loves him.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She’s going to ruin the wedding!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, so, okay...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, so I’m done my part, okay. It’s your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?",,,,,Phoebe,
 So tell me about this girl?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It’s Phoebe again.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Did you stop Rachel?,,,,,Phoebe,
 So nothing got ruined?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh that’s so great! Ohh, so what’s going on now?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen. (Joey looks at Ross and holds the phone above Ross’s shoulder.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (On the phone, in New York) Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller’s personal physician, Dr. Philange.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I’ve discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women’s names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hello?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hi, so what happened?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I know, but I don’t think that means anything.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Joey) You ate meat! (Joey is shocked) (To Chandler and Monica) You had s*x! (They’re shocked.),,,,,Phoebe,
" I know you didn’t, I was talking about Monica.",,,,,Phoebe,
 This pregnancy is throwing me all off.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, me too!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver…",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway…",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat--I don't want to talk about it.",,,,,Phoebe,
 So you still hadn't heard from Emily?,,,,,Phoebe,
 London is stupid! Stupid!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me. (She picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. Monica can't watch.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it felt French.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (excited) Central…(not so excited) Park!,,,,,Phoebe,
" That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? ""Well, it's right by my house, all right!""",,,,,Phoebe,
" That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, woo! Hi.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! (She starts out the door.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait, wait, remember when my water broke? (They all high-five again.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (to the nurse) Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (standing up) Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. (As she is talking Joey is sticking the camera under her skirt.) And then my mom wants to know-(notices Joey)-Joey, what are you doing?!",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, she's so stupid!",,,,,Phoebe,
" That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your v*g1n*!",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right--Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm having my first contraction!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, it's not bad.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!",,,,,Phoebe,
 No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either--Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! (Checks under the blanket.) Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (interrupting) What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi! And you're going into what grade?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (interrupting) Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!",,,,,Phoebe,
 They are. Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Happy birthday!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, it is.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Can I tell you a little secret?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I want to keep one. (Giggles in excitement.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, just ask him!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You're right.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Tell him it's for you.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Rachel) So did you ask him?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, doctor says any minute now.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 What is that?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I already had a baby. Leave me alone.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Which one do you have?,,,,,Phoebe,
" But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know…",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.",,,,,Phoebe,
" So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! (Imitates the high fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One of the babies begins to cry.) Well, if you're gonna cry. (She starts crying.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. You won't be able to take it.,,,,,Phoebe,
 They're gonna call her Chandler.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Works on you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ugh, PBS!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ugh, what's right with them?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.",,,,,Phoebe,
 All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!,,,,,Phoebe,
" This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What-what are you talking about?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. So?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, it's… Y'know there's—no you may not!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you calling me selfish?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Right. (She turns and opens her eyes in shock.),,,,,Phoebe,
" I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh-ohh!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (on phone from Central Perk) Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (Thinks for a moment.) Aw, dammit! (Slams the phone down.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, it's not a toy.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (on phone) Hi Joey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel—Oh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore it's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah that's better than my way.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Chandler) Can you hear anything?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, Madlibs, mine! (Grabs it.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ehh!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Come where?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, but try and get Joey too.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, sure! (She gets up to leave.) Bye Ross! (Whispering behind his back.) Forever.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.",,,,,Phoebe,
 We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, ""Hi, Phoebe!""",,,,,Phoebe,
 Count for what?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Eeeee-(She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it's a fur coat.)-ohh!! God! (She throws it at Joey.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.,,,,,Phoebe,
 That might work! (She gives him the coat.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?",,,,,Phoebe,
" He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.",,,,,Phoebe,
" This is fashion?! (Grabs the coat from Rachel.) Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. (She puts the coat on and starts to model it.) Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? (Sees herself in the mirror.) 'Cause I do.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Nooo!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I know.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. (She puts on her fur coat.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I—it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! (She starts to leave but stops and says to Monica.) Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you still mad at us?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh good! Because we have an ""I'm sorry"" song.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Chandler) You're kinda stepping on the song. (She gets ready to play but is stopped by…),,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes! Exactly! And that's why…,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh God, I really missed that fat b*st*rd!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi Emily!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Here. (She wraps her coat around his shoulders.),,,,,Phoebe,
" (to the squirrel) Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! (The squirrel stares at her.) All right, fine, now I get it. (To the clerk.) Here. (She hands him her coat.) You take it. (To the squirrel.) Are you happy now? I'm cold!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?",,,,,Phoebe,
 It's okay to laugh right?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. (She laughs harder.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Yum-my!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. (To Larry) Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 He's so funny! (She imitates what he just did.),,,,,Phoebe,
 (smiles) Show me the badge again.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Shiny.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (laughing) You are just nonstop!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (awed) You have the power to do that?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (excited) Shut it down.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, ""See you ladle."" (Laughs.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, absolutely!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So, no.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Enh. Sure!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That—this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. (She takes a swig of it, but has to turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) Okay, let's go!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Thank you. (To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Okay, go! Go! Go! (He runs off.) (To Larry) Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Does anyone wanna watch TV?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Monica your remote doesn't work.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh. Aw, forget it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (surprised) Hello?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Joey? What's going on?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What am I sitting on?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (taking something out of the couch) Ew-eww!! Undies!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! Okay—ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?",,,,,Phoebe,
" This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. (Writes him a note and the gang reads it.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, he stabbed me first!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I thought you said you read it in high school.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Rachel) You completely stole my answer!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Would you care to venture one?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you just repeating what I'm saying?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay then.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You didn't read this one either?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 No! You should've read it yourself!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (smiling) I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!",,,,,Phoebe,
 What's going on?,,,,,Phoebe,
 So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't know! I didn't come with her!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey you guys, guess what?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, you and your ways. (She shakes the bell at him and sits down.) Since it’s Christmastime. I’m going to be one of those people collection donations.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (Excitedly) Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, yeah, I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I’m going to do the whole city.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I’m the only one who can sing ""Merry Christmas"" in 25 languages. (She smirks.) I lied.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. (A man put some change in her bucket.) Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy. (She waves her hand up and down as if she is spreading joy.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it's going okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, thanks!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Just get your nails done?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. (She waves her arm and spreads her joy.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank you! And Happy Holidays.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait, you can't take the money out.",,,,,Phoebe,
" But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still…",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just… (She scowls at him.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Thank you, Happy Holidays.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't… (The lady ignores her and walks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yet another guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that. (She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What is that?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) It's nine o'clock in the morning!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Does it look like an ashtray?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Does it look like a urinal?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry. (Leaves.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. (The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws the lint away.) What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his face.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-worker walk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.) I thought I told you to get outta here!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 That chick can't handle my corner.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Fine. (She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.) (The same old lady walks by again.) All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch. (The old lady.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?",,,,,Phoebe,
 You too!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?! How come?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I taught me and I love me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hornswoggle? (To Chandler) Ooh, this must be killing you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. (Joey tries to take the guitar.) Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, (Points to her head.) then you learn here. (Points to the guitar.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. (She starts to show Joey the chords. Transcribers Note: For this one you'll have to use your imagination, 'cause it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. So if you want to see them, you'll have to wait for this episode to come to a TV near you.) (Holding up her hand and then reconfiguring her hand with each name.) So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady. (Joey tries to imitate them.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! (They both laugh at what she said.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Give me your hands. (He does and she smells his left hand.) Strings. Gimme it! (He gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.) Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Then don't touch one!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Tiger! (Joey moves his hand in an attempt to do the chord, in fact he does it with each name.) Dragon! Iceberg!! (He fails.) Joseph, did you even study at all last night?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Then do Iceberg!,,,,,Phoebe,
 G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? (Joey doesn't answer.) Have you? (He looks away in shame.) Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, but you're questioning my method!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, fine! Take his side! (Storms out.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh!,,,,,Phoebe,
 No!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Bye! (She exits, leaving Rachel and Joey alone.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So…,,,,,Phoebe,
 That's weird. (Pause.) I bet they're doing it.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Exactly! Because it's in the past!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, then what happened?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) You'll get your turn!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.) This is not over!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What were you doing?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, nobody's judging you. (They all turn and look at Ross.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 You two will have very hairy children.,,,,,Phoebe,
 So are you actually gonna see her again?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-hmm.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohhh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you serious?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We…",,,,,Phoebe,
" (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, tough call.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.",,,,,Phoebe,
" It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; ""Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter."" And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.",,,,,Phoebe,
 It's Phoebe.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, well, umm Grandma died.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No you didn't!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert. (Starts to leave.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (notices his bag.) Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Thanks!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, welcome.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Umm here's your 3-D glasses.,,,,,Phoebe,
 So how did you know Francis?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?! What's your name?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You're Frank Buffay?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You just said…,,,,,Phoebe,
 But…,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
 That was my dad!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" He said, ""Nice to meet you Glenda."" (They stare at her, dumbfounded) Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.",,,,,Phoebe,
 All right.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!",,,,,Phoebe,
" As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (seeing the look on Chandler's face) He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, thank you for meeting with me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Come, sit. (He's hesitant.) Sit. (Still hesitating.) Sit! (He sits on the arm of the couch.) Umm, all righty, before we get started I just—I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Huh?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yes. Yes. Yeah—no. She did. She left you umm, (looking in her purse) this lipstick.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. (She picks up a couple of crumpled receipts.) Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. See? (Quickly shows him.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 But you-you-you came to see Lilly?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Lilly's dead. (He looks up in shock.),,,,,Phoebe,
 She's dead.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.",,,,,Phoebe,
 17 years ago.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, (pause) is on this couch.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.",,,,,Phoebe,
 That's a defense?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You make up songs?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I am. (Moves over and takes his hand.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Not yet, no. (Drops his hand and moves back.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (looking out the window) Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!",,,,,Phoebe,
 It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 YOU KNOW?!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and Rachel.),,,,,Phoebe,
 You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or—Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.,,,,,Phoebe,
 No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.",,,,,Phoebe,
 And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (feels his arm) Yeah the material feels so soft—hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, if you really wanna know, I'm—Oh! I can't tell you this.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I have quarters! (She holds up a bag of quarters.),,,,,Phoebe,
 But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?",,,,,Phoebe,
 He broke that.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from Rachel.) Hello you.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Eh?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?,,,,,Phoebe,
" I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!",,,,,Phoebe,
 No!,,,,,Phoebe,
" God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey, you can't say anything!",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (laughs) Please.,,,,,Phoebe,
" So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!",,,,,Phoebe,
" And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses? (He begrudgingly does so.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Good idea!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh now, don't give away the farm!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Chandler.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I was going too. (They go inside and he closes the door.) Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?",,,,,Phoebe,
" So, here we are. Nervous?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I want this to happen.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you. (She starts doing a rather suggestive and seductive dance that's silly at the same time.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Here it comes. Our first kiss.,,,,,Phoebe,
 And why not?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You're-you're what?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!",,,,,Phoebe,
 God! (She turns and buttons up.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Bread, so you never go hungry.",,,,,Phoebe,
" And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Mr. President.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. I really like his glasses.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, hi Ross!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it’s a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man! (A guest walks up to her.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, okay, my bad.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (ignoring him and continuing her conversation) That's what I'm saying. (Laughs.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh. (Turns to him.),,,,,Phoebe,
" No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.",,,,,Phoebe,
 But somehow you came off as the bad guy.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand and Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, ""Who hear likes Ross,"" and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something woman, who're a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger, (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.",,,,,Phoebe,
 All right. Hold on. (She starts digging in the chair.) I got it. Nickel! (Donates it.) How much more do we need?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, dime! (Donates that.) You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. (Finds something else.) Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! (Looks at it.) Oh my God, this is a police badge!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! (She crosses her fingers in hope.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?",,,,,Phoebe,
 You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!,,,,,Phoebe,
 No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hold it! (Grabs the badge) N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah that's right you are so busted. (To no one in particular.) Book 'em.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. (The woman calls her bluff.) (Screaming at no one in particular) Backup! Backup!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!",,,,,Phoebe,
" …so this guy was all (Mumbles.) And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. (Flashes the badge.) It was just so cool!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You could get arrested, right now! (Flashes the badge and they glare at her.) All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. (She heads for the door just as Joey enters.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Joey) Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Excuse me, is this your car?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop. (Shows the badge.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, no. (Pause) Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4. (Tries to leave.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (starts to walk away, but stops) Don’t try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I-I sure will, take care. (Starts walking off.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh. (She starts laughing. Then she throws the badge at him and runs away.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you (Points at all of them) with me. (They all look at her.) Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. (She opens the door to the cop from before.) Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I would love it if I weren't here!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Me?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer…",,,,,Phoebe,
 Gary.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, impressive.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, I can't wait!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You wanna work on your interview skills?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Very good handshake, good wrist action.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. (They shake hands and she pulls away suddenly) Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?! (Rubbing her hand.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.",,,,,Phoebe,
 But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, then maybe I can come too!",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, you go. (They kiss.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" 'Kay, bye!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh God!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh I just miss him so much!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.",,,,,Phoebe,
 So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on, seriously! When did it end?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (Under her breath) God, I woke the beast. Sorry. (To Monica) I was wrong obviously, I just—I misspoke. It's okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh we can't, we already have plans.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You tired Chandler?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, (laughs) umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.",,,,,Phoebe,
 We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What are you talking about?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, great so do you want to do it together?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh good!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh good.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh wait, I change my mind! (She slams the door on them.) Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas! (Holds up a cocktail napkin.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, look at that.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What happened to the intimate dinner party?,,,,,Phoebe,
" So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Like what?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Cups? You're giving me cups?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? (Thinks of something) All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I got it! Mine!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering, carrying two garbage bags) Hey!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, cups.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. (She goes and opens the door to Joey.) Oh, hi Joey!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (To Chandler) Check it out! Cup hat! (Points to her hat.) Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! (Holds up one.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (following him) And did you notice the ice? (Gestures to 3 huge buckets of ice on the table.) Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! (Pours some water onto the dry ice, causing it to evaporate/smoke.) Ahhh! Mystical!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (noticing her) Oh, look! Look! Look!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I was in charge of cups.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Don't get me started on that.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (looking through the pizzas) Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!",,,,,Phoebe,
 See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.,,,,,Phoebe,
 This is so cool!,,,,,Phoebe,
 But I like it here!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay! (Walks over to Rachel) Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I guess so. (See, the brief possession didn't affect her at all, like we could really tell.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!",,,,,Phoebe,
 These are her earrings.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why not?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering from Rachel's bedroom) I found it!,,,,,Phoebe,
 On your dresser.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (smiling) Maybe your scene's coming up?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (smiling) This is terrible, what are you going to do?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (not smiling) That's not good.,,,,,Phoebe,
 But I already gave them back to you!,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. (Walks away over to Rachel.) Where is that other earring?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (she just looks at him) Why are you being weird?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, that would be, ""Why are you being cute?""",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohh! I did not get that.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Did you find it?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Rachel) What are we going to do?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! You're the best!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, right! (Hands Monica back her sunglasses.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 I-I-I found it interesting.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (walking over to Ross) Ross?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What else do they add smell too?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh no!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I am definitely gonna watch that!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Definitely!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, then no.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering, with Gary) Hey!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (excited) John Glenn is here?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" My God, Joey!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! Sure! Yep! (Gets up) Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Bye!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. (Gets up) But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. (Starts to leave.) (To Joey) Not you Joey.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm fine, thanks.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Nope. (Chandler nods in agreement.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. Bye!,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, what movie should we see?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?! Really?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I can't believe this!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, but it is fast. Isn't it?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't know. I'll just handle it—I'll ask you to talk to him!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a…man!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh!! God! (Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler) Get out of here, good for nothing.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! Okay. (They move to the couch.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Thanks! Okay. (They sit down.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-hmm.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this. (She stays still for a brief second.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
 That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just—I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Which is why my answer is yes!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh! (They hug.) I'm so…happy. (She's not happy.),,,,,Phoebe,
 We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, I'm so excited!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, nothing.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool. (Turns away from him.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (sits down) Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. (Pause) Can I get some water?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, yeah! Today's.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (looks at the paper) Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! (Pause) I'm sorry! (Puts her head down.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
 That's so sweet.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Living with you would make me happy.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in! (Hugs him.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh wait, one sec. One sec. (Goes to the mirror) Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, (sees the look on his face) which was never!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I like waking up with you too. (Looks out the window) Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. (Some birds are singing outside the window) Oh, I can stay here all day.",,,,,Phoebe,
 We could have breakfast in bed…,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. (He grabs his gun and shoots the bird.) Oh! Oh no.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering) Oh good, you're all up.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, that's over.",,,,,Phoebe,
 He shot a bird!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (catches it) Nah, I don't feel like playing. (She sets the ball down on the table and everyone gasps.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, give him a kiss for me!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Bye!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (after he's gone) I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?",,,,,Phoebe,
 You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, ""Ross"" on it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh-oh, chilling!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh hey Joey! What's up?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I've been around.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}",,,,,Phoebe,
 But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. (Quickly) Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?,,,,,Phoebe,
 No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?,,,,,Phoebe,
 North route or south route?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Bamn! There you go! Huh?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, this guy again. (She ignores him.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, no thank you. (She gets up and moves to the couch. They were at a table previously.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Bye!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, if you don't know I can't help you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I can't help you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Apology accepted.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (quietly) Bye, fat ass.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't know! I don't remember!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
 No that made me feel precious.,,,,,Phoebe,
 That game should not be played without my supervision.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What's in the bag?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I do!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. (Thinks) Or-or Rachel!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, dude!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh that's my grandma. (Joey holds the box away from him.) And thanks Joey she's having a really great time. (Joey is happy now.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering… (We hear the dial tone as Joey hangs up.) Okay, I guess he ran out of change.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with p0rn!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-hmm.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Fauna.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Garfunkle.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You said I was boring--Ohh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! (Realizes) Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (smiles) Okay! (Goes to answer the phone.),,,,,Phoebe,
 (answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Joey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure! Where is it?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohh! So you're 5639?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Joey) Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Who was that?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! (She hands the phone to Chandler.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! (Starts looking around for her) Monica? (Goes into Monica's bedroom.),,,,,Phoebe,
 (saddened) It's okay. What the hell took you so long?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Which Richard?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?",,,,,Phoebe,
 That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.,,,,,Phoebe,
" But again, Simmons. Go on.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!,,,,,Phoebe,
 On a totally different bet.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I'm gonna go too!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Naked alone time.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, what about after I give you these candies? (Hands them each one from her purse.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ah-ha! Okay, (takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back. (Gets up and heads aft.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (sitting down) Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh no. [The patented version.],,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Monica under her breath) Simmons! Go with Simmons!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, London 1…",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey you guys wait! Guys! (Catches up to them.) This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!",,,,,Phoebe,
" For 99 cents, I'd eat you. (Sees the casino) Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! (Points to Joey in his gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) Oh! Look! Hi!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey! Joey! (They all head over to him, he spots them coming and panics.) Hey! Hey!! Wow! (She hugs him.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why are you dressed as a gladiator?,,,,,Phoebe,
 So you're a gladiator! Wow!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Monica had lunch with Richard.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Noo! But that would've been so cool!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I love Vegas!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thanks.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. (Monica turns and stares at her.) I am so sorry.,,,,,Phoebe,
 So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Sure! (When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling) Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, you are so lucky! (To Chandler) Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?",,,,,Phoebe,
 But she just came up here!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I wonder where she is. That is so weird.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Good. (After he leaves, she puts on Joey's gladiator helmet and checks herself out in the mirror) I should really start wearing hats!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (sees Ross and Rachel) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You guys are here! Yay!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (sees Rachel's face) What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? (Points at Rachel) and you're Bob Saget. (An old lady has sat down at the slot machine Phoebe was just at.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! (Motions to her face, indicating all of Rachel's ""make-up."")",,,,,Phoebe,
" Whoa, what kind of party was this?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ugh!,,,,,Phoebe,
 That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.,,,,,Phoebe,
 M-M-Mole people?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh. What's a lurker?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Kills you?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohhh!,,,,,Phoebe,
 How do you know about this?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Dance karate?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (seeing her) Get out of here you lurker! (She doesn't move) Go on! Get! (She throws a quarter at her.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohh! You made up!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, get a room.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know. Use it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh well, lost again. (She gets up and slowly moves away. The lurker scurries in and takes her spot, only this time Phoebe set a trap for her and catches her in the act.) That's it! You and me, outside!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Be cool! (They both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard walks by, but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) Okay lady, your lurking days are over!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What time? Maybe we can share a cab!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I won! I won! I finally won!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Fine! Here! Take a hike toots! (Gives back her quarter.),,,,,Phoebe,
 (quietly) Sells drugs to kids.,,,,,Phoebe,
 She sells drugs to kids. (The guard looks at the lurker.),,,,,Phoebe,
 How about we talk about this over dinner?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay. (Walks out.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering and sitting down at the table.) Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? (Looks down) Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay! Okay! Okay! (They run into the chapel.),,,,,Phoebe,
 (to her) Hey! Don’t you give me any of your—Hey! (Sees Chandler and Monica standing there.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, maybe you wouldn’t have had you (turns to the attendant) run in the chapel!",,,,,Phoebe,
" What’s the big deal, y’know? It’s not like it’s a real marriage.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you’re only married in Vegas.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (shocked) Really?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!—Eh! Well…,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh Joey, I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What about my cab?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I don’t know, it’s such a long trip.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right. Although I don’t think we need one, I never stopped loving you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Well you don’t.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Good! Good! I was just testing you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hell, I’m drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? I can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh-oh, that’s your thing.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy who gets divorced.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) I’m so drunk.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Come on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any (sees that he’s asleep) QUESTIONS!!!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Sing!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape—(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker’s face), a rapist or a killer or something!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (To the hitchhiker) And you, are you a rapist?!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Do you like car games?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I love the license plate game!,,,,,Phoebe,
 No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes the partition.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
" And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the ball’s pretty much in your court.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! Y’know I can’t resist that beautiful voice!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You can still sleep at night and stuff.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Is it a meatball sub?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No thanks, I’ve already seen one.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Always.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Always.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (running out) Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, there’s a cab! Taxi!! (The cab stops and she opens the door.) Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go. (Pushes Rachel in and closes the door.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! (She bangs on the cab’s roof and it pulls away.) (To Ross) You didn’t get the annulment?!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ross?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.",,,,,Phoebe,
" So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’t even know about it?!—Op, woman! Sorry.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Rachel is one of my closest friends. (Pause) Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey Rach!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! (Bangs on the roof again and off they go.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, why?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (gasps) You’re pregnant!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh! That’s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint: Phoebe.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Guys, I’m happy too.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled… (Winks at Ross.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three times, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates…",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn’t you date him?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldn’t you want a date?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (leaning to him) She said, ""He’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."" (He glares at her.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, ""Well done!"" Bravo Meg.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Joey and Chandler) Okay, bye!",,,,,Phoebe,
 So? Did you get the annulment?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I knew it! Because you love Rachel.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh we do, but not just yet.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.",,,,,Phoebe,
 But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-huh, what?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?",,,,,Phoebe,
 My roommate.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, Denise. Denise!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?",,,,,Phoebe,
 You didn’t tell her did you?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Of course not, because you’re in love with her.",,,,,Phoebe,
" What do you mean, comforted her?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. (Tries to take a bite out of Ross’s cookie.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! (Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) Oh come on Ross, you’re a scientist.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (taking his coffee) Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I didn’t understand that, but y’know, maybe that’s ‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Shhhhhh! I’m swamped right now.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, I’m trying to move that pencil. (There’s a pencil lying on the table.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 It worked!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait, no, look at this! (Points to one.) (Reading) ""Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay…"" Oh, yeah, but it’s on the ground floor.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I saw it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t admit. You love her again; you re-love her!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I can’t believe you won’t just admit it! (Pause) Okay, just promise me that you won’t do anything stupid.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow! I’m-I’m so happy for you guys. (To Ross) This is so-so, not stupid.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No. No, I won’t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that’s how she ended up living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Okay, that’s a lie.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (singing) I found you in my bed!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (on the microphone, accidentally) Yes.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ross, I know what you’re thinking.",,,,,Phoebe,
" That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 No! (Ross’s phone rings.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, Professor and Mrs.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! Yeah, y’know you and Ross are still married.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Just kidding!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Ross) Saved your ass.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, you know that psychic I see?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, she told me that I’m gonna die this week, so I’m kinda bummed about that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t—she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve only got a week left, y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now! (So she picks up the latest copy of Car and Driver (a U.S. auto magazine), leans back, and starts reading.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, this is it. This what’s gonna kill me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ugh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could—(Groans, hacks, and then freezes with her eyes open and her tongue hanging out.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 I was preparing you for my—didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What’s going on?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! Maybe you’ll die!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I’m not going die!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Because my psychic is dead! She must’ve read the cards wrong!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Eh, better her than me! Hey, let’s bake cookies!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Have you really done this before?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 We’re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (overdoing it) Oh my God!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Another lie. You have a sickness!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (coming in from the bathroom) Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, well I’ll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they’re not actually puppies, they’re Frank and Alice’s triplets. Okay, see ya! (Exits.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (stops) Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve never done that before by myself!,,,,,Phoebe,
" What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don’t have a roommate.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Maybe you could be my roommate!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, she said she’d be back December 26th.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (rapidly) I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you think they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",,,,,Phoebe,
" That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah? (Checking the final diaper) Well this is not what I ordered.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I can still do that.",,,,,Phoebe,
 How did that happen?!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.",,,,,Phoebe,
" What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting!",,,,,Phoebe,
 But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!,,,,,Phoebe,
" But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m pretty sure it’s gun.,,,,,Phoebe,
" A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital! (They don’t stop.) No! What would, what would Krog do? (They ignore her and Phoebe is left alone.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I’m gonna take that spit bubble as, ""Yeah, I do!"" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I’ll set you up with a clean one. (She throws it at the garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the floor and break.) Okay, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? ‘Cause let’s face it, we’re at Monica’s. (She crawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) I broke it. All right. Well, that’s just the way that goes. (She throws out both the flowers and the vase.) Okay, good. (She turns around and only counts two babies.) Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can’t answer. (She starts looking for her) Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! (She turns around and finds that Leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the TV cabinet.) Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! (She picks her up and notices a surprise is waiting in the drawer.) Oh, you’re a lot mischievous! Well, it’ll dry. (Closes the drawer with her foot.) (To Leslie) Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now—who aren’t there! (They both have disappeared as well.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (exhausted) How do you feel?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed ‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, the babies are asleep.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!,,,,,Phoebe,
 So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, how much do you think he needs?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.,,,,,Phoebe,
" And also, my birthday.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?,,,,,Phoebe,
" My God, I can’t get a minute of peace around this place.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I have plans.,,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s right.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves! (The guys scramble for the door.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time… (She starts laughing hysterically.) You don’t remember?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you’re not gonna miss.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on, there’s gotta be something.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Good! Great! You can go first.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y’know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Great! It worked! No one’s sad.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! I call her!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. (Phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, I took it hard too.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, how are you guys doing?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay, you guys… STOP!! (They stop.) I know that, I know that you’re acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. But deep down you’re still really sad. Deep-deep down.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, deep-deep-deep down!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Then keep running. (They resume the chase.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What else?,,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay Rachel, I can’t wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We’ll have so much fun!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh that’s right. You’re still set on that?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ready?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 it's...,,,,,Phoebe,
 and…,,,,,Phoebe,
 please...,,,,,Phoebe,
 leave…,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get ""it’s,"" ""and"" oh I'm sorry, I have ""A."" Forget it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, so let's switch.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi…,,,,,Phoebe,
 It's…,,,,,Phoebe,
 and…,,,,,Phoebe,
" Please...wait, how did you do that?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, let's go running!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Let's run towards them!,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. (Starts running crazily with her arms flapping and her legs far apart) Come on! That's not running! Let's go! (Rachel pauses, then follows, embarrassed.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why? Why would you do that?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (jumps in front of Rachel) Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Please Rachel, I am not an idiot. (Runs off)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, what should you have done?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-Huh, Which is...?",,,,,Phoebe,
 So?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why do you care?,,,,,Phoebe,
 But people that you don't know and will never see again.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss (panting). But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.",,,,,Phoebe,
" That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? (Rachel looks confused) The neighbor's dog.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (Walking over and Sitting down.) Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Rachel?,,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God. What happened?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well that’s great! Congratulations!! (She hugs Rachel.),,,,,Phoebe,
 (Hugging her again.) You’ve lasted a whole year. Good for you.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Totally.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we’re making out. You know.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No!,,,,,Phoebe,
" What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he’s married? (Rachel looks at her.) No, yeah, I should.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey. Here. (Hands Chandler a copy of her flyer and sees the picture of Ralph.) Ohh, who’s the silver fox?",,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, no, Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohhh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? (He smiles at her.) OH!! Demon!! Demon!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Just for a second.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, sleep with Kenny.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, yes it would.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel’s dessert is...[about to say “bad”] so good that I eat all of it. There’s none left for anybody else!",,,,,Phoebe,
 And who else is going to be there?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. Y’know, I mean he used to be just, y’know “Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad” and now he’s he’s “Jack Geller, dream hunk.""",,,,,Phoebe,
 Rachel?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn’t give to be that can of (looks closer to see what Jack is drinking) condensed milk.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Monica, leave him alone!",,,,,Phoebe,
" So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn’t it?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I can’t have any. You know I don’t eat meat. (Faking dissapointment.) Ohhh no.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Rachel, come here. (Rachel walks over to Phoebe. Chandler sits down on the lounge-chair.) Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I dunno, let’s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (joining in) I love Jacques Cousteau!,,,,,Phoebe,
 That is nice and we’re done. TADA!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No-no, we do it every year!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, yeah, we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily minx.",,,,,Phoebe,
 But we have to!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well then, you should look with us.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, that’s it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh ooh, we have a live one!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, who’s it for?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-oh. She may be onto us.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! Look who I found!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hmm, how about my azzz?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, don’t look directly at them!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, no, we could look at them!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, this one’s for Chandler. Here.",,,,,Phoebe,
 And the big one’s for me!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hee hee!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Will you get us better gifts?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.",,,,,Phoebe,
" She’s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah well, we’ll see.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (sees the table) Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, a flea market?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where (She’s opening and closing the drawers) they kept all the stuff to make their potions.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Y’know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.",,,,,Phoebe,
 How much was it?,,,,,Phoebe,
 500 bucks at a flea market?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh no.,,,,,Phoebe,
 A dollar?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, what period is it from?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, yes I do. God, oh it’s just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y’know where it was from or…",,,,,Phoebe,
" (gasps) White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Hey—Ooh, cool sheets! (Notices the sheet over the table.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure!,,,,,Phoebe,
" You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh sure! (She goes to take her feet off, but drags the sheet with her which spills the wine.) Noo!",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ross, where did you get this?!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow! Oh my God, well if they’ve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Well this doesn’t even smell like opium.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh Ross, calm down, I’ll give you the 80 cents. (Ross glares at Rachel)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (sees Ross) Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ah!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah no, I’m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No! I do want to!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!",,,,,Phoebe,
 No! Look-look! There’s the coffee table they stole from us!,,,,,Phoebe,
 That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the…wait a sec! This is our exact living room!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don’t have that lamp!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I can’t! I can’t! Unless… Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp?,,,,,Phoebe,
 But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy that lamp?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!,,,,,Phoebe,
 But at least the apothecary table is real.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I didn’t know Playboy prints jokes.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wh-wh-what are you doing?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I want to look too! (She runs over and sits down and checks out a picture). Yikes!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Rachel.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t know. (Pause) Me neither.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I guess it was kinda funny.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okay let’s go to lunch!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ya, you know, Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want. Y’know, you can just walk all over her.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay, (laughing) you’re not a pushover.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" That true, I am flaky.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, totally.",,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s great. Good for you guys.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Who said you were?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really? I’ve heard better.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Monica) Y’know, suddenly I find you very attractive.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! That is a bad audition.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (returning from the bathroom) Rach, you’re in my seat.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, well, I kinda thought.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah Joey that is so gross!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (giggles) I’m pretty.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh I do! (She grabs her huge purse and starts rummaging through it and taking out various items in a futile search for the gum.) Oh, y’know what? No. (Pause) Wait a second. (She removes a bag filled with water that has a goldfish swimming in it.) I know it’s in here somewhere.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Ross) Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that’s bitter?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Never mind, I got it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Of course, yeah!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, I like cards.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Seriously, I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I would love that job!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Sorry Jill.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh well, all right, I got (Ross hands her a bag) (To Ross) thank you, I got uh, this y’know ""I want a job sweater."" (Holds up the same sweater.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, you never heard of them?",,,,,Phoebe,
" What about, what about when I said y’know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (gets up and sits between them) Okay-okay, why don’t I sit here and you’ll both stop it!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay then.,,,,,Phoebe,
" But great news about the apartment pants, huh?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (crying) Yeah me too.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh y’know what’s sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, what’s going on there? (Points to a picture.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh Chandler!,,,,,Phoebe,
 So that story doesn’t make you cry?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh you’re my biggest fan? I’ve always wanted to meet you! Hi! (Shakes his hand.) Sure! Yeah! (Signs the autograph),,,,,Phoebe,
" You’re just saying that because you’re my biggest fan. (The fan leaves and Joey approaches.) (To Joey) Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? (Points) He’s a fan. (To the fan as she’s leaving) Bye! (Exits)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey! What’s up? (Sees the TV) Oh my God! What am I doing?!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (seeing her dress) Oh God. So-so you’re making p0rn movies.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You’re making one right now!,,,,,Phoebe,
 And-and you’re using my name!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Look, I’m talking right now! You’re—you mean her.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! (Yells into the apartment) And shame on all of you! You’re disgusting! Especially you (points to someone) with that! (Storms away.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were a lot of them.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Um-mmm, and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. (She notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is trying to remember where he’s seen her before.) (To him) You’re trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I’ll give you a hint. From p0rn! Okay? (He tries to rush his girlfriend out.) Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! (To Joey) See?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow!,,,,,Phoebe,
 No! Barry and Mindy.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Which time?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y’know that if I’d work with stocks, I’d have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh that’s so sweet! (Her cell phone rings.) Oh! Hang on! (Quickly grabs a cigarette and starts to light it as her phone rings.) Hang onnnnnn!!! (Gets the cigarette lighted and answers the phone.) (On phone.) Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it’s a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it’s okay. It’s okay, you’re allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! (Answering the phone.) Go!! Who’s this? (Listens) Oh okay, you’re gonna like working for me. What’s your name? (Listens) What kind of name is Brendy? I… Whatever… Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (yelling from Monica’s room) No-no!! No!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.",,,,,Phoebe,
" What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can’t call my office they’ll kill me! I can’t call my clients they’ll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (louder) My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can’t breathe.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Then yes that is what I’m having. (Takes another puff of the cigarette.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Most people don’t like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I’m already going crazy. I miss Joan.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Ross) So what’s going on with you?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Still going through that dry spell with Carol?,,,,,Phoebe,
 How long has it been since you had s*x?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh that’s not so bad.,,,,,Phoebe,
 That is.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Maybe you need to spice things up a little.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I don’t know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other…",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y’know, dirty talk, mange-a-tois, toys…",,,,,Phoebe,
 Roll playing… You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you’re-you’re-you’re rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody’s watching! (Ross looks at her.) It never happened.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No! It’s not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay! Okay! (Puts it out and comes out of the bathroom.) I’m so glad you’re here.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, give it to me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Give it!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank God.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I’ve got to get out of this bed, I’m going crazy here. Crazy!",,,,,Phoebe,
" What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!",,,,,Phoebe,
 What are you two girls whispering about over there?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here! (Points at Ross.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know! But if I didn’t work there, what else would I do?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change—ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I thought I’d try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I’ll be back soon.,,,,,Phoebe,
 No. I’ve learned my lesson.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Let’s go! Come on! Move it! (Grabs her coat.) Come on! (To an old man who’s holding her shoes and briefcase.) Shoes! Briefcase! (Takes them both.) Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder. (She leaves.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Surprise! Look who’s back!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh, I don’t think so!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Jack!! Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Nu-uh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay I didn’t get that message. So this doesn’t count—Anyway, I’ll be in my office.",,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s all right, I’ll work here. This is goo, next to this plant. (She picks a place in the lobby next to a plant.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" You’re in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake…",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, so this is all about money! Y’know it’s bad enough that—Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m having another heart attack!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Arthur, he’s the guy calling 9-1-1) Dumbass!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, they fired me and I’m having heart attack.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (singing),,,,,Phoebe,
" Or, y’know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you’ve got y’know a little of this (she sticks her chest out and shakes it) goin’ on. Wow! I still have it!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Now, we can kick anybody’s ass!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (deadpan) Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?,,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, Joey, that’s actually a really good idea!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You guys!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What is that?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! (She takes out a sock that’s been made into a bunny with eyes, nose, mouth, whiskers, and two other socks sown onto it for ears.) Oh for crying out loud!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Now, it’s you little bunny friend. (She sticks it in Rachel’s face and they both laugh.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ross!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, you’re a freak!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Pat Sajak?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Alex Trebek?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Chuck Woolery?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Say we are unagi!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (stopping her) No Rachel! They got here first!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why is Ross doing that?,,,,,Phoebe,
 We should help him!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What’s a Movement class?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! How bad was it?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Coming through! (Has to dodge a fireman) Oh! Coming through! (Sees a cute one.) Oh! Hello! Hi! (Smiles then realizes) No! Right! Coming through!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me! It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess (To Rachel) you should get to stay here.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What’s that smell?,,,,,Phoebe,
 So did you sleep well last night?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Y’know what Joey left on my pillow?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Gum!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t use a curling iron.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thanks Monica!,,,,,Phoebe,
" What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I can smell it a little, bake the pie.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! (Takes the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah this is Phoebe. (Listens) Really?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato chips.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. (Reaches for one.),,,,,Phoebe,
" (gritting her teeth) Okay, I’ll be out in a second.",,,,,Phoebe,
 That doesn’t lock does it?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey! Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (To Rachel) Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see, I didn’t, I didn’t tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s just face it, that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay at Joey’s.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah she said something about crumbies.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (To Rachel) Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!",,,,,Phoebe,
 No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!,,,,,Phoebe,
 All right fine! This looks like so much fun. (Examining the bowl of wet paper towels.),,,,,Phoebe,
" God, what a mess. (She grabs the bowl and heads for Monica’s.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y’know, this is probably none of my business, but weren’t you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, sly.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (interrupting) Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh that’s good, I guess she’ll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.",,,,,Phoebe,
 ‘Cause that’s just your taste.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
" My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these (She squeezes the skin on her chin together to form…)",,,,,Phoebe,
 A chin dimple!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Have you seen your guy’s body?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He’s a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, like there are police for that!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know. (Laughs.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, Chandler funny?",,,,,Phoebe,
 My guy is well read.,,,,,Phoebe,
 My guy has great teeth!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What did you do on yours?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Rachel, what the hell is this?!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No reason, it’s just I know a single guy that cares about other people.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, so do a lot of people.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? ""Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?"" (Imitates him.) ""Uhh, okay—I gotta go!""",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y’know you might even end up with someone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay sure!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ross, you can’t tell her not to go. You just started dating.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.",,,,,Phoebe,
 This is Patrick. (Points to him.),,,,,Phoebe,
" (looks) Oh my God, you’re right! I am too late; they’re sitting on the couch and talking! (To Patrick) Come on! (They go over to the couch.) Rachel?",,,,,Phoebe,
 This is Patrick.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what’s underneath it.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! Okay! Yeah, that’s okay. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (Sits Patrick down next to Rachel.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, okay, let’s talk it out.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Then why did she ask us to…,,,,,Phoebe,
" Rachel, we’re sorry for pushing those guys on you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, look! That’s Elizabeth!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You’ve got to get out of here! Save yourself!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Don’t worry about me, I’m a robot! I’m just a machine!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (she stops reading from the script) Oh my God.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I am extremely talented!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (interrupting) No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, you’re solid. Yeah, you’re just no me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (tremendously overacting) Fine! I’ll do it without you! (Joey gives her thumbs up) I don’t need you or anybody else! I’m gonna make it on my own! (Joey closes the door to his bedroom.) You’ll see!! You’ll all see!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I am.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (overacting with a song this time) (singing) Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
"  Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until... (The flashback shows Paulo lying face down on the massage table and slowly moving his hands up Phoebe's legs and grabbing her butt.)",,,,,Phoebe,
  And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (The flashback shows Paulo rolling over and showing Phoebe his equipment.),,,,,Phoebe,
"  Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!",,,,,Phoebe,
  It's not that bad.,,,,,Phoebe,
"  Chandler, Chandler.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh!  All right.  Now, let's not do this!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!,,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know!  I know!  I know!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.",,,,,Phoebe,
" There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (overacting badly) I can’t! My circuits are fried! They’re fried I tell you!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, ""Ooh, where’d Ross go?""",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Ross) He’s holding us back.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No! Joey, you’re going to be great!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (in a sexy voice to Chandler) I’ll be waiting.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I’m just deciding which one to use—I’m gonna start writing another book!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I want to see what he wants first.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You’re Elizabeth’s father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. Not looking for dates. (Monica turns in horror.),,,,,Phoebe,
" (writing frantically) You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a little slower?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, it’s about relationships. Y’know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!",,,,,Phoebe,
 And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. (Chandler and Monica kiss.) And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, why don’t you just get him fired?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (writing in her book) ""You wish.""",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m not writing about you! I’m writing about other people.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Marcia and Chester.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I see what you’re doing!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (Turning around in the chair) Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I know what time you said.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it’s my book to the rescue, huh? (Reading her book) Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thanks! So are you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (reading from her book) Mon… (Pause as she restarts) Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they’re supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it’s at seven.",,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s right.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (writing in her book) Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (dejected) Hi, you guys.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Well it’s just—it’s one of those situations that I just hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.,,,,,Phoebe,
 No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay that’s so generous!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Great! Okay then it’s just us girls!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (gasps) Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. (Giggles) Yeah I know; we’d be great together!",,,,,Phoebe,
" So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, and then lunch.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s gay?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else, y’know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. (Rachel agrees.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Me too!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I don’t know, I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Don’t even get me started on yours!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
 No! Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!",,,,,Phoebe,
 What are you gonna do?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Rachel said that!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! Here it is! (Noticing it next to the door.) Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, ""Son of a bitch?"" (Son of a bitch is written across the entire picture.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, maybe ask this guy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, what did he do?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Joey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, we should go.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering from her room) Hey, did she buy it?",,,,,Phoebe,
 So did Heldi show you the place?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Now, have you told anyone else?",,,,,Phoebe,
 You told me.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, coffeehouse.",,,,,Phoebe,
 So how are things going with Paul?,,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.,,,,,Phoebe,
 No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Rachel) Watch this.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi Paul!,,,,,Phoebe,
 So how are things going with you?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! That was so weird, huh?",,,,,Phoebe,
 I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s… He’s mad at you!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Please, I think you know why.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well then I think that’s it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, if that’s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know? Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (coming over after returning the musket) Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Or not, whatever.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Chandler, I-I will handle this! (To the jeweler) How much is it?",,,,,Phoebe,
 We will give you $10.,,,,,Phoebe,
 We stand firm at $10.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. (To the jeweler) Listen, I’m sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’ll give you $1 for them.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay umm, I’d also like to try on the tiara. (The male jeweler hands it to her.) Oh yeah. Okay. (Puts it on.) (To the jeweler) What do you think, too much?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (He hands it to her and Phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) Something’s missing. It’s not… Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God!! (She runs after him, but sets of the security system, which locks the store’s door and brings down a set of bars behind her, caging her in.) No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! (Points the musket at them.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Chandler, I found the perfect ring. (Holding it out for her.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they (points to the jeweler) put me in jail!,,,,,Phoebe,
 The little jail between the doors!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Maybe it was the guy.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering from her room) Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring.,,,,,Phoebe,
 There he is! (Points.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow! You’re good! After this, we should solve crimes.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.",,,,,Phoebe,
 It is your office.,,,,,Phoebe,
 John?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Chandler) Here he is.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! I would trade.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
" If she says no, can I have the ring?",,,,,Phoebe,
 If!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (with her mouthful) Hi Monica.,,,,,Phoebe,
 It’s gone.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Chandler) We’re practically kissing. (Makes a kissy face and winks at him.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Open bar?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I can do that for the kids.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Y’know, you are 12 years older than her.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! Oop! (Hands him back the ring.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Here.,,,,,Phoebe,
 So now what’s going on here?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I know what a silent is I meant, what’s going on with your hair?",,,,,Phoebe,
 No! It’s nice!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, hi. (They shake hands.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey you guys! Look!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I got me some drinks!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Open bar!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You just can’t stand anyone else enjoying themselves can’t you?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applauding again. Joey waves and does a salute.],,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, just buy the damn boat! (She’s still working her way through her tray of booze.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m just helping the kids!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
" It’s a trip for two! (She gets up and takes off her blouse-type thingy she’s wearing over her dress.) Excuse me. (She walks over to table four.) Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, enchantée. (She holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he only shakes it.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! (Chandler is frantically trying to wave them off.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 I wanna see what’s in your hand. I wanna see the trash.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Eww! Oh, it’s all dirty. You should throw this out.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What happened?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor…",,,,,Phoebe,
 Good one! Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment! Convince her that you’re a little coward!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, you’re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, they’re gonna be so happy together.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Not that often!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Me too! So happy for them!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Totally. I’m like 90/10.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Definitely!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What do you mean?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You mean a backup?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, yeah I got that.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hm-mmm.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Joey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I locked him years ago!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were… (She makes two clicking sounds with her tongue and purrs.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well hey, it’s just a backup.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I’ve already lost Chandler!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t—Look I don’t know what you’re complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married!",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right well let’s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat—This is hard!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No wait! Just—Okay—Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don’t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Rachel) I’m talking about massages.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Good!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Left! (Rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfold and read them.) Thank you.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (reading) Ross!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah absolutely! (They both switch.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn’t here!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, let her stay out there. It’s sweet.",,,,,Phoebe,
" So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y’know, I’m kinda musical.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh honey no, you ate it all.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. (Singing)",,,,,Phoebe,
" If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Really?! Oh that’s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. (She goes to get ready.),,,,,Phoebe,
" You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?",,,,,Phoebe,
" What a great night, Chandler can’t do it, these guys kissed… (Points to Ross and Rachel.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well yeah, that and Chandler’s problem.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we’ll get us some Mai Thai’s, (To Chandler) maybe no more for you though.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (she’s strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I think I’ll play it at the wedding.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Would she?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I’m just gonna need a small deposit.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y’know, I don’t really need their permission.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you… You gotta do something about your eyes.",,,,,Phoebe,
 They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Maybe just 10 minutes for you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (singing, angrily)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (singing),,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh thank you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Now… (Starts singing again) ""Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer—(Chandler enters and grabs her guitar and closes the door behind him)—Oh—oh! All right, I’ll pound on him in the morning.",,,,,Phoebe,
 It starts?,,,,,Phoebe,
" That is so smart! (To Chandler, under her breath) Break it off. Break it off now.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! Ross!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica and Chandler.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Nothing—Why?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (to the students) Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh Ross, hi.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m sorry, I’m with a client right now.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, let’s talk outside.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (pause as she considers it) Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (gasps) My God! What did you order?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Look, why don’t you just pay for it yourself?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr. Chandler.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.",,,,,Phoebe,
 He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it’s my fault?! You didn’t have to massage him! You could’ve sent him away! You could’ve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!",,,,,Phoebe,
 So what do you guys want for an engagement present?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Break my heart—Oh, all right.",,,,,Phoebe,
" If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Your own boat?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because I’m normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie in a plastic baggie.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why not?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You do?,,,,,Phoebe,
 That and arrogance.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I can’t believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out to Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on, it’s not that big a deal!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are there any more from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work off of those.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah—No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for sure.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th, 2032.",,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s what you think.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Nesele Toulouse.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.) Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down) you’re burning in hell!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t know. I don’t know. I can’t lie to him again. Oh no I—no! I’m just gonna press my breasts up against him.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-huh, yeah that’s right.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What? You mean behind my back?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (gasps) Oh God!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Let’s see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh… But no! No! You can’t-you can’t hire him, because that—it’s not professional. Umm, this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey—Ooh, how’s Hilda? Is she working out?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Sorry.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What happened?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You! An actor?! That’s madness!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You must be Hilda.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.",,,,,Phoebe,
 So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?,,,,,Phoebe,
 But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh Willie’s still alive!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! That’s the creep that you’re with at the Statue of Liberty.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, why don’t you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (returning) Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!",,,,,Phoebe,
 He is! But he’s getting divorced—Ross! Maybe you know him.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You don’t have to be back for a half-hour!,,,,,Phoebe,
 So you wouldn’t mind if he was dating someone else?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m having a really good time!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh. No that’s okay, he’s a friend.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I… Well y’know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I’d just be lost.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, don’t freak out. I’ll go.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I know. Hold on. (She walks over to the couch.) Hey Ross?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, umm that’s Whitney (Points), Kyle’s ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y’know divert her so that we can slip out?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. (She holds up the tickets that Kyle gave her.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi Ginger.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t have it!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ugh, okay Sherlock! (Hands over the key.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though, for diverting Kyle’s ex.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (To Ross) Kyle’s ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her, not date her!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Watching ballroom dancing?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Like she’s really mean, and she’s over critical, and-and—No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!",,,,,Phoebe,
 And! She uses s*x as a weapon!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You’re still gonna go out with her?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, didn’t you just hear what I said?!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (interrupting him) No listen to me! She is crazy!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You see? Nothing is good enough for her!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah well, maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You think he’s emotionally unavailable?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, maybe he wouldn’t be if she didn’t bring the office home every night!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year’s Eve 1997.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (gets up and starts to leave) We want the last six years back!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I’m sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how’s Whitney?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh he knows! (Quietly) For the most part.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Both of you together?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh right, because you’re so capable of change.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, and y’know what? I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh. Y’know, he hums while he does other stuff to.",,,,,Phoebe,
" And y’know, even if they break up again, you’d better not let him in your sad men’s club!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Potato, Potaato. (She’s pronounces potato with the both the short and long As.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, let’s see it!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You guys make a very attractive couple. (The camera cuts to a shot of the picture and we see that Monica is posing with Joey instead of Chandler.),,,,,Phoebe,
 I hope it’s you.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes!!! Oh!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Still.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wh-why is that the best part?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Aww, and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey Rachel?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-hmm.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! Well, if that’s what you want…",,,,,Phoebe,
 But why does it even matter?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (gasps) You wouldn’t! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve done it at least twice!",,,,,Phoebe,
" And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. (Rachel stops talking.) Oh I guess that was it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, thank you so much! (They hug.) Okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh I know.,,,,,Phoebe,
 See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Na-uh, I am!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Because I cared enough to lie!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What are you talking about?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (To Rachel) Well, it’s better than us deciding.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No! Coins hate me!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ugh, what a kiss ass.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes! Your honor?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey! Do you want, do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this today with Rachel while we were showering together, naked. (Raises her glass and drinks.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?! I won!,,,,,Phoebe,
 The coins have finally forgiven me!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (running after her) Rach, it’s gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey) You guys are the best!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. (Rachel looks at her.) Oh, you mean today.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh that’s so sweet thanks.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 This stuff is great!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s maid of honor.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Because I think it means more to you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" It's fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking about since you were what, 14? (She’s referring to the Halloween picture.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (looking at the picture again) Man alive!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay!,,,,,Phoebe,
 And call me!,,,,,Phoebe,
 We want you to marry her!,,,,,Phoebe,
 She is so amazing! You have no idea.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey, she’s so cool. She speaks four languages.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but you always say that.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Whatever.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Secret affair!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering with Erin) Oh. Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh no.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yay!! Oh so, you’re not, you’re not mad at us anymore?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Didn’t you sleep together?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Then change it back!,,,,,Phoebe,
 No spark? Didn’t you sleep together?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Does Joey have any idea?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, you mean like that you’re kind of a loner.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, and maybe that you’re a real (She says something in Italian, and it doesn’t matter what she said. It’s not important so I don’t need everyone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh well, I guess Italian isn’t one of the four languages you speak.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, just a regular old flying dwarf.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" So how was, how was your date?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey Joey, y’know what? You are way too good for her.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already have that. (She gets up and heads for her room)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it's not!",,,,,Phoebe,
 It's just my knitting that's all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebe's bag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?,,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry, who's this?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, there's no dog here?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.),,,,,Phoebe,
 (Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) They're here already? How are they doing this?,,,,,Phoebe,
 There's no dog in here.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She bends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?",,,,,Phoebe,
" That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you crazy?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You don't like ice cream?,,,,,Phoebe,
 All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. We'll be back in a minute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I'd say about a month.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (doing Clunkers) Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
" You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Where's Chandler?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wash your hands!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (interrupts him) No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.",,,,,Phoebe,
" See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into her room)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey, is Chandler here?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look who's back!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.",,,,,Phoebe,
" We have good news, look who's back!",,,,,Phoebe,
 It's a Thanksgiving miracle!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in…(Realizes, that Chandler starts to not believe her) I went too far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?",,,,,Phoebe,
" His first big kid’s bike, this is so exciting!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I never had a bike of my own.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. (They’re all speechless) So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Not really, I got to drag him around too! (They all nod, ""Oh."")",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, and they’ve been coming by all day. They love it!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (gasps) Oh my God Ross!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I love it!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I’ve ever gotten.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (starts to leave, but stops) Oh and Chandler’s about to cry.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, uh-huh so much!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Of course!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. (The gang is giggles then as Phoebe gets the bike out of the rack, gets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.) See?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (hopping off the bike) Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat—or a beanbag chair!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why? Why do I have to learn?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What kind of an emergency?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You won’t let go?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Swear?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (thinks it over) Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 All right.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well…,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. (Does so.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Weee!!! (Ross pushes her and lets go.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I am shocked! Shocked!! (She storms off leaving Ross to defend himself from the angry looks from onlookers.),,,,,Phoebe,
" (seeing him) Oh, hello liar.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I could’ve been killed I hope you know!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. (Ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something that suspiciously looks like a bike.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?! (Ross rings the bell.) What the hell?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?! Why?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (sarcastically) Okay Ross! (Ross exits and she says quietly to the bike) Please don’t die!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I can’t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I’d be able to do that! Thank you Ross.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Don’t be so corny Ross, it’s not an after-school special. (She rides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmly attached.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering carrying a skull) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Haaaa... (Puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Huh?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it. (She grabs the skull, pulls out a stick of licorice, and takes a bite.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering) Oh, hey, you guys!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, why not?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why do you think she's having so much fun living with Joey?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Really? So she said, she didn’t wanna live with me anymore?",,,,,Phoebe,
 You're sure? You're absolutely sure?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. (Chandler and Monica look surprised) Kind of what ‘probably’ really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" y’know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!"" Y’know? You gotta take care of yourselves! (She starts to walk out) In this world history teaches us nothing! (Exits)",,,,,Phoebe,
" So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!",,,,,Phoebe,
 That's fun. (She exits disappointedly.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! (she sits down next to him),,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Maybe on some level.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) Hey, Joey, I got you another present. (She puts it on the counter)",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's a…tarantula! (Joey almost falls down from his drum-stool jumping up) Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (sarcastic) Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. (She turns around, about to leave)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Our apartment is ready.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Because you would rather live here with Joey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hm?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (nods along) Fish!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here…",,,,,Phoebe,
" We did have fun, didn't we?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yay, okay!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh! New sconces!",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no! (She runs to see.) (Running back, excitedly) Oh! Wow!!!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up.",,,,,Phoebe,
 There’s a skylight?! (Runs to see and yells from the bedroom.) Wow!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (returning slowly) Y’know I’m-I’m sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" A little bit, yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You heard her too?! You have the gift!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you sure?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh me too.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I do not hear that.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Absolutely!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. (Joey exits.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Duly noted.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I’ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note. (Hands it to Rachel.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! Here’s Joseph Francis!,,,,,Phoebe,
 So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I don’t accept this rule. When we make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better! Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this (Motions that their friendship) is for life!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it does.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, you wore me down.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (gasps) (whispering) Oh my God! That’s David!,,,,,Phoebe,
" David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you say someone’s name enough, they turn around.",,,,,Phoebe,
 David! (He kisses her cheek) What-what are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be in Russia?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well… Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, of course I would want to see you. I…I think about you all the time.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (excited) Yes! Oh no!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I can’t. I can’t believe I have plans, I can’t. Can you do it tomorrow night though?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh. (They go over and talk.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No he won’t. And that’s not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y’know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don’t have my principles, I don’t have anything!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water’s fine.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh Joey, we’ve heard the specials three times! Okay? There’s prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli. (She grabs his menu and hands it to the waiter.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Huh?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (checking her watch) Yeah, I’m very wise. I know.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" God Joey, this is taking forever!",,,,,Phoebe,
 W-w—I just—it’s that—I have—y’know I have-I have an appointment. And it’s very important.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well… It’s a date.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this.",,,,,Phoebe,
" That—It’s not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he’s very special to me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 She was?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, whatever. Y’know what? I don’t have time to convince you because he’s only here for four hours, and I’m gonna go see him! (Gets up and leaves.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! (She exits.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I wouldn’t miss this.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you’re such a gentleman. (Grabs his arm.) Come on! We’re going to my place! (Drags him off to her place.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in like…,,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s really beautiful. What does it mean?,,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I do too. (They kiss.),,,,,Phoebe,
" (seeing him) Okay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No I’m not okay. The only guy I’ve ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never…I may never see him again. (Crying.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh right, like they’re gonna let me have a passport.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well—But—Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y’know before he does, then he can come back. (They hug again.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (looking up) There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn’t Mother Nature amazing?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that’s pretty amazing too.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! I won’t say, ‘no’ to a movie!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Shh! Get me out of here.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (crossing her fingers and closing her eyes) Please don’t be a space ship. Please don’t be a space ship. (She turns on the light and looks around and finds that it’s the smoke detector that’s beeping.) Oh thank God! (She moves a chair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off, in frustration she yanks the thing off of the wall. She sets it down and heads for bed, just as she gets there it beeps again. She opens the cover and removes the battery, but it still beeps.) How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can…",,,,,Phoebe,
 Don’t interrupt me!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. (She points at each as she says it.) Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do… (She picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. She then gets up and heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping has stopped.) Well done, Pheebs. (She resumes her trek to bed, but is stopped at the entrance to the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smoke detector.) (Yelling.) What do you want from me?!!!!!!!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, this is where you and I part ways. (She drops the blanket into the chute.) Noisy bitch!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! How did you get back here?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (scared) Fire alarm? (She opens the door to reveal a fireman holding the blanket with the smoke detector.) Oh! Hi, officer—fireman, can-can I help you?",,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s not mine.,,,,,Phoebe,
 How do you know?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Fine! (She takes the blanket.) But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!,,,,,Phoebe,
" There’s a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! (He exits and she goes to shut it off.) There’s a reset button! My God! Why didn’t I see that! (She takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.) Oh! (She presses it hard, but of course it would help if the button was still attached to the detector. In frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) Ohh, God!",,,,,Phoebe,
 What? What happened to the window in the attic?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the window in the attic!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ugh, I hate this year!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well okay, it’s already February and I’ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh that’s right!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y’know, I probably wouldn’t have to say spank as much. (Monica and Ross are shocked.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, like you never called!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh okay. Umm, all right. (Picks up the phone and starts reading from the script.) Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh okay, well I’m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. (Hangs up the phone.) Yeah you’re right, this is easy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh well, all right…um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No. (Pause) Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (on phone) Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? (Listens) Earl, thanks. (Listens) Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I’d like to talk to you about your toner needs. (She’s reading from the script.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m hearing what you’re saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.",,,,,Phoebe,
 May I ask why?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I surely do!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (doesn’t have any luck) Umm, is-is that because you’re out of toner?",,,,,Phoebe,
 No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Chandler?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Earl, you’re not hearing me! All I’m saying is that you’re not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with! (One of her coworkers overhears that, and she mimes that she didn’t mean him.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right so Earl, let’s just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh sorry, boyfriend!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, whatever! Anything!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, he’s gotta go.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No! I’m not finished yet! Don’t! Don’t you dare hang up on me!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (to Marge) Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He’s the supply manager around here.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (goes over to his desk) Earl! I’m Phoebe.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, look it, you-you can’t kill yourself.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No-no I can’t! I can’t let you do it!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Because it was fate that made me call you today!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No! Think about it okay? This isn’t even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you’re my first call! And-and somebody else might’ve hung up on you, but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see that this-this…this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, it’s fate!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh. Well umm, okay here’s a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Sure! (Thinks.) Umm, where are you from?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I’ve got-I’ve got goose bumps. (She holds out her arm.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm.",,,,,Phoebe,
" But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y’know, I don’t-I don’t think it’s you. This is a freaky place. (To All) Hey! Guys! (Everyone looks up.) (To Earl) Oh no, it’s you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but you shouldn’t compare yourself to me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That’s it!! That’s everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! (They all cheer again.) And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean. (Rachel and Monica look intrigued and as they all head into Central Perk, Rachel picks up the hippity-hop that Phoebe left behind.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, well get in line missy. (To Ross) So, can I have a ride stud?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (getting out) Okay, who’s next?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?! ‘Cause y’know that hurts.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Least of all you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (running up) Okay. Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. Okay, I’m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. (She opens her coat and reveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as Ross jumps in behind the wheel. She inserts the device, unlocks the door, opens it, and the alarm goes off.) Haul ass!!!! (Runs off.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! (Hands her the hippity-hop.) It’s for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Because it’s our thirtieth birthday.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wait! (Knocks on the door and Ursula opens it.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Nu-uh!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You have your birth certificate?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Our mom.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Do you have my birth certificate?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (reading the certificate) Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I just lost a whole year of my life.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Your middle name is Pamela?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?",,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s my first name.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, what’s going on?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yay! I love drunk Monica!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what we’ll do, I’ll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one will even notice her.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.",,,,,Phoebe,
" If you could do that, I’d marry the hippity-hop.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (clinking two glasses together) Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from the birthday girl! Huh?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (screaming) Wooo!! Hoo!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (To Joey) Okay quick, help me get this off! (Motions to her top.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Like okay I-I-I, I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I, I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks. (Gets up and exits.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! (Phoebe walks away smiling.),,,,,Phoebe,
 You did the right thing.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (Clears Throat) Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah? Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. (Pointing to an attractive man sitting at a table behind them.),,,,,Phoebe,
 (A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh knockers will help us figure it out. (She walks by and he checks her out.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, he left his cell phone.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah… That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. (They both get up.),,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.,,,,,Phoebe,
" That wasn’t a date! That was, that was just friends getting together…(quietly) having s*x.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Nice try.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t know.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ah-ha! Too cocky!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (handing Rachel the phone) Fine all right, but I’d bet you’d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that’s one for you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. Who has Barney’s the store on their speed dial?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Good.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, now you lost me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No I didn’t!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. (Rachel dials her phone and Phoebe’s bag starts to ring.) Oh, it does work! (Rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of Phoebe’s handbag.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 That is a different phone.,,,,,Phoebe,
 That is damning evidence.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yes, I’m the one who found your phone.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (To Rachel) Shhh! I’m on a call! (On phone) Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It’s umm, it’s umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y’know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. (Listens) Okay, well okay I’ll see you then. (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just…be alone y’know to think about my mom and her suicide.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?! That’s the first time today!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Because it’s my apartment!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all the calls to China.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Could you-could you umm, give us one second?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wh-what do we do?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Can you believe this? (Rachel exhales in amazement.) We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hmm, they just don’t make ‘em like that anymore!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Rachel, listen—I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! You’re such a great friend!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh that’d be me. Sir. (Hands him the cell phone.) After you.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (whispering) Nice!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (returning with Joey) With what?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oo! You should have one of us do it!,,,,,Phoebe,
 No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes! A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?! No! It was my idea!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, you’ve got to stop chattering!",,,,,Phoebe,
 What is it?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, I don’t believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. (She’s pinching the bit of skin between her right thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks. (Takes the pills.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 It’s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I love you Hexadrin! (She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with a story! (She pulls out the instructions and side effects paper.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Say what?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God! (Starts reading them.) Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache—Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don’t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I’m sorry, extra strength death capsules!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, then I must be disoriented.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I feel like my face is swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one! (Holds up the warning label.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side effects!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, it’s totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Joey) What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I know! Robin is so gay!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two (Points to Monica and Joey) actually had hooked up.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (still reading the label) Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! (Checks her watch) That’s it! I’m out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it’s like a huge weight has been lifted! ‘Cause look, (reads the side effects) no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I’m just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria—Oh.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Since when are you into swing music?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What is your job?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (wearing a veil) Am I crazy or does this totally go?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (To Rachel) Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, is that spelled with a ‘C’ or a ‘K’? Oh my God! It doesn’t matter; they’re both great!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Got it.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (coming back out) Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (hearing the signal) I’m coming! I’m coming! (She takes off towards the signal and almost knocks another woman over.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay! (Runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) Hey! (Heads the other way and hears another blast.) What do I do?!! (She runs in the second direction and finds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. She moves the dresses out of the way to find Rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) What are you doing? (Rachel doesn’t stop.) Did you find the dress? (Rachel won’t stop so Phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Did you find the dress?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I—We gotta get Monica. (She starts to leave.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!! (She grabs Rachel’s hand and drags her towards Monica.) Excuse me! Excuse me! (She’s knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.),,,,,Phoebe,
 I know. Hand me a tissue. (Monica hands her one.),,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (gasps) Does that mean Carcass is available?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, swing music is so out.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—They just stop living.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God! (Joey looks at her.) I’m sorry, too soon. You go.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Good for you!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Go for it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I did, but that was really fun.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, great! We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know, he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck. (Does that to Monica.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (laughs) All I could think of was y’know, ""Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?""",,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself. (She starts to open up her blouse.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You sound like a guy.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You’ll have a last kiss.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay bye. (They kiss.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Bye! (Phoebe goes over and joins Monica on the couch.) We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (yelling back) I miss you too!!!! (He walks away.),,,,,Phoebe,
 No. Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, don’t sweat it. (Looking around her.) Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy’s cute. (Points to a guy sitting behind Monica.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 No that is the last thing you want to do!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Because you’re marrying him!,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.",,,,,Phoebe,
" That is correct! Yes, you’re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! You’re right! Go! (Monica starts to leave.) Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it’s too late! Wait no! (Monica stops.) Does this also mean putting out doesn’t get you love? (Monica is shocked.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Rach?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh. (Picks it up.) It’s just so unexpected! I…I uh…Boy I’ll tell you it’s just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y’know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in…,,,,,Phoebe,
 …in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. (To an imaginary Neil Simon) Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words. (Blows him a kiss.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Please, don’t play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT’S SATURDAY NIGHT!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Joey) Oh hey! How was your audition?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What are you doing?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! You got it?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 The next next?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What’s the matter?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Grandma’s gonna have to get in line.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, when can we have this shower?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We’re done!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Rachel, calm down!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (grabs and shakes Rachel) Just calm down woman!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh, here. What time?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Finger sandwiches and tea.,,,,,Phoebe,
 And chili!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Both!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Neither.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Lusts of the flesh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t know. (Timidly) A cowboy theme?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay but look! Look at what I got! It’s her address book! (Holds it up.) We have a guest list!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. (Holds up $40.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" How are you? (The woman nods) Good. (She goes over to another couple of women.) Hi, thanks for coming.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Thank you. (To the other woman) No? (She nods.) All right. (She goes to another pairing.) Oh, it’s so nice to see you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. (Goes over to Rachel.) Hey Rach?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Who the hell are all these people?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that: Losers!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You were supposed to tell her!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Fine, I’ll go call her.",,,,,Phoebe,
 And then for forgetting to invite you to it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.",,,,,Phoebe,
 We ruined everything.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Sur-surprise.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! No problem! I… (Cassie emerges from the bathroom and we once again visit slow motion Barry White background music land with the sexy hair-flipping thing going on, only this time Phoebe is entranced. For more information on Denise Richards you can visit your local library or look her up on the Internet at her official website at www.deniserichards.com.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (in her head) Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She’s not your cousin!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joey’s like in Checkers.) Chess!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What is this? What’s going on?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Joey’s!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (laughs) Yeah, I’m sure that happened.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay! I just—I didn’t know that you are a lesbian. (Joey smiles and nods lewdly.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you’re so—y’know so…vanilla.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 To Ross.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay! All right! Yeah! ‘Cause I just can’t picture it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! Y’know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, somewhere Joey’s head is exploding.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Rachel, it’s okay. You don’t have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I’ve had better.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. (Points.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about, y’know, all the things that he’s taught you. Like… (They all try to think about one example and don’t succeed.) Or all the things you taught him.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well let’s just say its.. she’s lucky she has a sweet ass, ‘cause she’s not so good at the writing.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know, nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, you’re right. How’s the Mrs.?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 YOU KNOW?!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and Rachel.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, so now they know that you know, and they don't know that Rachel knows?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own",,,,,Phoebe,
 Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.),,,,,Phoebe,
" I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!",,,,,Phoebe,
 No!,,,,,Phoebe,
" God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey, you can't say anything!",,,,,Phoebe,
 He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Here it comes. Our first kiss.,,,,,Phoebe,
 And why not?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You're-you're what?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gotta change things.",,,,,Phoebe,
" How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (To Monica) Oh, that’s beautiful.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I’ve never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding. (Rachel glares at her.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. (Gets up and leaves.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey sweetie!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica’s. I’ll be right back. (She goes to get it.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 What? (He leans in to kiss her.) Oh. (They kiss and Phoebe pauses.) Ooh. (Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I know. They were mine.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m wearing his briefs right now.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.,,,,,Phoebe,
 And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.,,,,,Phoebe,
 There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever do that.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, whatever.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s great Joe!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hmm?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I think it’s important that you do.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Feel better?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I understand.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why?! What’s happening to the coffee house?! (Monica looks at her.) Oh! (Realizes.),,,,,Phoebe,
 What are they?,,,,,Phoebe,
 That play?,,,,,Phoebe,
 The movie?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah! Back then y’know, we called it the Great War. It really was!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Congratulations!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Go ahead.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes! Very good.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ross, please! My make-up! (He walks away angrily.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (walking up) What’s up? (Rachel hands her the note and she reads it.) Tell Monica I’m sorry. (Pause) Tell her yourself!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! Chandler just left though!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he’s changed his name, y’know? Tell Monica I’m sorry.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Don’t be so negative! Good God! Isn’t it possible that Sorry is sitting in there (Joey and Rachel’s apartment) right now?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (pointing at Ross) Okay but if you don’t find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh man.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. Well there’s one down.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Y’know she might not even notice he’s gone.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can’t do this here! (She drags her into the bathroom.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but you’ve got to pull yourself together! Monica can’t see you like this! Then she’ll know something’s wrong!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. (Looks.) Oh, that’s gone too. This is Monica’s bathroom right?!",,,,,Phoebe,
 No-no! I-I…I found one.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (looking into the trash can) Sure. (Reaching into the trash can.) Do you need some floss? (Grabs a piece of it.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh here’s a whole bunch.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (finding something interesting in the trash can) Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
" There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it’s positive. Monica’s pregnant. (Rachel covers her mouth.) So I guess she won’t be totally alone.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know! Monica’s gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I’m still holding this. (She throws the test back into the trash.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Right.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You told them he was missing?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. I’m going with you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ross, you’re tired. You’ve been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Wait, do you know how you’re going to stall her?",,,,,Phoebe,
 All right. Good luck.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! Is that him? (She points at someone.),,,,,Phoebe,
" He could be in disguise, y’know.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What the hell are you doing?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why not?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" But look Chandler, right now no-one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering) Found the vest! I mean we’re gonna have to keep an eye on it, y’know make sure we don’t lose it again…",,,,,Phoebe,
 So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God Monica!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (To Rachel) Wait! Maybe, maybe you’re overreacting! You do that y’know.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because they frown on that.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What’s going on?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! Oh!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You know?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What? You’ll hi-ya?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well you obviously didn’t see Chucky 3.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh and they’re gonna have a baby.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. (Phoebe and Rachel join Monica and Chandler on the altar.) Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren’t pregnant?",,,,,Phoebe,
" We found your test in the trash, if you’re not pregnant—(She sees Rachel shaking her head)—It’s because I am.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, I…I am with child. (Flash) And I didn’t want to say anything because it’s your day; I didn’t want to steal your thunder.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I can’t say.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I can’t say because he’s famous.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, okay. It’s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?! Well he never said that to me!,,,,,Phoebe,
 How about just the bridemaids?,,,,,Phoebe,
 It is.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
 So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Sneaky.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-hmm.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he’s gay.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (intrigued) Really?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, are you ready to talk about it?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Now?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, we’ll talk about something else then.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Who’s the father?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. That’s fine. That’s fair. Is it Tag?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll stop.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Is it Ross? It’s Ross isn’t it—Oh my God, it’s Joey!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ah-hah! At least we know it’s a him.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin…",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, ""James, James Brolin, are you sure?"" James Brolin said…",,,,,Phoebe,
 (shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant.,,,,,Phoebe,
" When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m-I’m just saying, don’t freak out until you’re a hundred percent sure.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’ll run out and get you one.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, she won’t tell us.",,,,,Phoebe,
 See? This is why you register.,,,,,Phoebe,
 30 seconds.,,,,,Phoebe,
 It’s time.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, it’s negative.",,,,,Phoebe,
 It’s negative.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Here. (Gives Rachel a tissue.),,,,,Phoebe,
" No, it’s positive.",,,,,Phoebe,
" It’s-it’s not negative, it’s positive.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well yeah, I lied before.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Now you know how you really feel about it.,,,,,Phoebe,
 With who?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?,,,,,Phoebe,
 A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know, it’s probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. He hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?! I think he’s cute.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Believe me I’m trying.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Pretty big? It’s huge! God, this guy doesn’t have a clue! He’s just walking down the street thinking, ‘I had s*x with Rachel Green. I rock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s walking around thinking, ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh yeah. That’s me.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I’m gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebe hug.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. (She sits down like she’s pregnant.),,,,,Phoebe,
 David Lynn.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? (Gasps) Is it Gunther?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Thank God, ‘cause that hair on a baby…",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why not?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Bus?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well-well but it is huge.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You’re thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It’s like, it’s like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick and painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother of…See?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 All right. (She sits down like she’s pregnant again.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Hell yeah! I’ll marry you! (She grabs the ring and puts it on.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I can and I will! (Kisses him.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 It’s Joey! (Joey turns and looks at her and she mouths ‘I love you’ to him.),,,,,Phoebe,
 We don’t know.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Who? Who is it?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Was that story over?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (gasps) Oh my God! I know who the father is… (She walks into Monica and Chandler’s.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I may play the fool at times, but I’m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won’t quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Really? Are you sure?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, sorry. Yeah. (They go inside to confront the father.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or…poison? No? Just for me? Okay. (Walks away.),,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 No!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I can’t say that didn’t hurt. But I’ll take you back Joey Tribbiani.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh! A Salami Buddy!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wait you stole those from these people’s wedding?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!,,,,,Phoebe,
" It was his sweater, but—Oh my God!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Me too! (Joins the hug.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, bye.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.",,,,,Phoebe,
 All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?! They took mine to give to you!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Maybe they don’t trust us.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica’s guest towels?,,,,,Phoebe,
 No you didn’t.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!",,,,,Phoebe,
 What stuff?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Did Rachel find you?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh she was looking for you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (deadpan) And?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh sorry. (Shocked) And?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Joey) Maybe it’s something you ate?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as they’re done with it at the key shining place.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well why don’t you use your key?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! We could have done that.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? ‘Cause y’know umm, they don’t-they don’t have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh no.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Didn’t you two already talk?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (simultaneously) Holy mother of God!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 That is brand new information!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 A little bit.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh Ross.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh hey hi, he’s doing it. He’s breaking down the door. (The chair breaks in half.) Okay, we’re in. (She hangs up the phone.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! So how was the doctor?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Good.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Come on in!,,,,,Phoebe,
 So how was the honeymoon?,,,,,Phoebe,
 That was the best part? (To Chandler) Good honeymooning tiger.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! (Angrily) Hi Greg, I’m Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You have got to be kidding me!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Monica! That’s not right! Start with where.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I can’t believe he taped the two of them having s*x!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (nasally) Greg and Jenny?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You got fake numbered.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Excuse me, I don’t want Greg and Jenny’s rejects.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!",,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.),,,,,Phoebe,
" No! Not the s*x part, just the stuff leading up to it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘Who came onto who,’ thing to rest! Come on now, think!!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You’re gonna get pregnant.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you came on to Ross!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Dinner was good!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m just saying hi! Now I’m gonna go!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (To him) Oh, well hello there.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Monica) I didn’t see this on the menu.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, so you're Monica’s boss?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! I sous stand.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh you…you made pesto?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Would you say your pesto is the best-o?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I made it myself.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it’s no pesto.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh Monica!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can’t wait to get sous-neath him.",,,,,Phoebe,
 But why?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.",,,,,Phoebe,
" But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?",,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Love it!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 But…,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Because I’m dumping him today.,,,,,Phoebe,
" He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time. (Mimicking him) ""So did-did you get home from work okay?"" ""Did-did you get out of the shower okay?""",,,,,Phoebe,
" Then he comes over! (Mimicking him) ""I’m so worried about you."" Uck! Be a man!",,,,,Phoebe,
" You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch!",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, that makes sense. (Starts towards the door.) Ugh. But—Screw you I’m going first! (She grabs her purse and runs out.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
" It will be…in a minute. Listen, Tim you’re a really great guy.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Aw. (Phoebe gets a bad taste in her mouth when he looks away) I’m just—I’m in a place in my life right now where I…I…,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Monica!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (simultaneously) I’m breaking up with you!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m, I’m breaking up with you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m sorry, I’m just—I’m…I’m just not ready for a relationship right now.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh that’s good, the chemistry thing for us too.",,,,,Phoebe,
" And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here. (Shakes his hand and leaves, which disgusts Monica.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh good! (And there’s general excitement.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Now wasn’t Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ursula! (Ursula turns, smiles, and continues walking.) Wait! Err-err, it’s me! Phoebe!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait a second! So, what’s new with you?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Huh. Okay. Well, I’m really happy for you. (Starts to walk away.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. Okay. Umm, y’know, my friends are having a Halloween party tonight at my old apartment so, you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy you’re marrying.",,,,,Phoebe,
" By the way, it’s a costume party.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (looks down) No. But thanks. (Walks away.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, it’s me. Phoebe!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Chandler) That is so you!,,,,,Phoebe,
 No wonder your pregnant.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ursula’s fiancée?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 My mother killed herself.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No-no! That’s okay, we’ll just start over. Okay? Hi! I’m Phoebe.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why are you looking at me like that?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. (Hands him a napkin.) So, what are you?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (laughs) No I-I meant your costume.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I love the second grade!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! It’s so much better than first grade when you don’t know what’s going on and definitely better than third grade. Y’know with all the politics and mind games.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, I’m a masseuse…by day. (Stands with her hands on her hips like a Supergirl pose.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 No I’m having fun. I’m really—And I’m really-really excited for you and Ursula.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (walking over) Hey. Ursula’s fiancée is really sweet! He’s a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Y’know normally y’know, I don’t like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 No I’m not! You are!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hello handsome. (Sees Ursula over her shoulder) Oh God. (Walks away in shame as they kiss.) Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Two weeks? That’s it?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh really?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Huh? (Ursula motions for Phoebe to keep quiet.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Peace Corps, really? (Ursula motions, ""I don’t know."")",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi liar!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Y’know the only reason he’s marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.,,,,,Phoebe,
 But they’re not!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why are you lying to him?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hmm?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm listen, I don’t think…I don’t think I’m gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay I can’t let you do this! She’s lying to you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. (She grabs Ursula’s purse and starts going through it and finds some papers.) Okay. Okay. Yeah—Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. (Holds up her nametag.) Okay, here’s the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here’s her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I almost don’t want to show this. (Hands it to him.) Just remember I’m a minute younger.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No. You’re not, you’re not stupid.",,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just…you did it with the wrong person. (He looks at her.) What?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, you should. (They shake hands.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (looking around) Who’s cell phone is that? It’s just so annoying; everywhere you go.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (checks) I never get calls!! (Answers the phone) Hello?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how’d you get this number?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! What an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh you did? (To Rachel) He did it! He did it!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Shhh! I’m talking.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you asking me out? ‘Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.,,,,,Phoebe,
 No! Wait! I was just saying that so you’d think I was a good person. Fight for me.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I’ve got friends too. Okay, bye.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch. (Exits.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. (Covers her face with her hand.) Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Maybe this is too weird.,,,,,Phoebe,
 No don’t tear out your eyes!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah try that. (He finishes and looks at her.) So, is that better?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Look Eric, turn around. (He does so.) Look, I like you, but it shouldn’t be this hard. Y’know? This is our first date y’know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ‘Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?’ and y’know first kisses and…(He kisses her)…second kisses. (Motions for him to kiss her again which he does and they start to make out.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really? That’s the thing I’m worse at! You’ll see. (Exits.),,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! (Jumps on the bed with him.) Can we pick up where we left off?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What s*x?,,,,,Phoebe,
 We didn’t have s*x.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (simultaneously as Eric) Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You-you…you had s*x with Ursula?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird.,,,,,Phoebe,
 So I guess this is it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, so do you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Huh?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Sure. Yeah, he’s kinda sexy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay so, we’ll just come up with some kind of signal if it’s going well you can take off.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh. Why not?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh Rachel, this is all so ‘Papa don’t preach.’",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow! Oh well, I will be there!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Gosh. I’m not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. (They both sit down by the rest of the gang and Phoebe recognizes a man by the window.) Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!!! Monica!! He’s the stripper from your bachelorette party!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Your secret bachelorette party…,,,,,Phoebe,
 She untied his G-string with her teeth. (Pause) Somebody stop me!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I-I don’t eat meat.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I don’t eat that either.",,,,,Phoebe,
" He’s right though, the ’74 is absolute piss.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Rachel!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Why, so he can get mad at the baby?",,,,,Phoebe,
 It’s slang for pregnant.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I’m really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.",,,,,Phoebe,
 It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I’d better go. (She goes and sits down in the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000, the chair that Sit magazine called chair of the year, and they both look at her.) Just over here: I don’t want to miss the fight.",,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s it?! You call that a fight? Come on! ""We were on a break!"" ""No we weren’t!"" What happened to you two?!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering, quietly) Wow, you told your dad the truth.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wanna go see a movie?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I brought you my old maternity clothes! (Sets a bag on the counter.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! And look, (Grabs the pants) see how they expand as the baby grows? (There’s a stretchy part in front.) And then after the baby’s born, they’re great for shoplifting melons.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Turkey’s are beautiful, intelligent animals!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Happy Thanksgiving!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Anything I can do to help?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. (She starts folding the napkins in half.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (To Chandler) So how’s the game?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t believe you! That is…brilliant! And Monica has no idea?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don’t think I can help you after all, I didn’t realize this game was on.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well normally I don’t, but y’know…(looks at the TV)…Green Bay is playing.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well it’s only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it’s not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }",,,,,Phoebe,
 (nonchalantly glancing) Hey. (Turns back around.) Wow! (Looks up.) Well done.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (simultaneously) Green Bay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay…Mermen.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I think you do.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?! What else did you do?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! (They all look.) Wow!,,,,,Phoebe,
" So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?",,,,,Phoebe,
 I wanna join!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn’t go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. (Goes over and hugs him.) It’s exactly how I’d imagined it would be.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Joey! Those are my maternity pants!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Is there anything we can do for you?,,,,,Phoebe,
 How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, ""I can’t wait to hear your first words,"" I thought, ""There’s a trick.""",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey Ross! Doesn’t Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Sting has a son that goes there too!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Sting’s son, seven years old and there’s a picture.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, it’s New York magazine. It’s an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-huh, yeah that’s too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it’s totally sold out. I know! Why don’t you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I’ll take you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That’s why you have kids!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! They’re beautiful!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well then get your money back and return them!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh no! Why not?,,,,,Phoebe,
 How come?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wait! But Ross if they don’t get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Your kid is seven?! (Ross nods, ""Yes."") (To the rest) He’s really small. (To Ross) Please! Please get the tickets!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes you can! Sting says so himself!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (singing) Rosssss can!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (singing) Rossss can!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (singing) Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, there you are Ben!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy’s name is Sting’s son.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Him you’re friends with. (Starts looking at the children trying to find Jack and a teacher notices her.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes! Yes you can, I’m looking for Jack’s parents.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-huh, I’m with Ben.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I am one of Ben’s mothers. I’m a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! Let’s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? ‘Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She’s such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! This place is incredible! (Gasps) Sting’s pen…that he gave to Phoebe. (Puts the pen in her purse and goes over to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase) Come on! Secret passageway! (Starts pulling books at random as Trudie enters.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why else would I be here?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh. (They go and sit down.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, I’m sorry. Won’t-won’t Jack’s father be joining us?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o’clock?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Concert. Yeah. That does put us in…quite a pickle. Because you see I’m very busy before and after the concert, and he’s obviously busy during.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, thank you. Four would be great.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh good! Then you’re in luck! Ben’s not my son!,,,,,Phoebe,
 The Police? Here? A reunion?! (She gets out her camera.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oo, where are the seats?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, now would you say that that’s more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Then that’s not breaking the law! I’m there!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
" He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he’s not that good in bed.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?",,,,,Phoebe,
" This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y’know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. Yeah, that’s what you need a good…pill.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (sitting down next to Ross) Y’know she has a face Ross!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Bye.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait, I’m-I’m sorry. What’s the big deal about a holiday card?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh hey! So, how did your doctor’s appointment go?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?",,,,,Phoebe,
 You wish.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh yeah? Come and get it.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ugh! Women!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Give her a key to your apartment.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, we hate that.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering with some guy) Hey. Ooh Ross! How’d the conversation go?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Where?! (Ross exits.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.",,,,,Phoebe,
" So umm, I’m gonna get us some drinks. (To Rachel) Would you help me out?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, he’s here to have s*x with you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You’re welcome.,,,,,Phoebe,
" It’s okay, he’s a virgin.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, okay let’s leave these two alone.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this! (Phoebe exits.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Hi. Listen, I’m sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn’t right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think you’ll really enjoy. (Goes into the hallway and returns carrying the Evander Holyfield cutout.) Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I’m gonna, I’m gonna want him back. So… (Looks at him longingly) I’m gonna go now. (Exits.) (Pause) (Entering) I’m sorry, I thought I could do it and I can’t! (She grabs the cutout and exits for good.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! I got you a present!!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!",,,,,Phoebe,
 It’s a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I didn’t know where to put it so I just left it here for now.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Do you really like it?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh really? What was your first?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! It’s not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering) Hey, you guys. Listen, I’m sorry that I was hogging the game before—(Sees the top ten list)—Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Chandler sucks! He couldn’t have gotten this good!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I know!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Don’t touch me!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I can’t!! I can’t!! (She dies.) Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh hi Ben—No!! Don’t look at the machine! (Covers the screen.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, are you going to find out the s*x of the baby?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Me too!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh huh! If it’s a girl, Phoebe, and if it’s a boy, Phoebo!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, by Sandrine.",,,,,Phoebe,
 How-how about you each get five vetoes?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (from outside the bathroom) You guys?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, just as well, I broke this one.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Fine.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (Groans) Is it Chandler?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, then tell him to stop staring!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?! Joey?! You don’t say.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No, I can’t. We’re friends. No, oh, no. I don’t want to risk what we have.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Sure, yeah. I mean, it’s Joey. I don’t want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, Joey, I know.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I knooow.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I know about your feelings.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, and I’m sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that’s very rare.",,,,,Phoebe,
" For God sakes, it’s Rachel!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah that’s Rachel. (To herself) Beat me over the head with it.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey, I just think you’re getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Absolutely! Y’know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.",,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I’ve had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I’m sure you’ve had them for us.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Mm-hmm. (To herself) Throw me a bone here.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, you were wrong, he doesn’t like me!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors’ house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn’t like you? How would you feel?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really? Lee Majors is hot!,,,,,Phoebe,
 We’re in the bathroom!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (checking for herself) (To Monica) Mazel tov.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Tell us what?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I left my guitar here again.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. (Monica closes the door, gets the guitar, and then hands it out.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Great! Ummâ€¦(Monica closes the door again and Phoebe knocks again.),,,,,Phoebe,
 So do you want to hang out or something?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh are you and Chandlerâ€¦,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! Youâ€™re getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You told me you hate massages!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I canâ€™t believe this! How long as this been going on?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it has a name?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okayâ€”Oop! Too late! Iâ€™m leaving! Come on Chandler letâ€™s go! (She storms out.),,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering) Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? (To Monica) You!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why wonâ€™t you let me massage you?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Monica! We lived together for years! Iâ€™ve seen you naked!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Iâ€™m curious about the human body.,,,,,Phoebe,
" But Iâ€™m a professional! And Iâ€™m really good! Look, if youâ€™re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?",,,,,Phoebe,
 It does! How would you feel if you couldnâ€™t share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldnâ€™t teach us about dragons.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Potato, potaato.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (calling from her room) Are you under the sheet?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (in a soothing voice) Great, letâ€™s begin. (She starts the massage.) Howâ€™s the pressure?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Stating the obvious, but thank you. And itâ€™s not weird is it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Thatâ€™s right, you just enjoy.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (getting uncomfortable) Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No-no, I got that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Okay but you should know though, Iâ€™ve raised my rates to $200 an hour.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I mean $500.,,,,,Phoebe,
600,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you make s*x noises when you get massaged!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really? Thereâ€™s nothing sexual about this? (Sexily) Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some cute guy is watching closely.) (To him) What are you looking at?! (Pause) I mean hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, you canâ€™t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well not clients, lovers. But letâ€™s just yâ€™know, try it again. Come back and-and weâ€™ll work through it.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Great! Okay, if youâ€™ll just excuse me. (To the guy) So, did you hear something you liked?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Thatâ€™s it. Just relax.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Come on more!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, you like that donâ€™t you?",,,,,Phoebe,
 You want it there? You take it there baby!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, say my name. Say it! (She stops when she realizes what sheâ€™s doing.) And now Iâ€™m going to cover you back up, and umm weâ€™re never doing this again.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! Hey, Rach!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you, too.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (sighs) Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?",,,,,Phoebe,
" So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ugh. Come on, Mona, don’t kiss ass.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!",,,,,Phoebe,
 It’s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. Candy’s the mother, Cookie’s the daughter. The father’s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, Monica, grow up!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (knocking and entering) Hey. Look, I know you’ve been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.",,,,,Phoebe,
 He-hee!,,,,,Phoebe,
" This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!",,,,,Phoebe,
 How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Taffy, really? I’ve never had any.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. (Ross hands her one) Thank you! So what, you’re just never going to tell her?",,,,,Phoebe,
" If I haven’t said it before: she’s a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going to—what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? (Referring to the taffy, which she’s been chewing this whole time.) Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? What’s the deal? (she swallows it, finally) Oh, it’s nice! May I try a pink one?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, buddy. How’s my favorite dog, huh? How’s my favorite dog? (the dog doesn’t move) You’re subdued. (to Joey) Did you give him a beer?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.",,,,,Phoebe,
 He’s miserable! What happened to him?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What stuff?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh…Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I’m going to take him back to Wendy’s.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Oh hey you guys!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, good.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well last night, I met Monica’s.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Well he’s tall.,,,,,Phoebe,
 He has brown hair.,,,,,Phoebe,
 He works with food!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Obviously, and he’s British.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah? And, he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I’m so sorry. Um, and maybe I’m wrong! I but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again, I’ll find out more.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (cough talks) Soul mate.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…,,,,,Phoebe,
" They’re just talking, and y’know what? Just because I think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Don’t worry, we’ll find you someone else.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m so sorry.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don’t know how you fight that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life is it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh, I see a ladder. (Checks the book) Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who’s next?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. (Reads the leaves) Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! (Checking the book) Which can either mean you’re having a baby or you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm… Wow, all right. (Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh, I’m gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he’s gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait a second you guys…for the last couple weeks I’ve been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he’s the tea guy. (He gets up to leave, and smiles at Phoebe.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh hello.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around and the exchange information.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Isn’t it funny how we kept running into each other? It’s as if someone really wants us to be together.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, witty banter. Well done.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh okay, well I’m a masseuse, and I used to work at this place…",,,,,Phoebe,
" I-I-I like, I like parties.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah I guess, a little.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (a little freaked out) So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for umm—Well since I was fourteen.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh stop it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong. But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! You do?,,,,,Phoebe,
 All right. (Gets up and walks out.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh there it is.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store…",,,,,Phoebe,
 A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that’s what they gave me? (Looks up) When I get up there I’m going to kick some ass.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, we both can. And we both will.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you didn’t have to come in with me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?",,,,,Phoebe,
 A little. (She turns around and looks up.) (To the universe) Now you’re talking.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I-I-I’d love to. Let me just tell my friend.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (looking around) She must’ve left.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent’s anniversary party?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is…",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I’ll go with you,,,,,Phoebe,
 Were you guys making fun of Parker?,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, he a little enthusiastic, what’s wrong with that?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you’ve dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don’t do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? ‘Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who’s who of human crap. (Walks off)",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I’m fine. I’m great. I’m with you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hm huh, yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, that’s not necessary.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, actually I don’t eat…",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, fine! Fine! (Takes the oyster and pretends to eat it while dropping it on the floor) Mmm…hmmmmm….",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why don’t you just try one?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Then you better do it now.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Because I’m going to kill him,,,,,Phoebe,
" You guys were right. He’s just too excited about…everything. I mean I’m all for living life, but this is the Geller’s 35th anniversary. Okay? Let’s call a spade a spade this party stinks.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you sure it wasn’t an oyster?,,,,,Phoebe,
 He’s just such a great guy I’m so excited about him.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You think?,,,,,Phoebe,
" You’re right. You’re right, he’s just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I’m a sunny, positive person.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What’s that now?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh look it’s Parker!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oooh I love it!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh thank God.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don’t we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Let’s try something else, let’s play a game.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Shocking! Let’s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest. (Giggles),,,,,Phoebe,
" But, let’s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn’t perfect? Everything isn’t magical? Everything isn’t a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You don’t have to put a good spin on everything.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Much less happy!,,,,,Phoebe,
 So long! Don’t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out! (He exits and she slams the door behind him.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh huh. (Closes door),,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh. Finally! Oh. (Sits back in relief.),,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (interrupting him) I was just being polite!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, I…I just think you don’t expect someone so hot to be so sweet.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, Phoebe Buffay.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh okay, it’s P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as in ebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in (In an Australian accent) ‘Ello there mate!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohhh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh, tough call.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, please!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well I don’t, I don’t have a mother so often I forget that other people…",,,,,Phoebe,
 No. (Pause) Neither is mine.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I know. I know, what’s her number?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Isn’t it at three?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That’s good right?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What? He’s gonna be dressed as a baby! (Mrs. Green enters.) Oh hi Mrs. Green!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m so glad you could make it.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah I know. Isn’t it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No look, we’ve apologized twice! I can’t do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.",,,,,Phoebe,
 For how long?,,,,,Phoebe,
 She can’t hear you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, if you don’t want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It’s time to open the presents!,,,,,Phoebe,
" How about you less important people, let’s open your presents!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, come on Rach it’s present time! Y’know you’re the glue that’s holding this whole party together. It’s kinda falling apart here.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, this is from your friend at work.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Not if you were here.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, not a thing.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she’s been nothing but terrible to you. And don’t forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn’t even thanked you for it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I’d tell her off.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (To Monica) Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up…",,,,,Phoebe,
 You were fantastic! I’m so proud of you!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You should be!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You got it!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well that’s no way to sell newspapers. Why don’t you try, ""Extra! Extra! Read all about it!""",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well did she know you two weren’t married?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Sounds like you’re a little jealous.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Is that a real place? (Rachel’s stunned) Are they hiring?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey Chandler, why so fancy?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait, I think I know someone who does that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, just don’t get your hopes up.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, the interview…",,,,,Phoebe,
 Y’know! You don’t make a very good first impression.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh you don’t know.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, when I first met you, you were like, ""Blah, blah, blah."" I was like, shhh!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well it’s just like you’re trying too hard. Always making jokes, y’know, you just—You come off a little needy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! It’s okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, don’t freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?",,,,,Phoebe,
 I can’t help you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, all right, we’ll just do our best. Okay? So let’s say I’m the interviewer and I’m meeting you for the first time. Okay. ""Hi! Come on in, I’m uh, Regina Philange.""",,,,,Phoebe,
" Bing, what an unusual name.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Um-hmm, that’s good to know. But let’s stop focusing on what you don’t do, and start focusing on what you do do.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You gotta go!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, don’t worry. You’re ready.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you’ll be great.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I started that!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh I know, I’ve been there. I remember toward the end…",,,,,Phoebe,
 Or you can do volunteer work.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster) Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe—Burrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going off.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.",,,,,Phoebe,
" When she comes out, you hold her nose, I’ll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don’t know. I-I think it’s still gonna be a while.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You’re on!,,,,,Phoebe,
 One hundred thousand dollars!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Fine! I’ll call Zurich and move some money around.,,,,,Phoebe,
 No one’s here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you’re still pregnant. Oh, I’m sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.",,,,,Phoebe,
" It’s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Fine! You’re on!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp (She puts the bill in her bra) right there.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Good God man don’t anger it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh I-I don’t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had s*x the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank you!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Is Rachel having the baby?,,,,,Phoebe,
 They’re at the coffeehouse.,,,,,Phoebe,
 We know it’s a girl! (Exits.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh you made it!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (looking at the clock) Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure! What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, this is fun.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. (Pause) Why aren’t you with Rachel?,,,,,Phoebe,
 But y’know what? It just seems that you two belong together.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Right. And with who again? (Ross exits.),,,,,Phoebe,
 I know!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it ate your money?",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, I’ll see you downstairs then.",,,,,Phoebe,
 All right.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh down please. (The guy tries to reach the button, but can’t.) I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it? (She pushes the button.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it’s a long story. It’s kind of embarrassing. Let’s just say there was a typographical error with a s*x manual. (The guy laughs.) How about you?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-huh, yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh yeah! I-I would like that.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (to the nurse) Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I’m looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he’s like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hands.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank you. (Starts to exit.),,,,,Phoebe,
 (coming back for Joey) No! (Grabs Joey and drags him away.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, this is it! (Looks in the window.) Oh, that’s him! That’s him!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what’s he like. People tell doctors everything.",,,,,Phoebe,
" But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What else? What else?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh. Ah-uh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Enter Pheebs.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay I’ve got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Somebody went to college. Wow. (Cliff gets uncomfortable) What is it? I’m sorry. (She moves her arm, which was resting on the same pillow his leg is.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I’ll get it. (She gets up and grabs a spoon.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Relax, it’s not like we’re forking.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Y’know what? This one is. (Eats another spoonful of pudding as Cliff sees something on TV.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Okay. I—Okay umm…this…I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y’know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I’m coming off right now.",,,,,Phoebe,
" You’re right, that was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. It’s just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh Joey, we’re trying to dial down the crazy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Umm, look we don’t, we don’t really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don’t know about you but that doesn’t happen to me a lot.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Can we come in?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, she’s so beautiful.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, my turn. My turn. (Joey hands her to Phoebe.) Oh! You’re so cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! (Pause) I won’t.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ohhh. (Hands her back to Rachel.),,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yay!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Is she in there?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I just can’t decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?",,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m sorry, for the last time, why aren’t you two together again? (Silence from Ross.) No, I know. I know, because you’re not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah that’s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Right. (Pause) Or you might get everything you’ve wanted since you were fifteen.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (To Monica) Oh and I need to talk to you.,,,,,Phoebe,
 To see if know what these guys are talking about.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (taking Ross aside) Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yay! It’s so exciting! Wow, you could’ve done that with us there.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can’t talk to Rachel.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you all right?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! He did it?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Especially Ross!,,,,,Phoebe,
" There he goes, your fiancée.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Although he does play with himself in his sleep.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh hey! Wait up!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey ‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secret thing in a long time.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that she’s sleeping.) Should we wake her up?",,,,,Phoebe,
 And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?,,,,,Phoebe,
 So whose ring is it?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Is it an engagement ring?,,,,,Phoebe,
 But you didn’t give it to her?,,,,,Phoebe,
 But you were going to propose?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Huh, I might be losing interest in this.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No they ran out of ""It’s a girl"" but I can fix this one, (She writes ""not"" in between it’s and a) See?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Look at all the stuff people sent!,,,,,Phoebe,
 She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow you guys got a hospital? Fancy!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I dunno, well he got over the ""We were on a break"" thing really quickly.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You know that’s… that’s her.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you’re never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I can say I told you so but she’s kinda doing that for me.,,,,,Phoebe,
 It really does… how long do you think we have to stay?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having s*x with Ross!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay? That’s just what she wants.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh I’m kinda part of this.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I knew I should have married Chandler.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I’m just gonna go. (She gets up and Rachel looks at her, upset, and Monica just stares.) No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right! (She sits back down.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, I’ll try, fine! Yes, Okay!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Shh! Nothing works with this child! (Hands her back.),,,,,Phoebe,
 I have to go scream into a pillow. (Goes to scream into a pillow),,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Have I gone deaf?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You must be a fireball in bed.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I can hear traffic and birds! I can hear the voices in my head again! (Monica looks at her strangely) I’m kidding. (She smiles wickedly.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Thankfully you don’t need me at all (gets up and to leave) so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel let’s give it six to eight months (she leaves).,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I call their apartment!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Look at you all grown up.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Done. Oh good, really?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Let's see! (Opens her address book.) Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller",,,,,Phoebe,
 (Enters) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 So how is this for our big double date tonight? (She is all dressed up),,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on, give me something. What's his name?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Mike? Okay! What's his last name?,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...",,,,,Phoebe,
" You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Do you not know each other?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (To Joey) You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Who are you kidding? (To Joey) You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm out of here (She leaves),,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why did you go along with that?,,,,,Phoebe,
" That's true. (Pause) Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Prove it.,,,,,Phoebe,
 That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.,,,,,Phoebe,
 You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uhuh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (To Mike) Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Bye Chandler.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, bye-bye! (Pushes Chandler out the door.) Good trip! (Slams the door)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh hey Ross oh I'm so glad someone's here could you zip me up?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank you. Can you believe no-one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me?,,,,,Phoebe,
 oh umm Mike's picking me up for a date.,,,,,Phoebe,
" oh I dunno I dunno, you know I mean I like him but am I ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market.",,,,,Phoebe,
 yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I wouldn't say never, you know there's that guy (pause) well what about (pause) ok well there's gotta be someone.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my god you're right.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I can't believe I never realized this before, I'm in my thirty's and never been in a long-term relationship oh my god (starts crying) what's wrong with me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I wanna get married (grabs a tissue),,,,,Phoebe,
" least you've been married, OH MY GOD! I wanna trade lives with Ross (cries more)",,,,,Phoebe,
" nothing, I'm excited about our date, Mike this is Ross Geller this is Mike Haaaaa (starts crying)",,,,,Phoebe,
 uh huh (terns to Ross) how do I look (all her make up has gone everywhere),,,,,Phoebe,
 (goes to cry) No,,,,,Phoebe,
 well it was awful every time I thought about what you said I started crying.,,,,,Phoebe,
 would you call this girl? (Puts on a crying act) thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing,,,,,Phoebe,
" well you not what you should feel terrible about, this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?",,,,,Phoebe,
 It's open.,,,,,Phoebe,
 HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY! (She dances around with happiness),,,,,Phoebe,
 What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!,,,,,Phoebe,
 WHAT!,,,,,Phoebe,
 WHAT! WHY?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (Walks towards Ross) If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him.",,,,,Phoebe,
" yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh (takes a deep breath and sits down, knock on the door)",,,,,Phoebe,
 ok,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh huh yeah (stands up) there's just something umm, there's something you should know (Pause) Vicrum just called.",,,,,Phoebe,
" .and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.",,,,,Phoebe,
 yeah well (pause) yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You know that b*st*rd is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 ok I can't do this.,,,,,Phoebe,
" well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so. (Pause) if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close my eye's make it less awkward (She sits with her eyes closed and Mike kisses her, Phoebe opens her eyes and like a little child says.) You kissed me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 so you don't think I'm a total freak,,,,,Phoebe,
" I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and Phoebe pulls back) and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.",,,,,Phoebe,
" you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh hey you guys, I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.",,,,,Phoebe,
 So?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No! It's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think it's a little to soon to show my true colors.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, Rachel!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yay!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven't been together the six of us in such a long time.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (from outside) Trick or treat! (It's obviously Halloween eve, the night of her birthday dinner.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, and treat it is. (Monica's breasts.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, so glad I changed. Almost weared my ??? outfit that can't contain my breasts.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ohh. Oh wait! (Jis) you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you?",,,,,Phoebe,
" 'kay, see you there. Happy humping! (outside meeting Chandler.) Hey...hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?",,,,,Phoebe,
 You smoked!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (smells at him) Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound ... and the breasts of a great goddess.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (embarrassed) I'm gonna go. (leaves to stairs),,,,,Phoebe,
 Where is everyone? They're forty minutes late.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate nothing all day.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Joseph! (to waiter) Thou needn't worry, they shan't be long.",,,,,Phoebe,
 One really does have a stick up one's ass. Doesn't one?,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, you can't go. No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, fine, I'll move. Alright, you don't have to manhandle me. (gets up) Where? (he points at a smaller table) Okay. Thank you. Watch.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I guess they're not coming. You wanna just order?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Both it is, thank you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?,,,,,Phoebe,
 And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wher-where have you been?,,,,,Phoebe,
" You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Aw ... what?,,,,,Phoebe,
 's a good toast.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (getting up) Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! (everybody scared) I'm sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) Well, it's too late now.",,,,,Phoebe,
" well, this is, this is, this is not over! (on phone) Hello?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (returns) Okay, that was Mike.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, mkay, I'm gonna take off.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I'm not t--not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! (waves to the bar) Judy! Bye.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know! (Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want to let go of Mike's hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I kinda do. (Mike lets go of her hand) Well, how's this? (she takes Mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. After that, they hold hands again. Joey now enters, and sees the two sitting on the couch, holding hands.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (in a flash she answers) Maybe not, is it?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (impatient) I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (really surprised) Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, I want to.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 It really is.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (gasps) Oh my God! David!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (excited) No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Who cares, it got you here.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow. Where is your luggage? (David thinks for a while),,,,,Phoebe,
" A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No...,,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?,,,,,Phoebe,
 He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really? Chandler?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (sarcastically) Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay. (and she walks away),,,,,Phoebe,
" No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oof...,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, wait, wait!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I should have told you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I am happy.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Of course, yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...",,,,,Phoebe,
" I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the door and turns around again)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... (They kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... it's... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no. No.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...",,,,,Phoebe,
 (points to David) And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, well, yeah...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! (they stop and Phoebe gets David's jacket and gives it to him) Here David, you should just go.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, well... guys?",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Right! Never! Never! I swear! (They kiss... The door opens and David comes in again.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's,,,,,Phoebe,
 (sarcastically) Really? That hadn't occurred to me.,,,,,Phoebe,
 They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, so... allright... Which dress? (she holds up two 'Phoebe'",,,,,Phoebe,
 So... now... What about with Mike's mom?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (speaking louder and articulating) That's she's like the daughter,,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm wearing pantyhose!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, so... They gotta die someday. (Mike's parents walk in) HELLO!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (in a very posh accent) Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!,,,,,Phoebe,
 And you... Your home is lovely.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Holy crap!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, try and stop me!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (no accent) I'm trying to get your parents to like me.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (accent) Got it! It... It's hard to stop...,,,,,Phoebe,
" (no accent) Uhm... Okay, well, allright, uhm... Originally I'm from",,,,,Phoebe,
 God! God! This is not going well.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being myself?",,,,,Phoebe,
 So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah I bet! Look out! (Phoebe punches Theodore right in the stomach),,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, are you okay?",,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm so sorry!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I really, really am sorry.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes... I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents before...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, I can talk to",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again",,,,,Phoebe,
 Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know,,,,,Phoebe,
" (Mike now enters and stands behind Phoebe) Oh no, no, no, no, no,",,,,,Phoebe,
" ...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat, Sme-lly ca-t /",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, Pervert Parade?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh God! Is that veal?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I mean, I'm... I am",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals: kittens, fish",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah... The woman you what?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I love you too...,,,,,Phoebe,
 YEAH...! How great is this...? (they kiss),,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I had a great time. (accent) It was really top drawer. And here's,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, what's going on Joe?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh okay. How about the whole ""man walking on the moon"" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Sure, what.. what was the work thing?",,,,,Phoebe,
" ""Pick up grandma at the airport""?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Thats a great movie. <she claps>,,,,,Phoebe,
 PHOE-BE.,,,,,Phoebe,
 There's your movie! <claps>,,,,,Phoebe,
 It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, what happened?",,,,,Phoebe,
 No! Nothing with a raccoon.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?,,,,,Phoebe,
 It's all right. You can mourn.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Broke them all, huh?",,,,,Phoebe,
 You gonna tell her?,,,,,Phoebe,
 No problem! Next week: stealing... (Chandler walks away to store the box of broken china.),,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh. You’re first night out, indeed!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, god. Do you remember the girls’ nights that we used to have? Sitting around, talking about you and Ross?",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know.,,,,,Phoebe,
 So what’s going on with you and Ross?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Woah! Oh my god! I love things! What happened?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Eye contact?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I hope you were using protection.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Should we send them something back? Yes, let’s do! Let’s send them mashed potatoes!!",,,,,Phoebe,
" So, what if they do?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but, um, nothing has to happen. Just having fun. You know, not everything has to go as far as ‘eye contact’.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I’m sorry. We weren’t really looking for anything to happen with you guys. I-I have a boyfriend.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my god! You’re giving your real number!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow. So that's great. You, Bill, Ross and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?",,,,,Phoebe,
 But what about Ross? What about your moment? Don’t you want to talk to Ross about it?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation. But your Rachel was not whiney enough.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Better!,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, really? Are you moving on from Ross?",,,,,Phoebe,
 You kinda just did. That guy’s gonna call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone. That’s a pretty clear message.,,,,,Phoebe,
" [As Rachel] “Ah, I have to get my number back!”, “Oh my god! He’s gone!” Dead on!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey Mike, it’s me. Listen: Is Ross near you?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, you have to go back in.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m so sorry, honey, but, okay. Rachel gave this guy her number, and, erm, she does not want Ross to answer the phone, so you have to intercept all of his calls.",,,,,Phoebe,
 [To Rachel] He says that he can’t do that,,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, give it here. [Phoebe takes the phone] Hello? I'm sorry about her, but, she wasn’t wrong about the dirty stuff.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, oh, Mike! Bye. [Hangs up]",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, goodbye!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I’ll be right back. I just have to go to the bathroom.,,,,,Phoebe,
" ...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;",,,,,Phoebe,
 (smiling) Uh-huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I like my job.",,,,,Phoebe,
" So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern",,,,,Phoebe,
" No-no, we do it every year!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, we have to!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well then, you should look with us.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, that's it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea! Oh yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh ooh, we have a live one!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, who's it for?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I",,,,,Phoebe,
 You guuuyys.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (simultaneous to the others) Ble-blah-blar Blargh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (simultaneous to the others) Blah blargah, blar-blab.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (at the window) Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Aren't we done with that?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could",,,,,Phoebe,
 Now give me my real gift.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (to Chandler) Thank you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You could do that?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, really?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, now. What?",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, that helps.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey. So, what did he say?",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Joey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Who dies?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, doctor.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (Does the scene) Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, from the top, people!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?,,,,,Phoebe,
 About what?,,,,,Phoebe,
 And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No. It starts with a ""v"" and ends with an ""x"". Helpfully with a ""to"" in the middle.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (relived) Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What are those?,,,,,Phoebe,
" OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.",,,,,Phoebe,
" So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers. (Mike throws out everything in his mouth)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey Mikey,,,,,Phoebe,
 What are you doing?,,,,,Phoebe,
 To kill Bob??,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? (starts looking) Bob! Robert! (looks at cabinet under sink) Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my god, we killed Bob!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Suzie? (Runs over there to check),,,,,Phoebe,
" Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help. (she and Mike leave)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... (starts counting with her fingers) That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You must think I'm crazy.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I haven't told you about that yet, have I?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (walks in) Hey,,,,,Phoebe,
" Listen, I think I've left something here.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (likes the jacket) No, but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (realizes) Ooh, maybe that's him!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Well it depends.,,,,,Phoebe,
 On how far along he's in the s*x change process!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow! Talking about high maintenance,,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm a woman!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?",,,,,Phoebe,
" But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?,,,,,Phoebe,
 OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.,,,,,Phoebe,
 While drinking...,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my god.,,,,,Phoebe,
" It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!",,,,,Phoebe,
" ""No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!"" Thank you!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.,,,,,Phoebe,
 But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.,,,,,Phoebe,
 All the time when you're cooking.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah you're always singing ""Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy""",,,,,Phoebe,
 OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone",,,,,Phoebe,
 Can you totally see through her shirt ?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Every little bit of you!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Mon', not that you didn’t sound good, but...",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh you’ll probably take care of that on your hands.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, she gives the people what they want.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh? Isn’t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What you got?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I just wish they'd realise they should be together.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.",,,,,Phoebe,
" So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. (BEAT) Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my ""plan-laugh."" (A maniacal laugh follows.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, Joey. ",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight. ,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
 A teacher?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman! ",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 How do you even know a woman like that?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Joey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 So now what do we do?,,,,,Phoebe,
" What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's not Santa's plan. No, it's... (Laughs the real ""plan-laugh."")",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I think we killed it.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hello?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, Rach!",,,,,Phoebe,
" You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends. ",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Did he go out for a cigarette? ,,,,,Phoebe,
" My dear, sweet Rach.",,,,,Phoebe,
" By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico. (BEAT) Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?",,,,,Phoebe,
 How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Mexico!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What's your news?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (inquisitive) Gosh, what's the pay like? (Everybody stares at her indignantly) Oh, come on people… (defending) come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! (She looks at Joey) Hey Joey! (Joey winks at her)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (enthusiastic) That's great.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I hear divorce bells. ",,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Lowell, is that you?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (simultaneously) Oh my god! ,,,,,Phoebe,
" (excited) I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ah, it's been so long, so long. (They hug again) I can't believe you're still doing this!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Good for you! ,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ouh… (she nods),,,,,Phoebe,
" Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up…",,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us. ,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know… sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I…",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony… I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer…",,,,,Phoebe,
 She was a drug dealer!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (laughing) Okay…,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (worried) You were?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (shocked) Oh my god…,,,,,Phoebe,
" No… actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street… that's where stabby Joe works. ",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, I think we have a problem here. ",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics. ",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat. ",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know… I mugged Ross! ,,,,,Phoebe,
" (spotting Ross) Hey, you!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, how was class?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Nothing, I really wanna know.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (interrupting) Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make… uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid…",,,,,Phoebe,
" You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, it was. ",,,,,Phoebe,
" (interrupting, pinching his year) ""Gimme your money, punk!""",,,,,Phoebe,
" (apologetic) Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. (She smiles at him, but he doesn't understand) I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have… have a great one! ",,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say…",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really? Even more humiliating than…,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, Ross! (He lowers his newspaper and scowls at her) I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second? ",,,,,Phoebe,
 I just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting. ,,,,,Phoebe,
" Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell… or smoke. (Ross looks at her in astonishment) Anyway, I was looking through it and I found ""Science Boy"" (She holds up some sheets of paper and hands them to Ross)",,,,,Phoebe,
" I can't say, I just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day. ",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah… but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here. ",,,,,Phoebe,
" You're welcome. And thank you for ""Science Boy"". I learned a lot from him ",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why??,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I want you to stay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why don't you turn them inside ou...,,,,,Phoebe,
 I'll miss you.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say ""Hell yeah!""",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! (They embrace and Mike kisses Phoebe) Oh god, we're really going to move in together!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I've always wanted to live with a guy. ""Pick up your socks!"" ""Put down the toilet seat!"" ""No! We're not having s*x anymore!"" It's gonna be fun!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh huh...we're playing you two.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! You bet roomy!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns. (Mike seems to gag a little...and laughs nervously. They begin to leave. Phoebe bolts back)",,,,,Phoebe,
 China patterns!!!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What do you mean?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh. Wow.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Was it really that bad?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.",,,,,Phoebe,
 But it's just...,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh!,,,,,Phoebe,
 No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah I get that.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi,,,,,Phoebe,
" Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.",,,,,Phoebe,
 No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Never.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!",,,,,Phoebe,
 That's not how you really feel is it?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Seriously? You divorce-o?,,,,,Phoebe,
 It's ok that's how you feel.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I do love Mike.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.,,,,,Phoebe,
 It's not cooler.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Better.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What do you mean?,,,,,Phoebe,
 They are awfully boxy...,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Right. Except that I do want to get married.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Someday.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you gonna change yours?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't want it to end either.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! (pause) Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (after a pause) Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.",,,,,Phoebe,
 That was a test and you just failed.,,,,,Phoebe,
" God, I wish Mike were here.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Here.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to Monica)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You can't have it.,,,,,Phoebe,
 No (tucks it in her pants),,,,,Phoebe,
 (disbelievingly) Oh yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!,,,,,Phoebe,
" You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Those are my shoes.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I ordered Chinese food.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?,,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.",,,,,Phoebe,
 There is a speakerphone on the base unit...,,,,,Phoebe,
 Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Sit down.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Thanks, you look good too.",,,,,Phoebe,
 So how's the piano playing going?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I've missed you too.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I missed you so much! (she kisses Mike)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Who is this?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey will you get me tickets too?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You don't wanna win the lottery?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (excited)Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I hope I win!,,,,,Phoebe,
" One, two, three!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Get a room!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oooh, I like that, ""daddy"" (in a sexy tone)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (still in sexy tone) Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together (takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (she takes the bowl from Rachel's hands and she starts running around the room and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (keeping on running and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH! (she stops) Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! (she goes out to the balcony)",,,,,Phoebe,
" If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! (She holds out the bowl, and makes as to drop the tickets on the street).",,,,,Phoebe,
 Don't come any closer!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, what's more important, your friends or money?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, good! (pause) You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring Phoebe who drops the bowl on the street) Oh God, no! (pause) I think I broke your bowl.",,,,,Phoebe,
" What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.",,,,,Phoebe,
" So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?",,,,,Phoebe,
" As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. (pause ) So, excuse me for being a little skittish.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Guys, the drawing is about to start!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm still looking through mine...,,,,,Phoebe,
" You guys, what was the Powerball number again?",,,,,Phoebe,
 We won.,,,,,Phoebe,
 We won!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Don't tear it.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (still very excited) I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!",,,,,Phoebe,
 It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I beg to differ (shows him her cup of coffee and her plate of cookies).,,,,,Phoebe,
" (hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the ""pigeon voice"" from before) Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! (pause) Seriously, stop staring at her.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!",,,,,Phoebe,
 And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (playing guitar and singing) And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, ""You suck"" and ""shut up and go home"".",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 But what?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (pause) Ok, say no more.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (with a fancy dress, still playing and singing): It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to Monica, showing her dress) Classy, uh?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot).",,,,,Phoebe,
 My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah well, ""excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it""!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Well...it's not about quality.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?",,,,,Phoebe,
" What are people having, the garlic Martini?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..,,,,,Phoebe,
" You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands).",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand),,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm sorry too... (they hug),,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...,,,,,Phoebe,
" (smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What is it?,,,,,Phoebe,
" I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ah, ah.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?,,,,,Phoebe,
 And that horrible museum tour!,,,,,Phoebe,
 We know about your party Joey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? (Looks around)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey Ross!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, What's the matter?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Worse?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks),,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.",,,,,Phoebe,
" You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of slippers),,,,,Phoebe,
 I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom),,,,,Phoebe,
" (coming back from the bathroom) What's up? (she sees the gift certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these ""big massage places""! They're putting people like me out of business!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, do you care about friendship?",,,,,Phoebe,
" I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Promise?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate),,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?",,,,,Phoebe,
 But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.,,,,,Phoebe,
 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (In a strange heavy accent) Hello ""ja"", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, then I'm Swedish...",,,,,Phoebe,
 It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ja!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Is something wrong?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (Singing) ""Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! "" And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, Ja! Ja!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!,,,,,Phoebe,
 You know it's me?,,,,,Phoebe,
 How can you come here?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't have to tell you everything!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Tips not included.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ok.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch, she came back?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (through the door, with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (entering and talking on mobile phone) Ok, great! All right, bye! (she hangs up) Pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) That's off, right?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like ""Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!"". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Exactly!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (after a short pause) I didn't even think about that! (pause) Aaargh, sexual politics!!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, that'll be great!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I'll take some of that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) Yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (picks up a dress) Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ok!,,,,,Phoebe,
" So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Who else?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You like Joey?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (whispering) Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Sure!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (sticks her head out) I didn't say anything yet!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (goes back in) I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (comes out too) Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ooh! We have a problem.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Good plan.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at ""who's more over who""! (at which she walks away)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.",,,,,Phoebe,
" You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.",,,,,Phoebe,
 David?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! (they hug),,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. What-what are you doing here?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What happened?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Good!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (disappointed) Oh, good for you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Mike and I broke up.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Really?,,,,,Phoebe,
" I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Well... (pause) no.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I'd love to.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ok. (they walk away together),,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Mike?? Who's Mike?,,,,,Phoebe,
" That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (shouts after David) Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Not Joey.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Are you leaving ""The Supremes""? (Monica and Phoebe go to one side)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow? Really? That's fantastic!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: ""Mike, do you take Phoebe..."" (gestures with her hand as if someone is covering her mouth and tries to shout ""No! No!"") You know, it's every girl's dream!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Sure, ok, yeah.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, Mike!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, Mike's here.",,,,,Phoebe,
" What are you, what are you doing here?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) No!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.",,,,,Phoebe,
" David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes! (they hug),,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (Grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) Not you guys. You got it going on!",,,,,Phoebe,
 ... and...?,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Nobody wins!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I'm out.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!",,,,,Phoebe,
 No idea! I though he was soft like you!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (picks up a coin from her bra) Monica, you call it.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Tails!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (smiling proudly) He was a lawyer!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (looking at Mike) Oh, yeah! (turning to Chandler) Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?",,,,,Phoebe,
" C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (pointing at Mike and shouting) I sleep with him!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Mike) Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Mike wins?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You can't do that!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.",,,,,Phoebe,
 It's like watching p0rn!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...",,,,,Phoebe,
 Is that Ross?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Sounds like he's with someone.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh that tart... floozy... giant...,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (whispering) Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Get over here!,,,,,Phoebe,
 We've got shoes being kicked off over here.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free p0rn! (Chandler eagerly rushes over)",,,,,Phoebe,
 That's the door. He's gone...,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa... (she walks away from the wall)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Now, what is this?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, have you guys seen Monica?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...",,,,,Phoebe,
 Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...",,,,,Phoebe,
 Aaah... you're not good at this...,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why not?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You have a... You have a date? With who?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (lets go of his hand) You have... have a girlfriend?,,,,,Phoebe,
 For how long?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" You know what, we're gonna have s*x. Let's just leave it there.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hi, Mike's place.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, that was fast.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (stunned) I... I'm Phoebe.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Enchanté (she holds out her hand, and they shake hands)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I don't...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, not a fan of the tough love.",,,,,Phoebe,
" But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You're welcome!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey guys!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, what's all this stuff?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, how does it work?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Good to see you.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..",,,,,Phoebe,
" That's a, that's a long time.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Insane.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Alice would never go for it, right?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Frank Jr.Jr.?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, so that leaves Chandler.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Still, he had to find out sometime.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.",,,,,Phoebe,
" You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? (apes Amanda in a british accent) ""Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!"" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!""",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I know! ""Oh...I slept with Billy Joel"". All right, who hasn't?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ugh, Let's just cut her out!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, you’re right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, don’t hold thy breath!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Why, why, why didn’t you just say no!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (leaving) Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I did!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (makes a face) Are you kidding, I love it!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Musty!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Well...kinda.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah well, in America you're just an ""ass"".",,,,,Phoebe,
 (Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my God. Was Mike with him?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Please, Monica? In the hall?",,,,,Phoebe,
" It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I guess you're right.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey, it's a birthday party.",,,,,Phoebe,
 So you’re gonna... hit on her?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Or you could stick a fork in an apple!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Separate performances.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Sure, yeah!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (to Joey) Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?,,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music. (she starts singing) Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading (she picks up a book). “s*x and the single mother. (pause) Finding your G-spot.",,,,,Phoebe,
" And you know, I have a massage client soon.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! (Phoebe and Joey run towards the bathroom and enter),,,,,Phoebe,
" No, it did not.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Joey? How could you just let them leave?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, lets just draw straws.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (Visibly excited) Yeah!! Let's do that!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ok! I want the dolphin!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm too excited!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Go! Go!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Good job Alan!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, see you later!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh good, I didn't miss the party.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (pointing at cake) Hey, you made it into a bunny.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (yelling at the top of her voice) Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy b*st*rd!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.",,,,,Phoebe,
 YEAH!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have s*x in a public rest room.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. (looking at her ticket). Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they’re in my seat. It's my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Can’t believe it's been a whole year!",,,,,Phoebe,
 ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!,,,,,Phoebe,
 YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) IT’S OUR ANNIVERSARY!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it’s the worst way to propose!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, mine was worse than that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (To Rachel and Ross) Well, do you think I should propose?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, ok, so how should I do it?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points to Ross and Chandler) like that?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted)",,,,,Phoebe,
 I'm not. I'm praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I think you should wait.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered),,,,,Phoebe,
 That's not very enlightened!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!",,,,,Phoebe,
" That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's in the cake, isn't it?",,,,,Phoebe,
" What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly),,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I love you more!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (she enters) Hey...,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this... (she shows her ring) HUGE engagement ring!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Thank you! (to Rachel) Oh, and I have something for you!",,,,,Phoebe,
" It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I would, but you're the last one.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, my first love!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Dead. (everyone is a bit upset) Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (proud of herself) Oh yes, they are.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (looking at Monica entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?",,,,,Phoebe,
 A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Why, you don't like her?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really? You think?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hi! Sorry, I'm late.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. (she flips the coin). Tails! Monica, she's yours!",,,,,Phoebe,
" (smiling from ear to ear) Well, Gladys say hello to your new home! (she holds out the 'painting')",,,,,Phoebe,
" (genuinely excited about it) Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey! (there's a pause),,,,,Phoebe,
 You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls are hovering.) Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.),,,,,Phoebe,
 I knew it!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!",,,,,Phoebe,
 So what did you two do about it?,,,,,Phoebe,
" But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one (she gives him a check)",,,,,Phoebe,
 And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts! (she takes a t-shirt which was on the counter)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Mhm... it's moist.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Hello, is this the creepy residence?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing a veil, I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, no, we’re not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.",,,,,Phoebe,
" We, you know, we’re different! We don’t care about having a huge party. (She picks up the veil) This is really nice for you, but, oh, please, I put this on? (she puts it on) And, ow, I look (she looks her reflex image on a toaster), why, well, radiant. (pause) All right, well, who cares, I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.",,,,,Phoebe,
 City Hall.,,,,,Phoebe,
" It’s ok, it’s ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I’ll just ask for it back!",,,,,Phoebe,
" It’s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.",,,,,Phoebe,
" The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it back.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t want, but it turns out we do.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, that’s not fair! A person’s wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn’t have a graduation party! And I didn’t go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me” or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.( She storms out)",,,,,Phoebe,
 (Lightly) Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. (thinks for a few",,,,,Phoebe,
" Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.",,,,,Phoebe,
" And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't shot",,,,,Phoebe,
 (to the Charity guy) We're back!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. (she gives the check and pulls it back again) No... Oh God... Oh!",,,,,Phoebe,
 But... but... but we're giving you this!,,,,,Phoebe,
" (looks at the amount on the check, and gasps) Well, this is very generous!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, is that you?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You're not making the pies yourself?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey Rach.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What's Emma doing today?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (sarcastic) Oh... okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I was thinking...",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. (she looks around) It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (panicking) But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why not!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No, we're late!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!",,,,,Phoebe,
 And it looks like she put makeup on her!,,,,,Phoebe,
" You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, what are we gonna say?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!",,,,,Phoebe,
" We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! (Others start to agree but she continues) OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? (She places her hand over his ""fire"" and mimics a bursting water balloon, thus putting the fire out).",,,,,Phoebe,
 It's locked.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What are we gonna do? I'm starving.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.",,,,,Phoebe,
 So bad.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with Emma's trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica).",,,,,Phoebe,
" Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I'll pull you through.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I know. Have you considered pageanting?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, right! Your adoption interview!",,,,,Phoebe,
 What are you gonna name the baby?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Mandy.,,,,,Phoebe,
 No.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Fine, I'll give you her number.",,,,,Phoebe,
 SARAH!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What are you talking about? Sarah's great!,,,,,Phoebe,
" That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!",,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (to Rachel) Oh,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...,,,,,Phoebe,
 What? You know about the plate thing?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (to Joey) You wouldn’t let her have a grape?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (to Ross) This place is awesome!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What? They will be!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?",,,,,Phoebe,
" oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.",,,,,Phoebe,
" If you had to, what would you give up, food or s*x?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ross, how about you. What would you give up, s*x or food?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, how about... uhm... s*x or dinosaurs?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, how cute!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, she looks just like a little doll!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! (looking outside the window) Look, there's Chandler. (he's on the street, talking to a woman)",,,,,Phoebe,
 OH! He's having an affair.,,,,,Phoebe,
" You know, I'm always right about these things.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! (looking outside) See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah? Well, let's see. (she takes her mobile phone) Ok, duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. Phoebe calls Chandler)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so...(back to Central Perk) ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (shocked) Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either ""Liar, Liar"" or ""Betrayal"", or... ""An Affair To Remember"".",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...",,,,,Phoebe,
 (glancing at her) What?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (to Chandler at the phone) Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (patting her bag) I got them!,,,,,Phoebe,
" So, should we tell her?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Why? Who’d you seen him with?,,,,,Phoebe,
 TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!,,,,,Phoebe,
" All right. (she releases him). He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 They went in together. So sorry.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Why do you have a realtor?,,,,,Phoebe,
 So you're gonna move?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, but so is this.",,,,,Phoebe,
" You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?",,,,,Phoebe,
" [looking outside the window] Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.",,,,,Phoebe,
 You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!,,,,,Phoebe,
 What else?,,,,,Phoebe,
 That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (to Monica) You're gonna be okay?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store. (she got earrings),,,,,Phoebe,
 Great!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (to Rachel) Thank you so much for this.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting?",,,,,Phoebe,
" You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. (she drinks her tea) Hmmmm... raunchy!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (Excited, running back to her seat) Oh!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, God!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Rachel?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Are you kidding?,,,,,Phoebe,
 How old is your phonebook?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!",,,,,Phoebe,
 This is how I look when I'm turned on!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Shocking!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! (turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper)",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?",,,,,Phoebe,
" You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.",,,,,Phoebe,
" There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (after a pause) Finish it!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Your last dance. Do it for us.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh this is so ho-o-ot!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, no, no, don't stop!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, hey Joey.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...",,,,,Phoebe,
 So... what do you say?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (her mobile phone rings) Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! (she answers) Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I don't care, so you pick!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ok.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.,,,,,Phoebe,
 She did? Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (looking angry) Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Rehearse it!,,,,,Phoebe,
 So Rach.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Where is Emma?,,,,,Phoebe,
 What's up?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.",,,,,Phoebe,
" I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!,,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't have a fax machine.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I decided to pee.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's (Rachel is walking by). Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. (she reads a note). My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... (Monica is twirling her hands in order to make Phoebe speed up her speech) oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... (Monica is tapping her watch with her finger) it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and (Monica clears her throat) but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...",,,,,Phoebe,
" And... moment's over! (Rachel, Joey and Chandler all turn and look disapprovingly towards Monica but she just shrugs it off) So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... (she's flipping cards skipping half of them) Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I (Monica is miming CUT). Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS (she mimes Monica's when she was twirling her hands) OR THIS (she taps her watch) OR THIS (she mimes CUT) OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! (pause) You know what? You're done.",,,,,Phoebe,
" YOU'RE FIRED! (mimes the CUT again) (pause and she raises her glass) Cheers! (Chandler raises his, smiling and Monica stares at him and he puts down his glass.)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, happy my wedding day to you!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wow, this is a lot!",,,,,Phoebe,
 You won awards?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word ""lorkins"" what flowers would that be?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!,,,,,Phoebe,
" No! We're gonna do it my way. (listens) Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. (switches calls) Hello?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh my God, what's it doing here?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (starting to panic) Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?",,,,,Phoebe,
 (to Monica) Help me.,,,,,Phoebe,
 I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (Nearly in tears) Please?,,,,,Phoebe,
 More than I wanna get married.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (sounds scared already) About what?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I know.,,,,,Phoebe,
 What?,,,,,Phoebe,
 (Turning to Mike) What do you think?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Me too! (turning to Monica) Monica, do you think we could do it?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, okay. Hi new dad. (Chandler waves)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, thank you.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I love you guys.,,,,,Phoebe,
 (nervously) Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh wait, oh no. Wait.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I don't care... I'll be my something blue.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Thank you.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Na-ah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family. (She puts the ring on Mikes finger)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I do.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I got married! (everyone applauds) Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, why? What's up?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oui, bien sur je parle Français! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is ""My name is Claude"", so, just repeat after me. ""Je m'appelle Claude"".",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, just... let's try it again.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Je m'appelle Claude.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh. It's not... quite what I'm saying.,,,,,Phoebe,
" It does, really?",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, let just try it again. Really listen.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (slowly) Je m'appelle Claude.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, mon Dieu!",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hi!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Je m'appelle Claude.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. ""je"".",,,,,Phoebe,
 m'ap,,,,,Phoebe,
 pelle,,,,,Phoebe,
" Great, ok faster! ""je""",,,,,Phoebe,
 m'ap,,,,,Phoebe,
 pelle,,,,,Phoebe,
 Je m'appelle!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!",,,,,Phoebe,
" I, I have to go before I put your head through a wall. (she leaves)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey Joey.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Really, can I hear some of it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, you're not, (she tries to smile and contain her anger, but loses it) You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!",,,,,Phoebe,
 How could you possibly think that?,,,,,Phoebe,
" (in a French accent) Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Reginé Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estée Lauder.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Écoutez, je vais vous dire la vérité. C'est mon petit frère. Il est un peu retardé. (Translation: Listen, I will tell you the truth. He's my little bother. He's a bit retarded.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui... (Translation: So, would you please just humor him?)",,,,,Phoebe,
" (to the director) Merci. Au revoir. (Translation: Thanks, goodbye.)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, can you really tapdance?",,,,,Phoebe,
 It's off the resumé. (she strikes it through with a pencil),,,,,Phoebe,
 Archery?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Horseback riding?,,,,,Phoebe,
 You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ready... GO!,,,,,Phoebe,
 (checking her watch) You did it!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Wow!,,,,,Phoebe,
" I do, he's been working on that all day! (looking at Joey)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Where did you go to do it?,,,,,Phoebe,
" Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.",,,,,Phoebe,
" What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Good for you. That was really mature.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...",,,,,Phoebe,
" All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.",,,,,Phoebe,
 (to the woman behind her) This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. (she turns around and the clerk behind the counter heard her.) But you obviously haven't.,,,,,Phoebe,
" I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. (the clerk shows no change in expression whatsoever) You're fun.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, not anything, I mean...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, this could take a while.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Okay.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh! Princess Consuela.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Uh-huh!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.",,,,,Phoebe,
" What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Ross...,,,,,Phoebe,
 Can you?,,,,,Phoebe,
" And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything. (Rachel mouths ""aah"")",,,,,Phoebe,
 Oh God!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Welcome back!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh, me too!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock! (She smiles from ear to ear),,,,,Phoebe,
 Nope.,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yep.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?",,,,,Phoebe,
(not amused) Mike Crap Bag?,,,,,Phoebe,
" You're not serious, right?",,,,,Phoebe,
" Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it.",,,,,Phoebe,
 And I love Crap.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Thank you, mister Bag.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Oh hi Rita! Good! (to Mike) Oh, Rita's a massage client.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (shrugs) Er, Rita, this is my husband.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (without moving her lips, wearing a fake smile) Okay, I will. (to Rita) This is my husband Crap Bag.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?",,,,,Phoebe,
 How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.,,,,,Phoebe,
 It's a funny word.,,,,,Phoebe,
 ...Oh crap!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Ooh, what's going on?",,,,,Phoebe,
 Good for you!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Of course we can. Congratulations. (they hug, but Joey shakes his head.) Yay! (she gestures Joey to come and join in) Joey...",,,,,Phoebe,
 You okay with this?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Talking to Ross.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?",,,,,Phoebe,
 She died.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic. (Chandler and Monica look puzzled) Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, she was just an agent.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey. Everything ok?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Estelle? Why?,,,,,Phoebe,
 I’m guessing she does.,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.",,,,,Phoebe,
 Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. (she leaves),,,,,Phoebe,
" Man, tough week for Estelle!",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.",,,,,Phoebe,
" No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you (Joey considers it)",,,,,Phoebe,
 Because patience is the road to understanding (she thinks) which ... is the key... to a happy heart.,,,,,Phoebe,
" (picking up her bag) All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?",,,,,Phoebe,
" (on the other side of the line, still pretending to be Estelle) Joey, it's Estelle. (Joey's eyes bulge up, he looks afraid)",,,,,Phoebe,
" Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...",,,,,Phoebe,
" Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.",,,,,Phoebe,
" (Looks around) It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.",,,,,Phoebe,
 WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Hey.,Joey,,,,Phoebe,
 Yeah! (they leave),,,,,Phoebe,
" Joey, it’s Estelle.",,,,,Phoebe,
 oh! Now it’s a party!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Gay, go.",,,,,Phoebe,
" Hey, check this out! It’s totally you!",,,,,Phoebe,
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Ewww!!!,,,,,Phoebe,

" Yes, we should. I think we should.",,,,,Phoebe,Rachel
 What about my children Drake?! Huh!? (She starts running around on the set with a security guy chasing her) No!! No!! No! God!,,,,,Phoebe,
 Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! (SHE IS PUSHED DOWN THE STAIRS. THEY CHEER),Joey,Ross,Chandler,,Phoebe,
" It’s a little coincidental, but believable. (Joey nods in agreement). Listen, I’m sure you’re wondering why I didn’t get you an audition for that TV movie.",,,,,Phoebe,
 I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!,,,,,Phoebe,
" Don’t take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?",,,,,Phoebe,
 What are you saying?,,,,,Phoebe,
 Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.,,,Chandler,,,
 Yes and you talked to her...,,,,,,Rachel
 Come on! You guys can pee standing up.,,,,,,Rachel
 [waitressing] Does anybody want anything else?,,,,,,Rachel
 It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of ""You'll never make it on your own"".",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.",,,,,,Rachel
 Who?,,,,,,Rachel
 Don't you have a laundry room in your building?,,,,,,Rachel
 Sure.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.",,,,,,Rachel
 But I saved it. I put my basket on top.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, but, there were no suds.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you know, no suds, no save.",,,,,,Rachel
 That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.,,,,,,Rachel
 What's that?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.",,,,,,Rachel
" [holds a pair of panties in front of Ross] Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.",,,,,,Rachel
 What uh-oh?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, what's the matter?",,,,,,Rachel
" Come on, show me.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, everything's pink.",,,,,,Rachel
" Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.",,,,,,Rachel
" Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.",,,,,,Rachel
" I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!",,,,,,Rachel
 [to Ross] Yes! Did you see that?,,,,,,Rachel
 I could not have done this without you.,,,,,,Rachel
 Are you sure?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, are you sure you're ok?",,,,,,Rachel
 Does it still hurt?,,,,,,Rachel
 Where's Chandler?,,,,,,Rachel
" Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.",,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!",,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, you guys, this is big.",,,,,,Rachel
 That had to hurt!,,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, somebody.",,,,,,Rachel
 Um... Ross?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh come on, I already went.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... [sigh]... oh, the foot of the bed.",,,,,,Rachel
" I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.",,,,,,Rachel
" There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.",,,,,,Rachel
" I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah right.,,,,,,Rachel
 [sigh] OK.,,,,,,Rachel
 You don't.,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
 You do?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]",,,,,,Rachel
 What are you shushing?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ahhhh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Huh. [she agrees, but looks very confused]",,,,,,Rachel
 Hmmm... this is so nice.,,,,,,Rachel
 OK.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind Ross],,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross]",,,,,,Rachel
 During a blackout? He'd get trampled!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. [they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers] Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.",,,,,,Rachel
 Bob Buttons?,,,,,,Rachel
" Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...",,,,,,Rachel
" Wow. [she exhales in amazement, blowing the candle out]",,,,,,Rachel
" [entering with Paolo, arm in arm] Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.",,,,,,Rachel
 And Joey....,,,,,,Rachel
 And Ross.,,,,,,Rachel
 [proudly] He doesn't speak much English.,,,,,,Rachel
 Look at that!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh... Italy, I think.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.",,,,,,Rachel
 I have absolutely no idea.,,,,,,Rachel
" [to Monica and Phoebe] Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!",,,,,,Rachel
" God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.",,,,,,Rachel
" Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!,,,,,,Rachel
 ... the WENUS?,,,,,,Rachel
 [sarcastic] Oh. That WENUS.,,,,,,Rachel
" No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.",,,,,,Rachel
 Work counselor?,,,,,,Rachel
 I don't!,,,,,,Rachel
 The meeting with the guy went great?,,,,,,Rachel
 What are you going to make?,,,,,,Rachel
" [pause] And Monica, what are you going to make?",,,,,,Rachel
" [trying to sound like a bug] Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
 So what are you guys going to do?,,,,,,Rachel
 My God! What happened to you?,,,,,,Rachel
" [comes up and rubs him on the chest] Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!",,,,,,Rachel
 Ten dollars an hour for what?,,,,,,Rachel
 [hurt] Waitressing?,,,,,,Rachel
" But, but?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.,,,,,,Rachel
 Who was that?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. [she walks away towards the door],,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
" Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.",,,,,,Rachel
 Done.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?,,,,,,Rachel
 What's up?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.",,,,,,Rachel
 No. Let me get you some wine!,,,,,,Rachel
 Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?,,,,,,Rachel
 You don't want to work for a guy like that.,,,,,,Rachel
" Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.",,,,,,Rachel
" What, it's ok when Chandler does it?",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.",,,,,,Rachel
" And if you need anything else, I--[notices the handsome Dr. Franzblau]--do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that's funny!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, why?",,,,,,Rachel
" No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?",,,,,,Rachel
 Ok?,,,,,,Rachel
" [to Dr. Franzblau] Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.",,,,,,Rachel
" [anxiously] No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?",,,,,,Rachel
" Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
 I'm a waitress.,,,,,,Rachel
 [getting the point] Yeah. Gotcha.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ok. That's fine. [takes her earrings out],,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I know. Look at him.",,,,,,Rachel
 You guys wanna get some coffee?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, let me see! [grabs picture] Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!",,,,,,Rachel
 Pardon?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. [walks into living room]",,,,,,Rachel
" OK, I'm guessing this is from...",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, thank you, Melanie.",,,,,,Rachel
" [picks it up] OK... ah, it's light... [shakes it]...it rattles... it's... [opens it] Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! [she gives it back to him]",,,,,,Rachel
 This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And...[opens it]...it's a book!,,,,,,Rachel
 Who's this from?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh... [opens it]... [sees it is a pin] Oh my God. He remembered.,,,,,,Rachel
" It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!",,,,,,Rachel
 What did you just say?,,,,,,Rachel
" No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.... my God.,,,,,,Rachel
" I mean, this is unbelievable.",,,,,,Rachel
" No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... [to Joey]: W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. [gets up to leave]",,,,,,Rachel
 I-I-I don't know.,,,,,,Rachel
 I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.,,,,,,Rachel
" Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later. [opens door]",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I know, but I--he just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...",,,,,,Rachel
" OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.",,,,,,Rachel
 Uh... I don't know.,,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.",,,,,,Rachel
 [confused] Huh?,,,,,,Rachel
 I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.,,,,,,Rachel
 No!,,,,,,Rachel
" No, I'm just....",,,,,,Rachel
 Wha--,,,,,,Rachel
 No! There is.. there is noone else!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this--this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.",,,,,,Rachel
" Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna--",,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...",,,,,,Rachel
 Who is it?,,,,,,Rachel
 C'mon up.,,,,,,Rachel
" Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.",,,,,,Rachel
 So I'm thinking about you. So what?,,,,,,Rachel
 Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, it's too hard.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, you're like my best friend.",,,,,,Rachel
" If we broke up, and I lost you...",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?",,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow.,,,,,,Rachel
 Right! You're right!,,,,,,Rachel
 You know what?,,,,,,Rachel
" I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... [gives him her drink] I mean--I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
" [sifting through crowd] Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.",,,,,,Rachel
" So, how was the party?",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?",,,,,,Rachel
" What? [looks, feigns indifference] C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.",,,,,,Rachel
 Together?,,,,,,Rachel
 Both of you?,,,,,,Rachel
 Together.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well. [looks at watch] Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. [she leaves carrying her tray then comes back in] OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.",,,,,,Rachel
 [distracted] How long do cats live?,,,,,,Rachel
" Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?",,,,,,Rachel
 That's just great. [she picks up her champagne and starts drinking],,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, right, clink. [downs her glass]",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.",,,,,,Rachel
 I mean he just started going out with her.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you. ",,,,,,Rachel
" OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?",,,,,,Rachel
" [obviously drunk] I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? [belligerently] What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes! Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you're not having fun, are you?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?",,,,,,Rachel
" Closure, that's what it is. Closure. [she looks around the restaurant, spotting a guy with a cellular phone] Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo [she almost falls out of her chair]",,,,,,Rachel
" Hello, excuse me.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.",,,,,,Rachel
" I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. [man is still reluctant] OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you. OK. [dials] [to Michael] Machine. Just waiting for the beep.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ahhhh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .",,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.",,,,,,Rachel
 Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?,,,,,,Rachel
 Huh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, go ahead. [Rachel walks in her room. Ross picks up the phone and dials his machine to check his messages.]",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . [jumps the couch and lands on Ross's back, finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expression on his face.]",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohhhhhhhh God. [climbs off his back],,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, ohh.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.",,,,,,Rachel
 Chandler told me.,,,,,,Rachel
 When you were in China.,,,,,,Rachel
 Meeting Julie.,,,,,,Rachel
 Are you over me?,,,,,,Rachel
" Wait, so, you're going?",,,,,,Rachel
" OK, OK.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that's um, interesting.",,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, I got it Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
 [hurt] What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?",,,,,,Rachel
 I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.,,,,,,Rachel
" Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?",,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.,,,,,,Rachel
 Good. [Ross leaves],,,,,,Rachel
" And ya know what, now I've got closure.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ross kissed me.,,,,,,Rachel
 It was unbelievable!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it ended very well.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.",,,,,,Rachel
" [to Ross] Hey, you.",,,,,,Rachel
 Good. How are you?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Did uh, Ross call?",,,,,,Rachel
" Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, ""Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together.""",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my god.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, do you guys have...[sees Ross, pauses]...hi.",,,,,,Rachel
 [sees his coat on] Where you goin'?,,,,,,Rachel
 [dejected] Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, god.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.",,,,,,Rachel
 Let me get my coat.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. [notices Chandler's computer screen] What's that?",,,,,,Rachel
 What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?,,,,,,Rachel
 Well what is it? Let me see.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.",,,,,,Rachel
 And I'm in it? Then let me read it.,,,,,,Rachel
 Come on.,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it. [Rachel grabs the paper and runs across the room, reading it to herself.]",,,,,,Rachel
" What is this? Ross, what is this?",,,,,,Rachel
 Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?,,,,,,Rachel
 Just a waitress?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!,,,,,,Rachel
 She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.,,,,,,Rachel
" [coldly] When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.",,,,,,Rachel
 Not interested.,,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
 That's what I said.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.",,,,,,Rachel
" [near tears] No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. [to the others] I said don't go!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.",,,,,,Rachel
" [to Monica] Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.",,,,,,Rachel
" We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys. [walks over to table, holding five empty wine bottles]",,,,,,Rachel
 I had one glass.,,,,,,Rachel
" OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake. [Phoebe and Rachel go to counter.]",,,,,,Rachel
" Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.",,,,,,Rachel
 What? What is so strange about me having a date?,,,,,,Rachel
" Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.",,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
" Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.",,,,,,Rachel
 What's the matter?,,,,,,Rachel
" What, isn't he sober?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohhh, OK.",,,,,,Rachel
 Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
 Uhh.... waitressing?,,,,,,Rachel
" [looks at him] Huh, Bob Saget?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, we're not seeing each other, so....",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, yeah, this is the deal.",,,,,,Rachel
" Um, Russ, you ready?",,,,,,Rachel
 Bye.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.",,,,,,Rachel
 Steve... sleeve!,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww! [turns away]",,,,,,Rachel
 Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?,,,,,,Rachel
 I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?,,,,,,Rachel
 Why would I have to sleep with you?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God, even his knock is boring.",,,,,,Rachel
 What happened?,,,,,,Rachel
 How is it going with Charlie?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, sure!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (TO WAITRESS, WHO HAS BROUGHT HER COFFEE)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realised that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, he always looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (TO MONICA) So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...",,,,,,Rachel
" (ON PHONE) Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! ",,,,,,Rachel
" C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!",,,,,,Rachel
" Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. ",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!",,,,,,Rachel
 I'm all better now.,,,,,,Rachel
" Please, no, go, that'd be fine!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight..",,,,,,Rachel
" Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (STOPS TALKING; DIALS A NUMBER ON THE PHONE) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh...see... but Joanie loved Chachi! That's the difference!,,,,,,Rachel
" Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hello, Paul.",,,,,,Rachel
" So, like, you guys all have jobs?",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?,,,,,,Rachel
 I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh wow. Are you in trouble.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, look, wish me luck!",,,,,,Rachel
 I'm gonna go get one of those job things.,,,,,,Rachel
 Guess what?,,,,,,Rachel
 Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.,,,,,,Rachel
" You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!",,,,,,Rachel
" They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, credit card.",,,,,,Rachel
 Um... my... father.,,,,,,Rachel
 I know that. That's why I was getting married.,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
 I don't think so.,,,,,,Rachel
 (TO ROSS) You gonna crash on the couch?,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (MON SMILES) What?",,,,,,Rachel
 Sorry-,,,,,,Rachel
" No, you have it, really, I don't want it-",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 I knew.,,,,,,Rachel
 I did.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, maybe...",,,,,,Rachel
 Goodnight.,,,,,,Rachel
 (WALKS UP WITH A POT OF COFFEE) Would anybody like more coffee?,,,,,,Rachel
 I'm just serving it.,,,,,,Rachel
 Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.",,,,,,Rachel
 Has anybody seen my engagement ring?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (LOOKING UNDER CUSHIONS)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...",,,,,,Rachel
" I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...",,,,,,Rachel
" (LOOKING AT THE LASAGNE AND REALISING) Ohhhhh, don't be mad...",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I am sorry...",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?",,,,,,Rachel
 So what are you gonna do?,,,,,,Rachel
 You're twins?,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (THEY START TO LEAVE)",,,,,,Rachel
" The lights, please.. (JOEY TURNS OFF THE LIGHT. EXIT ALL BUT RACHEL AND ROSS. RACHEL STARTS TO SWEEP, THEN ROSS COMES BACK FROM THE TOILET)",,,,,,Rachel
 I'm just cleaning up.,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (SHE HANDS HIM THE BROOM AND THEN SITS DOWN)",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.. a little..,,,,,,Rachel
 A lot.,,,,,,Rachel
" So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?",,,,,,Rachel
 Remember when we were in high school together?,,,,,,Rachel
" I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (ROSS GAZES AT HER) ..Ross?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (SHE LEANS BACK ONTO HIS HAND)",,,,,,Rachel
 Barry?,,,,,,Rachel
 (HESITATES) Are you sure?,,,,,,Rachel
 I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great! ,,,,,,Rachel
 I dumped him.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, not much. I-I got a job.",,,,,,Rachel
 Why are- why are you so tanned?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?,,,,,,Rachel
" Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Well, um.. (GRABBING HIS FOREHEAD) You've got plugs!",,,,,,Rachel
 And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay..,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Anyway, um, (GETS THE RING OUT OF HER PURSE) I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me. ",,,,,,Rachel
" (ON PHONE) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. (SLAMS DOWN PHONE) (TO THE GANG, WHO ARE STARING) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel SO much better now.",,,,,,Rachel
" What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?",,,,,,Rachel
 Since when?,,,,,,Rachel
 And everybody knows this?,,,,,,Rachel
" (BRINGING DRINKS) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! (HANDING THEM OUT) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!",,,,,,Rachel
 (LEAVING TO SERVE OTHERS) Good for me!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, what are you doing?",,,,,,Rachel
 This Alan again? How's it goin'?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, then can we meet him?",,,,,,Rachel
 What bank is this?,,,,,,Rachel
 And did you notice...? (SPREADS HER THUMB AND INDEX FINGER),,,,,,Rachel
" What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.",,,,,,Rachel
" I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.",,,,,,Rachel
 It's worse than the thumb!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I-I could live without it.",,,,,,Rachel
" ""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.",,,,,,Rachel
" (WITH PHONE) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.",,,,,,Rachel
" (TO ROSS, WHO HAS WANDERED UP) God, he's good.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. ,,,,,,Rachel
 I think he's across the hall.,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, Joey..",,,,,,Rachel
 We didn't change..,,,,,,Rachel
" (TEARFUL) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-",,,,,,Rachel
 Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.,,,,,,Rachel
" See, there's always one guy. (MOCKING) ""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes.""",,,,,,Rachel
" Look look look look look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! ",,,,,,Rachel
" God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally- (OPENS ENVELOPE) -not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God! (RACHEL, LESLIE, KIKI AND JOANNE ALL SCREAM AND HUG EACH OTHER)",,,,,,Rachel
 What are you guys doing here?,,,,,,Rachel
" (TO (PREGNANT) LESLIE) Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!",,,,,,Rachel
 (TO JOANNE) So what's going on with you?,,,,,,Rachel
" So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" What? Guys, I'm not. ",,,,,,Rachel
 I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.",,,,,,Rachel
 What's that?,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. (GRABS THE BLENDER AND STARTS TO DRINK),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, God, ask them what they want.",,,,,,Rachel
 But I haven't used my card in weeks!,,,,,,Rachel
" They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?",,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, c'mon! (MISERABLY) Let's play Twister!",,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?",,,,,,Rachel
 ...Jack from downstairs?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-",,,,,,Rachel
" But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like-",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. ,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together? ",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?",,,,,,Rachel
" I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank God. Food. (SHE GOES TO GET IT),,,,,,Rachel
" (MISERABLE) No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hello? Who are we spying on?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh please, they're having s*x.",,,,,,Rachel
" So, whaddya think George is like?",,,,,,Rachel
 How long?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (SHE SITS UP AND THE CUSHION SHE WAS LEANING AGAINST FALLS OFF THE BALCONY) Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? (TO PHOEBE) She was a big girl.,,,,,,Rachel
 I was laughing! You made me laugh! (MONICA AND RACHEL START TO SQUABBLE),,,,,,Rachel
 He is so cute!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, okay. Will you take my place?",,,,,,Rachel
" Nooo! (TAKES THE PHONE; CHANDLER TAKES HER PLACE) Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.",,,,,,Rachel
 I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohhh... I'm fine.,,,,,,Rachel
" (READING THE PROGRAMME) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!",,,,,,Rachel
 God. I feel violated.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!",,,,,,Rachel
 What is it?,,,,,,Rachel
 Tah-daaah!,,,,,,Rachel
" Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, whaddya think?",,,,,,Rachel
" I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.",,,,,,Rachel
" ..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?",,,,,,Rachel
 Who is being loud?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?",,,,,,Rachel
 Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?,,,,,,Rachel
" Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be... ",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God! Calling from Rome! [Takes phone] Bon giorno, caro mio. ",,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. [Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler] I'm talking to Rome.",,,,,,Rachel
" [Exasperated] Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.",,,,,,Rachel
" So, um, did she...",,,,,,Rachel
" Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? [Gives her a pencil]",,,,,,Rachel
 Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you-you mean your earrings?",,,,,,Rachel
 [Sticking her foot out]Hm-m.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!,,,,,,Rachel
" [Humouring him] Oh, well you know who I love the most?",,,,,,Rachel
 You!,,,,,,Rachel
" [Still trapped under Ross] Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, who's this little naked guy?",,,,,,Rachel
" Aww, look at the little thing.",,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?",,,,,,Rachel
" Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?",,,,,,Rachel
" It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? (everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. (picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go.",,,,,,Rachel
" Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.",,,,,,Rachel
" Thanks, you can just put it on the table.",,,,,,Rachel
" Thanks, you can just put it on the table.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you. Thank you so much!,,,,,,Rachel
" Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my god.,,,,,,Rachel
 Saw what?,,,,,,Rachel
" I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!",,,,,,Rachel
" I can't, I gotta go.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ok.,,,,,,Rachel
 I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.,,,,,,Rachel
 We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys.""",,,,,,Rachel
" No, no, no, you said, ""got the keys"".",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I gotta get my ticket!",,,,,,Rachel
" (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.",,,,,,Rachel
 Aside from the fact that you said you had them?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you should have.",,,,,,Rachel
 Because!,,,,,,Rachel
 Because!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 By all means.,,,,,,Rachel
 And a crappy New Year.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? [They all protest and hit her with cushions] Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. ",,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, you're on.",,,,,,Rachel
" [Into microphone] Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!",,,,,,Rachel
" Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
" [Brings Joey a mug of coffee] Okay, here we go...",,,,,,Rachel
 [Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee] There. Now there is.,,,,,,Rachel
 Five.,,,,,,Rachel
 Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.",,,,,,Rachel
 Rome. Jerk missed his flight.,,,,,,Rachel
" No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? [To Monica] Are people eating my dip?",,,,,,Rachel
" Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.",,,,,,Rachel
 The bll is drrbing!,,,,,,Rachel
 I can't kiss anyone.,,,,,,Rachel
 ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! (Turns on the TV)",,,,,,Rachel
" No way, forget it.",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hi sweetie. (They kiss)",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.",,,,,,Rachel
" Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
 What're you guys doing out here?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well,sounds like you two have issues.",,,,,,Rachel
" Goodbye, baby.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!,,,,,,Rachel
 (Into microphone) Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.,,,,,,Rachel
" (Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.",,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...",,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos (touching Paolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.",,,,,,Rachel
 I know...,,,,,,Rachel
" I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...",,,,,,Rachel
" (to Ross) I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....",,,,,,Rachel
 Pheebs!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, right, that's me!",,,,,,Rachel
" ""Ooo,"" what?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi Pheebs!,,,,,,Rachel
" No, these aren't all my suitcases. (picks up small blue suitcase and shows to Phoebe) This one's Paolo's.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...",,,,,,Rachel
" (taking cookie) Ok, thanks Pheebs (takes bite of cookie, overwhelmed) Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.",,,,,,Rachel
 I guess you don't.,,,,,,Rachel
 I need some milk.,,,,,,Rachel
" No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all ""Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..."" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!",,,,,,Rachel
" Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!",,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know...right, he's the pig!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, God, he's such a pig,",,,,,,Rachel
 He's like a big disgusting...,,,,,,Rachel
 ...pig...pig man!,,,,,,Rachel
" (voice wavers) Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, Ok, Pheebs...",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, God...",,,,,,Rachel
" No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, I've been better...",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Ross...",,,,,,Rachel
" I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. (Ross crosses arms)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Ross, you're so great!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh...,,,,,,Rachel
 ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?,,,,,,Rachel
" No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.",,,,,,Rachel
" That is IT! You just barge in here, you don't knock-",,,,,,Rachel
 -You have no respect for anybody's privacy-,,,,,,Rachel
" No, you wait! This is ridiculous!",,,,,,Rachel
 What? What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!!,,,,,,Rachel
 He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okaaay. [To the guys, on the couch] Any of you guys want anything else?",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.",,,,,,Rachel
" Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? [She walks over near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest] Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... [Notices Chandler] Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?",,,,,,Rachel
 Did you not get a good enough look the other day?,,,,,,Rachel
" C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.",,,,,,Rachel
" You're right! I mean- you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and- and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. ",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, I'm Rachel.",,,,,,Rachel
 Bathroom's up there.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?",,,,,,Rachel
" Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's pee-pee time. [She goes into Joey and Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Trib is reading the paper] Hey, Mr. Trib. ",,,,,,Rachel
 Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.,,,,,,Rachel
 I thought it was Chandler!,,,,,,Rachel
 You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!,,,,,,Rachel
 We hate that guy.,,,,,,Rachel
 We're sorry.,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow.,,,,,,Rachel
" Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.",,,,,,Rachel
 What happened?,,,,,,Rachel
" Do what, do what?",,,,,,Rachel
 No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.",,,,,,Rachel
" Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had s*x. [imitating] ""Was it good for you?""",,,,,,Rachel
 How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.",,,,,,Rachel
 Or?,,,,,,Rachel
" Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my god. Janice, hi!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Joey, look who it is.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.",,,,,,Rachel
" [tossing things in the fire] Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.",,,,,,Rachel
 [looking at picture] Hey he's wearing a sweater.,,,,,,Rachel
 And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
" So, um, will you bring the truck?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, my god.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, they're firemen guys.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah, I've done that.",,,,,,Rachel
 I've never done that.,,,,,,Rachel
" Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don't get along?",,,,,,Rachel
" So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, isn't that gonna be weird?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, cool. ""Urkel"" in Spanish is ""Urkel"".",,,,,,Rachel
" Well someone was supposed to write ""Rache, take down the lights"" and put it on the refrigerator. How long has that been there?",,,,,,Rachel
" So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?",,,,,,Rachel
 Ok. Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating. Sweetheart, you're fired, but how 'bout a quickie before I go to work.",,,,,,Rachel
 You don't even have cats.,,,,,,Rachel
 We'll try to keep it down.,,,,,,Rachel
 Are you seein' her again tonight?,,,,,,Rachel
 It's just occurring to you?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you're gonna be great!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, how'd she take it?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he's going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?",,,,,,Rachel
" Please, they've been going out a week. They haven't even slept together yet, I mean, that's not serious.",,,,,,Rachel
" No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so I'm takin' 'em down. Ok? Whoa! (She falls off the balcony)",,,,,,Rachel
" I'm ok! I'm ok! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?",,,,,,Rachel
 Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.,,,,,,Rachel
 You.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that. Monica: You don't have insurance?",,,,,,Rachel
" Why, how much is this gonna cost?",,,,,,Rachel
 Well what are we gonna do?,,,,,,Rachel
" Um, unless, unless I use yours.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, now, wait a second. Who did I just put as my ""In case of emergency"" call person?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, all right, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow!",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you. Thank you. I love you.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, this is my friend Rachel.",,,,,,Rachel
 Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?,,,,,,Rachel
" I meant young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh, Good Rach.",,,,,,Rachel
 Right.,,,,,,Rachel
" So, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.",,,,,,Rachel
" Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said yes.",,,,,,Rachel
" What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!",,,,,,Rachel
 Was that the cake?,,,,,,Rachel
 I hope it's ok.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, coming!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that's great. Look at that.",,,,,,Rachel
" You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you. Well, listen, why don't you two sit down, and we'll get you some glasses....STAT.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are. I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine, I really do.",,,,,,Rachel
 Would you stop being such a wuss?,,,,,,Rachel
 I am not a baby. You know what?,,,,,,Rachel
 You know what?,,,,,,Rachel
" Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.",,,,,,Rachel
" I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, I'm a uh, chef at a restaurant uptown.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah it is. Mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.",,,,,,Rachel
" And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow.",,,,,,Rachel
 I use my breasts to get other people's attention.,,,,,,Rachel
" Daddy, daddy, why? Why would I sleep with Billy Drestin? His father tried to put you out of business! You are dead!",,,,,,Rachel
" Hello? Uh, yeah, uh, hold on a second. Let me see if she's here. It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. Oh, god, what do we do, what do we do?",,,,,,Rachel
" No, you do it.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" You were right, this was just not worth it.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, let me just change.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, remember us?",,,,,,Rachel
 And I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.,,,,,,Rachel
 I know. I'm just not that bright either.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...'",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh... yeah, why?",,,,,,Rachel
" [upset] Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? [to Monica, quietly]: Did you bring the mail?",,,,,,Rachel
" [to Monica]: Really? [out loud]: Sure, we have scones left! [to Monica]: OK, read them to me.",,,,,,Rachel
 [out loud]: We have apple cinnamon...,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 [grabs the bill] Give me that!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi! How are you?,,,,,,Rachel
 OK. [walks away],,,,,,Rachel
" Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?",,,,,,Rachel
 Really.,,,,,,Rachel
 But you could teach us.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, good for you!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! [gives it to Phoebe] Ross: No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, no no no no no no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.",,,,,,Rachel
" OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... [gets up to leave]",,,,,,Rachel
 Settle what?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh. Right.,,,,,,Rachel
" [to Ross]: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.",,,,,,Rachel
 [opening mail] Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oooooh. [reads letter] [surprised]: Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!,,,,,,Rachel
 [in disbelief]: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.,,,,,,Rachel
 Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!,,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
 Why?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!",,,,,,Rachel
" Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and--oh, I went to camp with her cousin... and, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story--",,,,,,Rachel
" No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.",,,,,,Rachel
" Alright... [shuffles cards expertly, all the guys stare in amazement]",,,,,,Rachel
" Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a pen1s. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women. [hands over her money]",,,,,,Rachel
" Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no no no no no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.",,,,,,Rachel
" Your fly is open, Geller. [he checks it, and zips up]",,,,,,Rachel
 I'm in.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! [lays down cards] I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? [collects chips] I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. [holds up a chip] I think that one was Ross's, and I think--oh--that one was Ross's. Yes! [starts singing]: Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...",,,,,,Rachel
 And your fly's still open...,,,,,,Rachel
" Ha, I made you look....",,,,,,Rachel
 I couldn't be inner. Monica?,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. [throws chips in pot] What do you say... want to waste another buck?",,,,,,Rachel
 I'm not telling. [collects chips],,,,,,Rachel
 No..!,,,,,,Rachel
 Get your hands out of there! No!,,,,,,Rachel
" [deals new hand] Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. [phone rings]",,,,,,Rachel
" [answering phone] Hel-lo, Rachel Green.",,,,,,Rachel
 [on phone]: Excuse me. [covers up phone; to Ross]: It's about the job.,,,,,,Rachel
" Barbara! Hi, how are you? [pause] Uh-huh. [pause] No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, plea--Hello? Hello? [hangs up phone, very depressed]",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah...[sigh]....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, we do. [pause]",,,,,,Rachel
 I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. [throws it in],,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?",,,,,,Rachel
 [to Ross]: Loser?,,,,,,Rachel
" What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?",,,,,,Rachel
 How many you want?,,,,,,Rachel
 Dealer takes two. [she deals herself two cards] What do you bet?,,,,,,Rachel
 OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. [throws it in],,,,,,Rachel
" See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.",,,,,,Rachel
" OK, then get me your purse.",,,,,,Rachel
" [to Monica]: Thank you. [to Ross]: I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.",,,,,,Rachel
 [lays down cards] Full house.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, time's up.",,,,,,Rachel
" OK, OK, it's my turn. [reads the answer]",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? [Guy shakes his head] Okay.",,,,,,Rachel
" Thank you. [Examines it] Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh. Right. ...Oh great.,,,,,,Rachel
" Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration'. Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!",,,,,,Rachel
 Barry who I almost.,,,,,,Rachel
" Mindy, my maid of. Oh!",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.",,,,,,Rachel
" No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw- animal- sexual-",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, how was the movie?",,,,,,Rachel
 [To Marcel] And I will see you tomorrow!,,,,,,Rachel
" Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- [Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe] Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? [Takes the shoe into the kitchen] Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! [She notices the newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut] Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. [She leaves the apartment holding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in] Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- [Looks down and notices he is missing] Marcel? Marc- [Notices the open door]",,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-",,,,,,Rachel
 I don't know. The left one.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.",,,,,,Rachel
" C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?",,,,,,Rachel
 Anybody wanna trade? Oh...,,,,,,Rachel
" [On the phone] Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... [Enter Ross] ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.",,,,,,Rachel
" Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.",,,,,,Rachel
 Y'know Marcel?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I know, I'm sorry-",,,,,,Rachel
" [Tearfully] Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- [Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it] Oh! Who is it?",,,,,,Rachel
 See? I've even called Animal Control!,,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?,,,,,,Rachel
" O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, thanks for coming.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! [Ross puts his arms around her and they act all sweetness and light]",,,,,,Rachel
 Turned out it was a hat.,,,,,,Rachel
 Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes!!,,,,,,Rachel
 None.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Marcel?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, you don't know that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. [Kicks the sign] Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ross.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ross.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ross!,,,,,,Rachel
 Then what's with all the bananas?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, c'mon, Luisa!",,,,,,Rachel
" Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!",,,,,,Rachel
" Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?",,,,,,Rachel
" Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your-",,,,,,Rachel
 That'd be good.,,,,,,Rachel
 Barry?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that is so sick.",,,,,,Rachel
" Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...",,,,,,Rachel
" Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...",,,,,,Rachel
" Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?",,,,,,Rachel
 Why?,,,,,,Rachel
" All right. All right all right all right all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow... Wow!,,,,,,Rachel
" I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, what about Mindy?",,,,,,Rachel
" No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?",,,,,,Rachel
" No. No no no no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me. ",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..",,,,,,Rachel
 I had a bra.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Pretty well, actually... (WANDERING INTO KITCHEN)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, do I?",,,,,,Rachel
 (LOW VOICE)....We ended up having s*x in his chair.,,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.",,,,,,Rachel
" Please. If she said to you, ""Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now"", what would you say? ",,,,,,Rachel
" Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... okay... great... great... all right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. okay... bye. (SITS DOWN HEAVILY) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... (DOES SO) Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!",,,,,,Rachel
 Get down?,,,,,,Rachel
" Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..",,,,,,Rachel
" And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..",,,,,,Rachel
" Right, I'll see you guys later...",,,,,,Rachel
 Mindy.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, you.... So, what's up?",,,,,,Rachel
 Sure we should... So.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Of course!,,,,,,Rachel
 Was that all you wanted to ask me?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohhhh!! (MINDY STARTS TO SOB) ...What? What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh sure it is!,,,,,,Rachel
" Um, what- what would make you think that?",,,,,,Rachel
" (DRAWS BACK) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.",,,,,,Rachel
 What? What's what you were afraid of?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh.. Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.",,,,,,Rachel
 (OFFERS HER ARM TO MINDY. SHE SNIFFS) Smell familiar?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I am so sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey. Got a second?,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, we are here to break up with you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?",,,,,,Rachel
 Even when we were having s*x in that chair?,,,,,,Rachel
 Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels GREAT.",,,,,,Rachel
" What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh God. ,,,,,,Rachel
 And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.",,,,,,Rachel
 You DON'T KNOW?,,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.",,,,,,Rachel
 [Out of shot] Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 You're not an artist.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.",,,,,,Rachel
" [Yawning] Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...",,,,,,Rachel
 [Yawning] Nooo...,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?",,,,,,Rachel
" Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.",,,,,,Rachel
 Which one do you think she is?,,,,,,Rachel
 What does she mean?,,,,,,Rachel
 She could be you.,,,,,,Rachel
 What? You just click when they click.,,,,,,Rachel
 Nope. We took her to lunch.,,,,,,Rachel
 No way. No way did you do this.,,,,,,Rachel
" Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. [Exits]",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, somebody will.",,,,,,Rachel
 Where the hell've you been?,,,,,,Rachel
 Are you drunk?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...",,,,,,Rachel
 Monica? Monica!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!",,,,,,Rachel
" Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" [Brings Marcel a teddy bear] Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the 'plane.",,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
 Shut up!,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you were pretty damnedy good.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.",,,,,,Rachel
 Get off.,,,,,,Rachel
 What are you playing with?,,,,,,Rachel
 Off to see young Ethan?,,,,,,Rachel
" Just a touch. Mon, I donīt understand. I mean, youīve been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.",,,,,,Rachel
 Could tonight be the Night?,,,,,,Rachel
" So, did you shave your legs?",,,,,,Rachel
 Aha!,,,,,,Rachel
" No, forget it.",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. [Camera fades to Ross, whoīs listening very carefully] Joey was there too.",,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, it was just the three of us.",,,,,,Rachel
" He, he, he. You know what?",,,,,,Rachel
 There were times when it wasnīt even me.,,,,,,Rachel
" Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?",,,,,,Rachel
 Ethan called again.,,,,,,Rachel
" I, I didnīt say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear.",,,,,,Rachel
 Where are you going?,,,,,,Rachel
" [understands that Monica and Ethan wanna be alone] Hey, did you guys check out those new handdryers in the bathroom?",,,,,,Rachel
 True story.,,,,,,Rachel
 Letīs dry īem again.,,,,,,Rachel
" [talks in her sleep] Oooooooooh. [Rachel strokes her hand over the pillow. Ross mimicks her silently] Oh, thatīs nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ross?,,,,,,Rachel
" You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just...",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 I donīt know where the phone is.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ross?,,,,,,Rachel
" What, so I canīt lokk nice? There might be doctors there.",,,,,,Rachel
" Rossy, Rossy.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Emergency! Excuse me!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. I wanna hear everything!",,,,,,Rachel
" These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.",,,,,,Rachel
" Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.",,,,,,Rachel
" You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!",,,,,,Rachel
" And the chicken poops in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.",,,,,,Rachel
" Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, sure.",,,,,,Rachel
 Did you talk to him?,,,,,,Rachel
" Then, no.",,,,,,Rachel
 Here's your lemonade.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. Well than, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Go go go go, come on! Well, what did you find out?",,,,,,Rachel
" Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.",,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.",,,,,,Rachel
 At his apartment. Is this juice?,,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I know I'm a pathetic loser.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?",,,,,,Rachel
 I'm glad it's not a problem.,,,,,,Rachel
 How is she?,,,,,,Rachel
 I'm ok.,,,,,,Rachel
" When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, then 50 feet of crap, then me.",,,,,,Rachel
 Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?,,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know, I don't know.",,,,,,Rachel
" Wait, are you leaving?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all, what?",,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, I think that was the whole all.",,,,,,Rachel
 No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andy McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.,,,,,,Rachel
 You're welcome.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I forget which ones.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you. What a bitch.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, guys, what's up.",,,,,,Rachel
" Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?",,,,,,Rachel
 You went shopping for fur?,,,,,,Rachel
 You bought boobs?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, this is so cute.",,,,,,Rachel
" Did you just say Hi, Jew?",,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.",,,,,,Rachel
 They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon. Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?",,,,,,Rachel
 And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket,,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?",,,,,,Rachel
 Who?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 You were with Julie?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh. Oh my god.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, right.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdales? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually, but now she's actually stealing you.",,,,,,Rachel
 I love you too.,,,,,,Rachel
" I'd do anything for you, you know that.",,,,,,Rachel
" So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?",,,,,,Rachel
 Really? Me?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you're not totally paranoid.",,,,,,Rachel
" Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, Julie. What a manipulative bitch.",,,,,,Rachel
" Come on, they were not that huge.",,,,,,Rachel
 You don't have birds.,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, bye-bye.",,,,,,Rachel
" ""Oh, my, god.""",,,,,,Rachel
 We won. We won!,,,,,,Rachel
 How did this happen?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, so let's talk money.",,,,,,Rachel
 Have you ever seen so much crap?,,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.",,,,,,Rachel
" What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, what about my stuff?",,,,,,Rachel
" You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, while you ""mmm"" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, let it go.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.",,,,,,Rachel
 I am. Let me just get my coat.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, you win.",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.",,,,,,Rachel
 She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.,,,,,,Rachel
 You are ready to make a commitment!,,,,,,Rachel
 What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
 It's really not that big!,,,,,,Rachel
" Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing [a pigeon flies in the window and lands on the table] OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. [hangs up] OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. [grabs a pot and lid] OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. [puts pot over the pigeon] Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. [knock at the door] It's open you guys.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, hi can I help you?",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.",,,,,,Rachel
 What? [in surprise she forgets she has the pigeon in the pot and lets it get away],,,,,,Rachel
 What!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?",,,,,,Rachel
" [to Monica at the counter] Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Bye-bye Julie. [Julie leaves],,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, c'mon, cut it out.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Sure.,,,,,,Rachel
" What? C'mon, talk to me.",,,,,,Rachel
" Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having s*x?",,,,,,Rachel
" Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?",,,,,,Rachel
" No, no no no, don't need to know the details.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?",,,,,,Rachel
 I think it's sexy.,,,,,,Rachel
 Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have s*x.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?,,,,,,Rachel
 I'd wait.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have s*x with, with another man. That just means it's working.",,,,,,Rachel
" More than jewelry. [Rachel struts off, extremely pleased with herself]",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?",,,,,,Rachel
" What did, what did he say?",,,,,,Rachel
" Great, people having s*x, that's just what I need to see.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.",,,,,,Rachel
" Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.",,,,,,Rachel
" So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?",,,,,,Rachel
" OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?",,,,,,Rachel
" Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.",,,,,,Rachel
" Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?",,,,,,Rachel
" Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.",,,,,,Rachel
 Maybe you should put it off.,,,,,,Rachel
" I know, yeah, sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
" Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.",,,,,,Rachel
" And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, God.",,,,,,Rachel
" (sarcastically) Hi, Julie.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, whoosh!",,,,,,Rachel
" So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?",,,,,,Rachel
" Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?",,,,,,Rachel
" For Ross, Ross, Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, I will have the uh, (whispers) side salad.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?",,,,,,Rachel
" Um, everyone?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.",,,,,,Rachel
 That's 'cause you have it.,,,,,,Rachel
" Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ok.,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.",,,,,,Rachel
 Me neither.,,,,,,Rachel
" What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?",,,,,,Rachel
 Fine.,,,,,,Rachel
 Happy birthday.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?",,,,,,Rachel
 On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?,,,,,,Rachel
 What party?,,,,,,Rachel
 Who gave you that hickey?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel

 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ok.,,,,,,Rachel

 But what about Phoebe?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, I'm sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
" Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying ""Terry's a jerk!"" That's where that came from.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.< br>",,,,,,Rachel
" Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.",,,,,,Rachel
" Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Done.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, but Pheebs.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
 Here. I thought you might be cold.,,,,,,Rachel
" Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.",,,,,,Rachel
 Do you?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for ""Smelly Cat"".",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.",,,,,,Rachel
" [on phone] Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. [hangs up and tosses phone in the ice bucket]",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Uhh, the mailman, the super.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.",,,,,,Rachel
 Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.",,,,,,Rachel
 How have you never been on Oprah?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, nothin'.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent. [hands her a smashed box]",,,,,,Rachel
" Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .",,,,,,Rachel
" OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. [she walks off and Ross puts his hand to his hair]",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.",,,,,,Rachel
 Did you just break the radiator?,,,,,,Rachel
 I'll call the super.,,,,,,Rachel
" [on phone] Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.",,,,,,Rachel

 [answering the door] Mr. Treeger.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I'm with Mon.",,,,,,Rachel
 What'cha gonna' do?,,,,,,Rachel
 Nice seizing. . . gel boy.,,,,,,Rachel
" Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.",,,,,,Rachel
" Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.",,,,,,Rachel
 Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.,,,,,,Rachel
 [entering hurriedly] Did I miss it? Did I miss it?,,,,,,Rachel
" I'm sorry, what?",,,,,,Rachel
 That's great!,,,,,,Rachel
 What do you mean?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, who ordered what?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh god.,,,,,,Rachel
" I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?",,,,,,Rachel
 Mom!,,,,,,Rachel
 Pretty much.,,,,,,Rachel
" This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh Mom!,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?",,,,,,Rachel
 For...me.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, what do you mean?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.,,,,,,Rachel
 None.,,,,,,Rachel
" No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?",,,,,,Rachel
" I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?",,,,,,Rachel
 These are from Halloween three years ago.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.",,,,,,Rachel
" Actually, what I think you said was, ""don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.""",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, Mon, you want some help?",,,,,,Rachel
 She's still with you?,,,,,,Rachel
 God!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! What's new in s*x?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?",,,,,,Rachel
 You want me to talk you out of it?,,,,,,Rachel
 Then what? What do you want?,,,,,,Rachel
 Why on earth would I understand this?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, Mom? Having fun?",,,,,,Rachel
" There's more alcohol, right?",,,,,,Rachel
 I had a wedding.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.",,,,,,Rachel
 And she's not crazy?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God.,,,,,,Rachel
 Not at all inappropriate!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, so what're you gonna do?",,,,,,Rachel
" No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I know, I know. [Turns on the TV. Joey in on it.]",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me. [throws water in his face]",,,,,,Rachel
 You're kidding.,,,,,,Rachel
 OK.,,,,,,Rachel
 Now just how big of a star is Marcel?,,,,,,Rachel
 What what what what?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ya think?,,,,,,Rachel
" No, was he any good in it?",,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?",,,,,,Rachel
" What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?",,,,,,Rachel
" OK, I'm doin' it for ya.",,,,,,Rachel
 Excuse me. Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.",,,,,,Rachel
" I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?",,,,,,Rachel
" Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.",,,,,,Rachel
" He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.",,,,,,Rachel
" Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.",,,,,,Rachel
 And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.,,,,,,Rachel
 Does anybody need anything?,,,,,,Rachel
 That is so unfair.,,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. [Monica starts making faces behind her back] She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?",,,,,,Rachel
 That is the most ridiculous.,,,,,,Rachel
 I did not sell you out.,,,,,,Rachel
 Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead],,,,,,Rachel
" OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]",,,,,,Rachel
" Ow, you stop flicking.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?",,,,,,Rachel
 You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh that's what you want.,,,,,,Rachel
 Fine.,,,,,,Rachel
 No. [hitting each other],,,,,,Rachel
 No. [hitting again],,,,,,Rachel
" OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.",,,,,,Rachel
" OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play. [She grabs a jar of tomato sauce and Monica's purse]",,,,,,Rachel
 You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.",,,,,,Rachel
 I'll help you throw out your purse.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.",,,,,,Rachel
" OK, well, bye. [kisses him]",,,,,,Rachel
" OK, well, bye-bye again. [kisses him again]",,,,,,Rachel
 Impressive.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.",,,,,,Rachel
" What, what incident?",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" What are you, what are you doin'?",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?",,,,,,Rachel
" OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, there is no us, OK.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.",,,,,,Rachel
" NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, no, ACC-cept that.",,,,,,Rachel
 [comes up from behind the bar and startles Chandler] Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found? [holds up Chandler's bracelet],,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God.,,,,,,Rachel
" They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ahh, so do you, beautiful. [they hug]",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?",,,,,,Rachel
" [the shoulders of her dress keep falling off her shoulders] Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, the guys are here.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.",,,,,,Rachel
" Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?",,,,,,Rachel
" I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.",,,,,,Rachel
" I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi you guys.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey you.,,,,,,Rachel
" So, uh, how was your day?",,,,,,Rachel
 Really? Mine too.,,,,,,Rachel
 OK. [they go to kiss but everyone's watching so Ross just kisses her on the top of her head and leaves],,,,,,Rachel
 It is our first official date. Our first date.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.",,,,,,Rachel
" C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.",,,,,,Rachel
 Monica.,,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, I'm just checking.",,,,,,Rachel
 Monica.,,,,,,Rachel
 Monica.,,,,,,Rachel
" I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.",,,,,,Rachel
 OK. [start kissing again and Rachel starts lauging again],,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.",,,,,,Rachel
 Just one cheek.,,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.",,,,,,Rachel
 C'mon touch it.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, come on squeeze it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Rub it.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi you guys.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .",,,,,,Rachel
" OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.",,,,,,Rachel
 What's this.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi you guys.,,,,,,Rachel
" Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.",,,,,,Rachel
" When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here. [points to the tip of her nose]",,,,,,Rachel
 I know.,,,,,,Rachel
" It's OK, it's fine.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?",,,,,,Rachel
 We won't?,,,,,,Rachel
" OK, that's dead right?",,,,,,Rachel
 What is this? What are we doing?,,,,,,Rachel
 Grape.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, God.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ah, so what are we looking at?",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight. [they kiss]",,,,,,Rachel
 This time it's not so funny.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, thank God.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.,,,,,,Rachel

" [enters from her room] OK, ready when you are.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?",,,,,,Rachel
 Well I. . .,,,,,,Rachel

 Why didn't you get it?,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.",,,,,,Rachel
" Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
 Is Ross here?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh really, OK. [shows Monica her tattoo]",,,,,,Rachel
 What? You didn't get one.,,,,,,Rachel
" That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo. [she bends over and bears her tattoo right when Ross returns]",,,,,,Rachel
 Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well?,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
 I guess.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?",,,,,,Rachel

" Hey, nice toilet.",,,,,,Rachel
" OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood.",,,,,,Rachel
" Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.",,,,,,Rachel
 What's goin' on?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.",,,,,,Rachel
" Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.",,,,,,Rachel
 [sarcastically] I've never wanted you more.,,,,,,Rachel
" Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.",,,,,,Rachel
" It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.",,,,,,Rachel
" Pretty uhm, different huh?",,,,,,Rachel
 Would you guys stop.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God.,,,,,,Rachel
" Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy. [goes in the bathroom]",,,,,,Rachel

" Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal s*x. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.",,,,,,Rachel
" God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.",,,,,,Rachel
" But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hi.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, honey that's great.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.,,,,,,Rachel

" Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?",,,,,,Rachel

 Wow.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.",,,,,,Rachel
 NO!,,,,,,Rachel
" No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?",,,,,,Rachel
" No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
" You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.",,,,,,Rachel
" Not uh, not to my recollection.",,,,,,Rachel
 Only 'cause you took up half the circle.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.,,,,,,Rachel
 Here are your cakes.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.",,,,,,Rachel
 You know.,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you. So are we good?,,,,,,Rachel
 We're good?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.",,,,,,Rachel

 No luck huh?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah sure, Ok. [she takes Ben and holds him at arms length]",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, I'm holding Ben.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ok.,,,,,,Rachel
 This is how I would hold a football.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 You think about stuff like that?,,,,,,Rachel
" Two, two babies?",,,,,,Rachel
 Then what's gonna happen?,,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.",,,,,,Rachel
" I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this [hands back Ben] and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door? [leaves]",,,,,,Rachel
 [enters] Aghh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.",,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.",,,,,,Rachel
 What was the book?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.",,,,,,Rachel
" But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
 I didn't know that.,,,,,,Rachel
" Fine, I will.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well I love you too.,,,,,,Rachel

" We love you, we're here for you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, what is in that?",,,,,,Rachel
" No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.",,,,,,Rachel
 Run Phoebe run.,,,,,,Rachel
 Are you kidding me?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, here, I know what we can do. [grabs Joey's sadwich and throws it out the window]",,,,,,Rachel

 Nobody does honey.,,,,,,Rachel
 Look at her.,,,,,,Rachel
" Agh, it was the graduation from hell.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.",,,,,,Rachel
" My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.",,,,,,Rachel

 I can't believe this is happening.,,,,,,Rachel
 I do.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well those are very popular frames.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, like a chimney.",,,,,,Rachel
 You want me to see a therapist?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.",,,,,,Rachel
" Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.",,,,,,Rachel
" This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.",,,,,,Rachel
" It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh ok.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ok.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, I've got one. [blows out the candles. Somebody calls out 'heads up' and the volleyball lands in the flan] Wow, those things almost never come true.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.",,,,,,Rachel
 You went out with a guy in the Navy?,,,,,,Rachel
" So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?",,,,,,Rachel
 Well I've had it.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.",,,,,,Rachel
" You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, stop that, stop that right now.",,,,,,Rachel
" No sorry hon, Monica's orders.",,,,,,Rachel
 And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.,,,,,,Rachel
" So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.",,,,,,Rachel
 It was nice to meet you.,,,,,,Rachel
" So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ok.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.",,,,,,Rachel
 I'll say.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well then uh, we better make this night count. [He starts to carry her out.] Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. [He carries her over to turn it off.] Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. [He carries her to the counter to pick up her purse.] Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, right.",,,,,,Rachel
 I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.,,,,,,Rachel
 Because I promised Mindy I would.,,,,,,Rachel
" Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.",,,,,,Rachel
 Nooo!,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! What's that like?,,,,,,Rachel
 Afraid to ask him?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.",,,,,,Rachel
" God I know, you're right.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, I'll see you after the thing.",,,,,,Rachel
" Thank you, Okay, Okay. ",,,,,,Rachel
 Why the hell didn't you tell me!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hi!",,,,,,Rachel
 I know.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?",,,,,,Rachel
 Insane!,,,,,,Rachel

" Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh dear God.,,,,,,Rachel
 (to Ross) She you in the parking lot.,,,,,,Rachel
" (after a pause with everyone staring at her, she goes up to the microphone) Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings (da-doom-chesh). See now, tonight, all I",,,,,,Rachel
" (singing) ""...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody..""",,,,,,Rachel
" At the Copa, Copa Cabana (everyone joins in) The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.",,,,,,Rachel
 Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.,,,,,,Rachel
" What song was that, Pheebs?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey Mon!,,,,,,Rachel
" No, it's been three nights in a row.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?",,,,,,Rachel
" (she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) Honey, I was wondering....",,,,,,Rachel
" Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hmm.,,,,,,Rachel
" You remember not having s*x in high school, right?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well honey, what about you?",,,,,,Rachel
" I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?",,,,,,Rachel

" Oh, really, let me see, let me see.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.",,,,,,Rachel
 Were both of those Joey?,,,,,,Rachel
 Not even with your best friend.,,,,,,Rachel
" That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.",,,,,,Rachel
 Pretty much.,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering from bathroom) Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.",,,,,,Rachel
 How come you didn't come over earlier?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I just have to get dressed.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering from her bedroom) You guys, (holds up an outfit) does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering from her bedroom) What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering from her room) Is this a little too... (sees Phoebe) Pheebs, what happened?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?",,,,,,Rachel
" No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.",,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?",,,,,,Rachel
" Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.",,,,,,Rachel
" No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering from her room) Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?",,,,,,Rachel
 But I...,,,,,,Rachel
 All right.,,,,,,Rachel
 I'm not gonna gooo.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.",,,,,,Rachel
" I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.",,,,,,Rachel
 It's fine.,,,,,,Rachel
 I'm not mad.,,,,,,Rachel

" No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!",,,,,,Rachel
" You were really gonna do that, weren't you?",,,,,,Rachel
 You were gonna drink the fat.,,,,,,Rachel
" And I still have about five seconds to spare. (kisses him) Okay, that was about seven seconds.",,,,,,Rachel
" Come on. (they start to leave) Oh! And, uh, by the way....",,,,,,Rachel
" I'm going commando, too.",,,,,,Rachel
 I didn't know there were docks.,,,,,,Rachel

 Hello.,,,,,,Rachel
" Noo way, Kevin.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with",,,,,,Rachel

 Men are unbelievable.,,,,,,Rachel
" Amazingly, that makes sense.",,,,,,Rachel
" Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies",,,,,,Rachel
 Very nice touch.,,,,,,Rachel
 Unbelievable.,,,,,,Rachel

 This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself,,,,,,Rachel
" Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally",,,,,,Rachel
" Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel

" Oh-oh, you lie.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.",,,,,,Rachel
" You know what honey, you go ahead, we’ll call her an alternate.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, he’s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I’m just sorry we don’t got popcorn.",,,,,,Rachel
" Excuse me, there was no time!",,,,,,Rachel
 Does anybody need more coffee?,,,,,,Rachel

" That’s all right. (to her friends) I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ummm, I think it’s time to see the ring again. (holds her hand out and they all scream)",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I know.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I don’t know. Well maybe it’s just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don’t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (Chandler is listening in very intensely)",,,,,,Rachel
" I’m serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, s*x y'know, with the next guy that I see.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, so?",,,,,,Rachel

 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
" Um, (shyly) Barry.",,,,,,Rachel

" So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not gonna change.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well um, I don’t.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do something about that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he really didn’t.",,,,,,Rachel
" You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans and rubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.",,,,,,Rachel
 Um. yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)",,,,,,Rachel

" Um, there was a Geller Cup?",,,,,,Rachel
" Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.",,,,,,Rachel

" Monica, I’m your best friend.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ross!,,,,,,Rachel
 You don’t pick me! You’re stuck with me!,,,,,,Rachel
" (coming over to Ross, who is just getting up) Are you okay?",,,,,,Rachel
 Over here!,,,,,,Rachel
 (proud of her self) I almost caught that one!,,,,,,Rachel
" Wait, what am I gonna do?",,,,,,Rachel
" Wait, how long?",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it’s like all I’m doing is running back and forth from the huddle.",,,,,,Rachel
 Can I see that for second.,,,,,,Rachel
" Now, does it really matter?",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, so are we not having dinner at all?",,,,,,Rachel
 I went really long.,,,,,,Rachel
 I can not believe your trading me!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Are you gonna let me play?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!!! Kill ‘um!!!,,,,,,Rachel
 No! Come on! Don’t make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.,,,,,,Rachel
" God, I’m not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you! Break!,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m so sorry! Are you okay?,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn’t know what to do.",,,,,,Rachel
 (on the verge of tears) Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 (in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!,,,,,,Rachel
 We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there’s a like league we could join or something.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?",,,,,,Rachel
" (to Chandler) Eh, do you believe that?",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m gonna get back to retraining. (gets up),,,,,,Rachel
" Gunther, Gunther, please, I’ve worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Huh. Well, y'know that’s actually a really good idea, because that way they’ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.",,,,,,Rachel
" Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I’m, I’m sorry. (walks away)",,,,,,Rachel
" (sitting down next to Chandler) I’m training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, yeah! I’m still pursuing that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I’m also sending out.... good thoughts.",,,,,,Rachel
 The fear?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate, I mean why don’t you quit and get ‘the fear’?",,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don’t want to be 30 and still work here.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Can’t I just look at the handles on them?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress? Because, I don’t care. I don’t care. I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don’t think I should do it anymore. I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.",,,,,,Rachel
" Gunther, I quit.",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Okay, stop what you’re doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey-hey-hey that’s funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!,,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t know, I don’t know, weren’t you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!",,,,,,Rachel
" No, it’s not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don’t have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I’m just gonna, I’m just gonna call Gunther and I’m gonna tell him, I’m not quitting.",,,,,,Rachel
 You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....,,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thanks.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I blew it. I wouldn’t of even hired me.",,,,,,Rachel
" I can’t! It’s too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. (points to her) Look at her, she’s even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... (starts to cry) swans.",,,,,,Rachel
" (answering the phone) Hello? (listens) Yeah, this is she. (listens) Oh! You’re kidding! You’re kidding! (listens) Oh thank you! I love you!",,,,,,Rachel
 (hanging up the phone) I got the job!,,,,,,Rachel
 Here we go. I’m serving my last cup of coffee. (the gang starts humming the graduation theme) There you go. (hands it to Chandler) Enjoy. (they all cheer),,,,,,Rachel
" Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it’s just time to move on. (at the counter Gunther starts to cry and runs into the back room) Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow.,,,,,,Rachel
" Noo, that’s our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.",,,,,,Rachel
 Good luck.,,,,,,Rachel
" (jumping up from reading her magazine) Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.",,,,,,Rachel
 I know!,,,,,,Rachel
 Op.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you got me.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that sounds great.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t.... I don’t mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.",,,,,,Rachel
 (to him) Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?,,,,,,Rachel
" It’s not funny, this is actually my job.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh well then, so I’m just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes?!,,,,,,Rachel
 (looks at Monica) (to him) Do you want my pickle?,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering, to Ross) The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! So I’m out having lunch at Monica’s and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale’s and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he’s gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!",,,,,,Rachel
 I know!,,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.",,,,,,Rachel
 What!?,,,,,,Rachel
 To be nice.,,,,,,Rachel
" I didn’t have to, because I was wearing my ‘I heart Ross’ sandwich board and ringing my bell.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that’s true of any job.",,,,,,Rachel
 I mean that’s unbelievable.,,,,,,Rachel
" Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.",,,,,,Rachel
 That’s all right.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey. (they all walk away from Chandler),,,,,,Rachel
 Did he call? Did Mark call?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) Oh my God, is that Phoebe?",,,,,,Rachel
 Music. Very nice.,,,,,,Rachel
" So, how are you?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, what’s it about?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I do. (they both run out)",,,,,,Rachel
" I can’t believe Mark didn’t call. It’s Sunday night, and he didn’t call.",,,,,,Rachel
" (to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, and you don’t mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.",,,,,,Rachel
" (on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, it’s Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no, don’t you apologize. (listens) Yeah, I’ll hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.",,,,,,Rachel
" (on phone) Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it’s perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! (hangs up phone) I got the interview!",,,,,,Rachel
 He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.,,,,,,Rachel
 I got to figure out what I’m going to wear.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later. (starts to leave) Woo hoo!",,,,,,Rachel
 (getting of the elevator and noticing Ross) Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 What are you doing here?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn’t shut up.",,,,,,Rachel
 Me too!,,,,,,Rachel
 I know.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. (turns around) Hi Mark!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I did!",,,,,,Rachel
" (to Ross) Oh my God!! (she turns around and hugs Mark, not Ross)",,,,,,Rachel
" Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, I’m sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
" (running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?",,,,,,Rachel
 (to Ross) Tell him.,,,,,,Rachel
" (running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (to Phoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!! I love this job! (her phone rings) Wow! My first call.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi honey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, he's just goofing around.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?,,,,,,Rachel
" I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. (to Mark) Mark, I need you!",,,,,,Rachel
 Ow! Ross!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm... (she picks up this bug and it starts to play the theme from Love Story)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes.,,,,,,Rachel
 All right Ross!! I get it!!,,,,,,Rachel
 You're hurt!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!",,,,,,Rachel
" Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohhh! That is soo sweet! (gets up to get herself a cup of coffee),,,,,,Rachel
 (now standing behind Ross) Ross!,,,,,,Rachel
" So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?",,,,,,Rachel
 Right.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hello.,,,,,,Rachel
 A big idiot.,,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (she kisses him)",,,,,,Rachel
 Where ya going?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, with who?",,,,,,Rachel
 There was a woman at the... (realizes) The stripper?!,,,,,,Rachel
 You have a play date with a stripper?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Sure, is she married?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.),,,,,,Rachel
" Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?",,,,,,Rachel
" I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...",,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.",,,,,,Rachel
" (to Chandler) Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.",,,,,,Rachel
" (looking at her watch) Oh my God, I gotta go to work!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh I don’t know honey. It’s gonna be really late.,,,,,,Rachel
" I know. I’m sorry. Look, I’ll make a deal with you all right? Okay?",,,,,,Rachel
 For every night that you’re asleep before I get home from work...,,,,,,Rachel
 I will wake you up in a way that’s proved very popular in the past.,,,,,,Rachel
 Right.,,,,,,Rachel
 Somebody got in late last night.,,,,,,Rachel
 When did this happen?,,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, what are you doing?",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
 Do you have any ice?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?",,,,,,Rachel
" Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?",,,,,,Rachel
" But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?",,,,,,Rachel
 How often do you read it?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Ah, well we’ll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, (she tries to take the book away from him but he doesn’t want to let it go) and you will read Little Women.",,,,,,Rachel
 All right.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Danny just went into room 217.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you’re gonna ruin it!",,,,,,Rachel
 Joey! I can’t believe you just did that!,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she’s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.",,,,,,Rachel
 Eh. Beth dies.,,,,,,Rachel
 Um-hmm.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 No. She doesn’t die.,,,,,,Rachel
" Because, I wanted to hurt you.",,,,,,Rachel
 (gasps) Oh my....,,,,,,Rachel
 (screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) Sorry. I’m sorry.,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m sorry, I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Awwww.,,,,,,Rachel
 Joey?,,,,,,Rachel
 Do you want to put the book in the freezer?,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, sweetie!",,,,,,Rachel
 I’ve got some bad news.,,,,,,Rachel
" I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.",,,,,,Rachel
" Nooo, he’s leaving for a better job.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well we’re gonna miss you around here.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, you bet.",,,,,,Rachel
 Funny book?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn’t mind.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, please tell me it’s not because I’m going with Mark.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God!!! Ross!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Because, he’s my friend.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?",,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t know, you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.",,,,,,Rachel
 Really!?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. (Ross has a worried look on his face) What?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh. (puts her hand over his mouth),,,,,,Rachel
 Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’t make that much noise when it hit rocks!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had!’",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that is so...",,,,,,Rachel
" Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?",,,,,,Rachel
" It’s not dumb. But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean it’s like, I-I-I like that you’re not involved in that part of my life.",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know, I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it, because it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!!,,,,,,Rachel
 (answering her phone at work) Hello.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hi.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I’ve got to get this order in. Honey, I’m so sorry, but it looks like I’m gonna be here all night.",,,,,,Rachel
" No-no-no, no, honey please, I’ve got, I’ve just have so much to deal with.",,,,,,Rachel
" (on the phone) No, no, no, I’m looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... (listens) What does it matter, what I’m wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? (listens) Thank you. (to Sophie) We’re holding.",,,,,,Rachel
" (startled) Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, honey, I’m sorry, I know it’s our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don’t have time to stop.",,,,,,Rachel
" But I don’t, hmm... (on phone) Oh, who approved that order?! (listens) Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. (to Sophie) Get me Mark on the phone!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for (Ross starts making a lot of noise with a handheld pepper grinder) this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...(stops and looks at Ross)",,,,,,Rachel
 (angrily) None for me.,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I’m sorry but that’s... (notices a fire that Ross’s candle has started) Oh my God!!",,,,,,Rachel
" (on phone) Excuse me, I’m sorry, I’m gonna have to call you back, I’ve got a Schemp in my office. (hangs up) (to Ross) What are you doing?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross you’re not listening to me, I don’t have time to stop.",,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t have ten minutes!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don’t!",,,,,,Rachel
" Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I’ve got a deadline, would you just go home, I’ll talk to you later. (storms out)",,,,,,Rachel
 Good bye!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...",,,,,,Rachel
 (throws her stuff down) I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.,,,,,,Rachel
 You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody’s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!,,,,,,Rachel
" But I told you, I didn’t have the time!",,,,,,Rachel
" Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?",,,,,,Rachel
 Just a job!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...,,,,,,Rachel
 Well neither do I!,,,,,,Rachel
 (shocked) Oh my God.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.",,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.",,,,,,Rachel
 No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.,,,,,,Rachel
 (jumping up to answer the phone) Hello!,,,,,,Rachel
 (disappointed) Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. Well, umm.....",,,,,,Rachel
" (on the verge of tears) Yeah, I’m fine.",,,,,,Rachel
" No! Really, no, please, please, that’s, that’s okay.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah, I’m not, I’m not hungry.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. Okay, bye.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.",,,,,,Rachel
" No. (grabs an eggroll) And then I called him, and he wasn’t there.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, thank you that’s very helpful, I’m glad you came over.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hello.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! Oh, I’m so glad you called.",,,,,,Rachel
 Nobody.,,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, honey, look he just came over to....",,,,,,Rachel
" (picks up the phone and calls Ross) Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you’re not home.",,,,,,Rachel
 You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?,,,,,,Rachel
 (shocked) Oh my God.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.",,,,,,Rachel
 No. A break from us.,,,,,,Rachel
" Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.",,,,,,Rachel
 Nobody.,,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, honey, look he just came over to....",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, we never actually got to dinner.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, we kinda broke up instead.",,,,,,Rachel
" (looking up at the ceiling) God, Monica it’s on the ceiling.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.",,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.",,,,,,Rachel
" (on answering machine) Hi, it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.",,,,,,Rachel
" Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don’t want to get back together over a machine.",,,,,,Rachel
" So, I love you.",,,,,,Rachel
" And y'know what, I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I’m gonna stop by around 8:30.",,,,,,Rachel
 Bye.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.",,,,,,Rachel
 So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?,,,,,,Rachel
 I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!,,,,,,Rachel
 Just get away from me!,,,,,,Rachel
 A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, you had s*x with another woman!",,,,,,Rachel
" (opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!",,,,,,Rachel
 Just get out! Now!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay! All right! How was she?,,,,,,Rachel
 Was she good?,,,,,,Rachel
" Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she?",,,,,,Rachel
 Good different?,,,,,,Rachel
" Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? (Ross can’t answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!",,,,,,Rachel
 And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!,,,,,,Rachel
 We were on a break!,,,,,,Rachel
 You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!",,,,,,Rachel
 God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.",,,,,,Rachel
 All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?,,,,,,Rachel
" You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?",,,,,,Rachel
" You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....",,,,,,Rachel
" I’m thinking, I’m gonna order a pizza.",,,,,,Rachel
" Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza.",,,,,,Rachel
" With ah, extra anchovies.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.",,,,,,Rachel
 That’s....,,,,,,Rachel
 That is neither here nor there.,,,,,,Rachel
" No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?",,,,,,Rachel
 (softly) I think you should go.,,,,,,Rachel
 (softly) I really think you need to go now.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, what the hell did I know!",,,,,,Rachel
" (crying) No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t, (Ross stands up and backs away) it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything. Forever.",,,,,,Rachel
 Then how come it is?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.",,,,,,Rachel
 Closer than here?,,,,,,Rachel
" Wait, I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee.",,,,,,Rachel
 (softly) Is he here?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh. (smiles) Here’s your moisturiser. Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (they’re all silent and look away) Okay, I said that out loud right?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hm-mm.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it’s okay. (starts to leave)",,,,,,Rachel
 And heels.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that’s only fair. (leaves)",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I’m asking you first, right?!. I mean I’m playing by the rules.",,,,,,Rachel
 Chandler! You’re smoking? What are you doing?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 No. Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is ‘no tissue, no tuschy.’ (Phoebe laughs and gets out.) Well, if everybody’s going. (She gets out and starts to close the door.)",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I stuff outside the bra.",,,,,,Rachel
" (seeing him) Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.",,,,,,Rachel
" What, what’s it, what’s going on?",,,,,,Rachel
 So you know how to fix it?,,,,,,Rachel
 Great!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.",,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.",,,,,,Rachel
" No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!",,,,,,Rachel
" No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.",,,,,,Rachel
" (all excited) Op, op, car! Car!! (sees it’s Ross) Ugh!!!",,,,,,Rachel
 What is he doing here?!,,,,,,Rachel
 All right!! Fine! Fine.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ask me what?,,,,,,Rachel
 You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.,,,,,,Rachel
 Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier.,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, let’s go!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I’m sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?",,,,,,Rachel
 Y'know Ross why don’t you put that on your answering machine!,,,,,,Rachel
 (to Monica) What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Really Joey?,,,,,,Rachel
" No, I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I’m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)",,,,,,Rachel
" Come on, it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since.",,,,,,Rachel
 (to Ross) What’s your problem?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, y'know what, I didn’t want cinnamon on this.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God!! Great!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.",,,,,,Rachel
" (laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.",,,,,,Rachel
 I think you should definitely go out with this guy.,,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger?",,,,,,Rachel
 All right.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey Mon, let’s give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.",,,,,,Rachel
 We use it!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, I can’t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, sure, that too.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Just one drink?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! All right, let’s go shoppin’!!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, okay.",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! Umm....,,,,,,Rachel
 I know.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no.",,,,,,Rachel
" I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him, which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross or something.",,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t have any issues with my Father.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, y'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, just sort of stuff that you’ve left here.",,,,,,Rachel
" No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
 Good.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug.",,,,,,Rachel
 You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....",,,,,,Rachel
 Petty... (goes into her room),,,,,,Rachel
 Petty...,,,,,,Rachel
 Small...,,,,,,Rachel
 You are so just doing this out of spite.,,,,,,Rachel
 Huh?,,,,,,Rachel
 You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even fit you anymore!,,,,,,Rachel
 (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’",,,,,,Rachel
 Y'know what?,,,,,,Rachel
 I can’t do this.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh God. I’m sorry about this.,,,,,,Rachel
 You sure?,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)",,,,,,Rachel
 (She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.),,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, Sophie!",,,,,,Rachel
" Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn’t have to walk me all the way back up here.",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s lingerie here in the office?",,,,,,Rachel
 Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue),,,,,,Rachel
" (introduces them) Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler) Joanna.",,,,,,Rachel
" Bye, Chandler.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, nothing, he’s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.",,,,,,Rachel
" No!! No! He’s not married, or involved, with anyone!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too?",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 I need to talk to you!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...",,,,,,Rachel
" (looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she’s gonna love me.",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow!!,,,,,,Rachel
 What’s this?,,,,,,Rachel
 All right!,,,,,,Rachel
" (to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hmm.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I....",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I know...",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?",,,,,,Rachel
" You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, they always called.",,,,,,Rachel
 No. Sorry.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well...,,,,,,Rachel
 No. I...,,,,,,Rachel
 (grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!,,,,,,Rachel
" Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy!",,,,,,Rachel
" Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her!",,,,,,Rachel
 Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.,,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!",,,,,,Rachel
 That’s fine!,,,,,,Rachel
 I know.,,,,,,Rachel
 Sophie’s desk.,,,,,,Rachel
 (whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!,,,,,,Rachel
 Chandler!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now. (She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)",,,,,,Rachel
 So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?,,,,,,Rachel
 What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?,,,,,,Rachel
 And you’re still not attracted to him at all?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me",,,,,,Rachel
 I know. ,,,,,,Rachel
 Ow!!,,,,,,Rachel
 (looking at the outfit) Got a job on a river boat?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.",,,,,,Rachel
" Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, come here!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!,,,,,,Rachel
" (she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but",,,,,,Rachel
 (She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m fine, I’m fine.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes I am! ,,,,,,Rachel
" Look, I’m fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her",,,,,,Rachel
 No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be",,,,,,Rachel
" But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.",,,,,,Rachel
" Look, either help me or go.",,,,,,Rachel
" (with a hurt expression on her face) Okay, but before you go,",,,,,,Rachel
 (She drops the brush) Y'know what? I cannot do this with my,,,,,,Rachel
 (taking the brush back) Okay. Let’s use this brush. (Hands him,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh-ho!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! That’s just poking me in the eye!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, just sweep it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Right.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t...",,,,,,Rachel
" We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.",,,,,,Rachel
" Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of",,,,,,Rachel
 Blow it.,,,,,,Rachel
 Sophisticated like a hooker?,,,,,,Rachel
 Sure.,,,,,,Rachel
" Sure, I’ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.",,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t want you to see me naked!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, but that was different. Y’know? I mean, we were, we were",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ross! Stop that!,,,,,,Rachel
 Come on! I don’t want you thinking of me like that any more!,,,,,,Rachel
 Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!,,,,,,Rachel
 Rosss...,,,,,,Rachel
 All right. (She starts to take off her robe) Fine.,,,,,,Rachel
" O-kay!! See what you did, I’m gonna be doing it by myself now.",,,,,,Rachel
 That’s it. (She crawls onto the bed) Ow!!! ,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh-ow!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ow!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ow!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ow!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ow! Ow!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, I do. ",,,,,,Rachel
 I really do.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you’re not gonna come with me?",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you. (She goes to take off her make-up and screams in,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m sorry, I just can’t go to the hospital lookin’ like this.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, you’d tell me the truth. Right?",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 What thing? What thing?,,,,,,Rachel
 What thing? What is this thing?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! ,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, why didn’t you tell me that?",,,,,,Rachel
 I cannot believe you.,,,,,,Rachel
" That is the sweetest thing, I just....",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I’m sorry I spoiled you’re evening.",,,,,,Rachel
" Um-hmm, yeah.",,,,,,Rachel
 (After he closes the door) See ya.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.",,,,,,Rachel
 What’s Flimby’s?,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. Hang up! That’s it! Come on!,,,,,,Rachel
" No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so…",,,,,,Rachel
" I meant, me plus one!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, bye-bye!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, I need a date! (runs to her bedroom)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hi!",,,,,,Rachel
" How are you? (She goes to kiss him on the cheek, but stops because of the dates and pats him on the shoulder.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, uhh, I think I’m going to run to the ladies room.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hi!",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.",,,,,,Rachel
 We’re not actors.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 What time is it?,,,,,,Rachel
" Tommy’s supposed to be here soon, we’re going to lunch.",,,,,,Rachel
 You don’t?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.",,,,,,Rachel
 (not seeing Ross) What’s your favourite thing about summertime?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah…,,,,,,Rachel
" Tommyyyy! Say, what’s your favourite thing about summer?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, would you just stop it! It’s getting really old.",,,,,,Rachel
 Phoe-be!!,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering, interrupting them) Hey guys! What's... (sees what they're doing and stops, the guys are stunned)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.",,,,,,Rachel
 What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 And?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?",,,,,,Rachel
" So Pheebs, pick one of them.",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering with Phoebe) This place is amazing.,,,,,,Rachel
 (standing up) Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, “Look how much money we’ve got!” Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it’ll be dry, but people will like it.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!",,,,,,Rachel
" OH MY GOD!!! (She holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look at her.) Sorry, I was just imagining what it’d be like to catch the money bouquet.",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Hi! Okay, don’t be mad at me, but I couldn’t resist.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, and I know that you’d say no if he asked you, but I’m sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. (shows her the picture.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God. (starting to cry),,,,,,Rachel
 You didn’t break up with that fireman?,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow!,,,,,,Rachel
 How’d it go with Pete?!,,,,,,Rachel
" So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?",,,,,,Rachel
 Why?! What is it?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Y'know I don’t, I don’t understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin’ her boob.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, ah with who?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! (laughs) That’s fine.,,,,,,Rachel
" (to Phoebe) Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?",,,,,,Rachel
 This is Bonnie? (to Phoebe) This is Bonnie? (to Bonnie) You’re Bonnie?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, I’m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that must be it.",,,,,,Rachel
 (to Phoebe) You said she was bald.,,,,,,Rachel
 How could you not tell me that she has hair?,,,,,,Rachel
" (looks in the window) Ohh, well, this is just perfect!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!",,,,,,Rachel
" Why, does she have a bad personality?",,,,,,Rachel
" (seeing Ross and Bonnie inside Central Perk) Oh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl.",,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe! (goes back to the window),,,,,,Rachel
" Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh! (walking away from the window) Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.",,,,,,Rachel
 You said she was bald!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, we can’t, we just can’t just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!",,,,,,Rachel
 (quietly) Yes.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes.,,,,,,Rachel
" I just y'know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh! (sits down on the curb)",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I can’t watch this. (turns her eyes away)",,,,,,Rachel
 (to Monica) I mean is that woman capable of talking about,,,,,,Rachel
 That is so cool.,,,,,,Rachel
" (sarcastic) Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.",,,,,,Rachel
 (approaching) Hey! ,,,,,,Rachel
 Ross gave it to me.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, thank you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!",,,,,,Rachel
 (to Monica) Allll done!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, who’s next?! (She looks around the room, and stops when",,,,,,Rachel
" Come on, please?! I’m boredddd! You let me do it once before.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes! (she starts creeping up on him),,,,,,Rachel
 Just once! ,,,,,,Rachel
" Take it like a man, Ross!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, come on!",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah.",,,,,,Rachel
" (reading a card) Okay, your band is playing at Arnold’s,",,,,,,Rachel
" (getting up) All right, I’m gonna make more margaritas! (She",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m just making margaritas.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?! ,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, come on!",,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, please?",,,,,,Rachel
" (pause) He is, isn’t he? I don’t know, I don’t know, I mean",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn’t up yet. Did you guys",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, great.",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m going for a walk.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, ah nothin’. I just felt like hangin’ out here and reading.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh-ha-ha!,,,,,,Rachel
" Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh!,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?!,,,,,,Rachel
 I mean you definitely should do that.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
" Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!",,,,,,Rachel
" Aww Pheebs, that sucks!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Come on see, she doesn’t look that bad.",,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t know.,,,,,,Rachel
" All right! Ross, do you think it’s easy for me to see you with",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving",,,,,,Rachel
 Noo.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!",,,,,,Rachel
" Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know. Ross, I still can’t forgive you",,,,,,Rachel
" I just, I feel, I-I just...",,,,,,Rachel
 I feel...,,,,,,Rachel
 Well! Good night. (to Ross) I’m going upstairs.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you’re welcome a million.",,,,,,Rachel
 (softly) Oh my God.,,,,,,Rachel
 Whoa! What?! Why?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Here?! Now?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, can’t you tell her that you are not in the mood?",,,,,,Rachel
 (interrupting) Whoa-ho.,,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t know.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, making it worse!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, was it awful?",,,,,,Rachel
 I wrote you a letter.,,,,,,Rachel
" (handing him the letter) It’s just some things I’ve been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I’ll be waiting for you, just come up when you’re done.",,,,,,Rachel
" (coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts the letter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why didn’t you come up?",,,,,,Rachel
 You just finished?,,,,,,Rachel
" So umm, does it?",,,,,,Rachel
 Does it?,,,,,,Rachel
" What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even think about it...",,,,,,Rachel
 Are you sure?,,,,,,Rachel
 I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from the letter.),,,,,,Rachel
 How was the beach?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, that’s it, you guys! What happened out there?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh-hooo, I missed you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?",,,,,,Rachel
" You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!!,,,,,,Rachel
 You fell asleep?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you’re at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!",,,,,,Rachel
 (to Monica) Sorry!! (to Ross) I just feel bad about all that sleep you’re gonna miss wishing you were with me!,,,,,,Rachel
" And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!",,,,,,Rachel
" Good! ‘Cause I’ve got a product report to read, it’s like eight pages, I hope I don’t fall asleep.",,,,,,Rachel
" (sees Chip’s phone number) Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?",,,,,,Rachel
 (interrupting) I bet he sensed that I was ready to have s*x with another guy.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. (picks up phone) Are you sure you wanna hear this?,,,,,,Rachel
" (on phone) Chip! Hi, it’s Rachel. (listens) Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. (listens) Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. (listens) Monica Geller. (listens) Ohh.",,,,,,Rachel
 Why? I love that thing.,,,,,,Rachel
 Something to do with numbers?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you’re going out with Chip Matthews?",,,,,,Rachel
 Nooo! It’s not okay! I can’t believe you would want to after what he did to me!,,,,,,Rachel
 Monica! I couldn’t find him for two hours! He was having s*x with Amy Welch!,,,,,,Rachel
" I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school.",,,,,,Rachel
 (shocked) They had to have that specially made?!,,,,,,Rachel
" (stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her) ",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. Just, if it’s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have s*x with another guy?",,,,,,Rachel
 I believe it.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, I do.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.",,,,,,Rachel
 Jurassic Park could happen.,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) You guys, you’re never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! (She’s holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?",,,,,,Rachel
" You guys, there’s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Do we have to tell her?,,,,,,Rachel
 I hate when Ross is right!,,,,,,Rachel
 Pheebs...,,,,,,Rachel
 All right!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Jeez!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hello, Chip.",,,,,,Rachel
" I’m great! I’m great. I’ve got a great job at Bloomingdale’s, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I’m not seeing anyone right now, I’ve never felt better about myself.",,,,,,Rachel
" She’ll be out in a second. So, Chip, how’s umm, Amy Welch?",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.,,,,,,Rachel
" (to Monica) So, how was your date?",,,,,,Rachel
 Um-hmm.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh honey, I’m sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! That’s so great!,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m sorry, sweetie. (shows her the flyer)",,,,,,Rachel
 You could.... say you’re sorry to her mom.,,,,,,Rachel
" So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?",,,,,,Rachel
 I’ll go with you.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game.",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?",,,,,,Rachel
" My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward.",,,,,,Rachel
" (laughs) You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you?",,,,,,Rachel
 What is she doing here?,,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler!! (He turns around quickly) Promise me, you will end it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
" That’s weird, she locked the door.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list?",,,,,,Rachel
 (answering it) (angrily) What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 You promised you would break up with her!,,,,,,Rachel
 And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! (Grabs the key) You never see Joanna again!",,,,,,Rachel
 You never come into this office again!,,,,,,Rachel
 You give me back my Walkman!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!",,,,,,Rachel
 Does it hurt?,,,,,,Rachel
 Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?,,,,,,Rachel
" When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired!",,,,,,Rachel
" No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were! (She tries to drag him over to the chair, but Chandler stops her.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why.",,,,,,Rachel
 What if I clean your bathroom for a month?,,,,,,Rachel
 Foot rubs for a month!,,,,,,Rachel
 I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!,,,,,,Rachel
 Sophie sit!!,,,,,,Rachel
" No! God, would you just calm down!",,,,,,Rachel
" I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.",,,,,,Rachel
 I ah… Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!,,,,,,Rachel
 (happily) Yeah!!,,,,,,Rachel
 D’oh!! (pause) I’ve got it!,,,,,,Rachel
" I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous (Holds her hands far apart) or very (In a high pitched voice) stingy.",,,,,,Rachel
 I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, not compared to you. (Chandler nods in agreement)",,,,,,Rachel
 So did you break up with Joanna?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 It’s me! Good morning!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, so I… (Enters Joanna’s office and sees her handcuffed to her chair wearing nothing but a slip) Oh my word!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah! Yeah!",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I thought you liked doing it. (Rachel starts out the door and stops.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Right!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ummm. Oh! I’m sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.) It’s a little old but…,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.,,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
 I didn’t… I never said that.,,,,,,Rachel
" (starting to cry) Okay, I’m sorry. (Runs out still carrying the pizza box.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.,,,,,,Rachel
" That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! My hero! What happened?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?! You got us evicted!!,,,,,,Rachel
 That’s not true! (Starts to cry.),,,,,,Rachel
 Go!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, why doesn’t he practice with a girl?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that…garbage chute. (Starts to cry)",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey! So, did you quit?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, umm, I was just y’know working out and umm… Oh, that’s it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Where?!,,,,,,Rachel
 (laughing) What was that?,,,,,,Rachel
 You just did a little dancy thing.,,,,,,Rachel
 You are soo enjoying this.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.",,,,,,Rachel
 What are you ever gonna use that for?!,,,,,,Rachel
 You got fired?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Sweety...,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
" May fifth, why?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, have fun!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, she's...",,,,,,Rachel
 You love her.,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering, with a guy) Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. (He starts to leave, and Rachel grabs him and gives him a passionate kiss.) I'll miss you.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.",,,,,,Rachel
" Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?",,,,,,Rachel
 What was that?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. (She tries to walk away from Josh, by he keeps holding her) Stop it!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! (Monica gives a sarcastic thumbs up) (Josh leaves) I am soo gonna marry that guy. (looking in her wallet) Ohhh!,,,,,,Rachel
 I think he's stealing from me.,,,,,,Rachel
 Because he's stealing from me!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ughh! (Storms out after him),,,,,,Rachel
 Well where's Amanda?,,,,,,Rachel
" I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.",,,,,,Rachel
" Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.",,,,,,Rachel
" (laughing) Ohh, that is soo sad.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it! (Shows her, her ring)",,,,,,Rachel
 Sorry.,,,,,,Rachel
 Y'know...,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 No!,,,,,,Rachel
 (confused) Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 (really confused) Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?",,,,,,Rachel
 Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!",,,,,,Rachel
" Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, honey, that's so sweet.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! What happened?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.",,,,,,Rachel
" And not one of your coupons for an hour of ""Joey Love.""",,,,,,Rachel
" No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, how'd it go?",,,,,,Rachel
 You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.,,,,,,Rachel
 And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?,,,,,,Rachel
 No....,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes! Rent!,,,,,,Rachel
" What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.",,,,,,Rachel
 What did you get her? (Joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up a pen.),,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?",,,,,,Rachel
 Any luck?,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.",,,,,,Rachel
" Aw, honey, that's so sweet.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! Pathetic! (Grabs the crossword puzzle and starts writing.),,,,,,Rachel
 I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!",,,,,,Rachel
 Thanks!,,,,,,Rachel
" Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I can’t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.",,,,,,Rachel
 Why not?,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, Phoebe you’re… awful!",,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I remember that!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, Chandler, you’re gonna have to tell him.",,,,,,Rachel
 Because you do.,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 So are things with you and Joey any better?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?",,,,,,Rachel
 You shouldn’t.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I’m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just… (goes into her bedroom.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!,,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, so cute, that I’m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know, it’s sick.",,,,,,Rachel
 Because it’s Richard’s son! It’s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!,,,,,,Rachel
 Is he okay in there?,,,,,,Rachel
" So now, what exactly is the point of the box?",,,,,,Rachel
 (worried) Why?,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. (She goes into her bedroom),,,,,,Rachel
 (coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.,,,,,,Rachel
" Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?,,,,,,Rachel
 Credit.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, I like those sunglasses.",,,,,,Rachel
" (Swears in Italian, it’s the same term used by Joey earlier and Joey nods his approval.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Fancy soap? I thought we were savin’ that for the Pope!,,,,,,Rachel
 (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, can you pass me the yams?",,,,,,Rachel
 Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)",,,,,,Rachel
" Don’t say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross what’s in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the museum from the first time we… were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, had reasons.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, he sees her!",,,,,,Rachel
 No?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There’s an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss…",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and…",,,,,,Rachel
" God, I am so glad you don’t have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn’t even consider applying.",,,,,,Rachel
 (interrupting) And that’s I’m so glad… there’s no problem.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! That’s great!,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I, umm…",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.",,,,,,Rachel
" I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, I realize that…",,,,,,Rachel
 I love working with designers!,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering Joanna’s office) Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.",,,,,,Rachel
" No! It didn’t! That’s what I want to talk to you about. (starts to break up) Now, just to brief you… (starts to cry) I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.",,,,,,Rachel
 There’s nobody here!,,,,,,Rachel
 Do you want me to quit?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y’know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, (She goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk, which amount to a muffin and a pen) and I will be gone by the end of the day! (Realizes she has nothing.) Well, I guess there’s no use to me sticking around ‘til the end of the day! (Starts to leave.)",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 My drinking?,,,,,,Rachel
 Said what? Exactly.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I’m leaving! You are just a horrible person!",,,,,,Rachel
 Say more things like that.,,,,,,Rachel
 I’d need an expense account.,,,,,,Rachel
 And an assistant.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I’m soo happy!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, you’ve waited soo long.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.",,,,,,Rachel
 How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale’s?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes!!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, it’s gonna be so great! I’m gonna get to help decide what we sell, I’m gonna have an office with walls and everything. (turns to Monica) I’m gonna have walls!",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m an assistant buyer!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?",,,,,,Rachel
 Heard what?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! How?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, God. Oh, God. (gets worried) Oh God.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn’t hear about Joanna…",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day, then my birthday, then bang!—before you know it, they’re lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! (hearing this, Gunther moves in) Y’know, I want a man!! (Gunther leaves depressed) I mean, it doesn’t even have to be a big relationship, y’know, just like a fling would be great.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve been single. How come you never offered this before?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don’t like guys with boring jobs.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, honey! What’s the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell at them? Or, fire them?",,,,,,Rachel
" Pheebs, that’s great!",,,,,,Rachel
" But y’know umm, Rachel doesn’t rhyme with draddle.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?!,,,,,,Rachel
" So, will I like any of these guys?",,,,,,Rachel
 Chandler!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, I like swimmer’s bodies!",,,,,,Rachel
" Op, I like credit cards!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, so what does he do?",,,,,,Rachel
 Your company has a fine foods division?,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!,,,,,,Rachel
 Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didn’t tell him that, though? Right?",,,,,,Rachel
 You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh, he’s so gonna get the wrong idea.",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?",,,,,,Rachel
 You idiot!!,,,,,,Rachel
 You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!,,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
 Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.),,,,,,Rachel
" What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Well you said *black*. Why would he want his blue blazer black?,,,,,,Rachel
 Don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?,,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, this is really an incredible thing to do for them but there are things to think about.",,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, I don't know if I could ever do that. You know, I always figured the first time I had a baby, it would be with someone I love and that baby would be like, a keeper.",,,,,,Rachel
 Why don't you talk to someone who's had a baby. Like your mom.,,,,,,Rachel
" I am so jealous. You guys are just, really, right *there*, aren't you?",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, that is so nice.",,,,,,Rachel
" Why, just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, when we're in the audience, he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, not for girls anyway. Guys agree [snaps her fingers] like that.",,,,,,Rachel
 Let me see that. [looks at the drawing] Oh yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you know, sometimes that helps.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Matterhorn.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, TOES!! [raises hands in air. They both look at her.] Yeah, for some people.",,,,,,Rachel
 [sadly] Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" [looking away] Oh, I can't watch this. It's like ""Sophie's Choice.""",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it was only okay.",,,,,,Rachel
 Depends who asked.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Mon. Sure.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes.,,,,,,Rachel
" You're not asking me, are you?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, totally.",,,,,,Rachel
" What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is that you? (Monica nods her head no, and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.) Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joey’s with Monica in trail.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on their door.) Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!",,,,,,Rachel
 What is that noise?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I’ve been up since six. Thanks to somebody’s dumb-ass rooster.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.,,,,,,Rachel
 How many guesses do you get?,,,,,,Rachel
 No! There’s no orange juice in there! We win!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, well, we won that one.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.",,,,,,Rachel
 Fine! We’ll ask Phoebe.,,,,,,Rachel
" I know! I know, it’s such a huge, life-altering thing.",,,,,,Rachel
 Tails!,,,,,,Rachel
 We’ll take Literature!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Chandler gets it! It’s Chandler Bing!,,,,,,Rachel
 (shouting) It’s All Relative!!,,,,,,Rachel
 (shouting) I’m sorry!,,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, I don’t want to lose 200 dollars.",,,,,,Rachel
 Monica?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, so let’s play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oooohh that’s interesting.,,,,,,Rachel
 Throw in the duck too!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, he gets the other one all riled up.",,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, betting the apartment, I don’t know about this.",,,,,,Rachel
 Why? Do you have the answers written on there?,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, let’s do it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. (They go into the living room.),,,,,,Rachel
 All right!,,,,,,Rachel
 14?,,,,,,Rachel
 Space cowboy!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.",,,,,,Rachel
 He carries a briefcase.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God.,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering from Chandler’s bedroom, I guess, and sees the foosball table.) Oh my God! I can’t believe you guys are actually think you’re moving in here!",,,,,,Rachel
 Well I-I-I’m not moving.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!",,,,,,Rachel
 Noooo.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t care, I’m not going anywhere.",,,,,,Rachel
" No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl’s apartment! That is a boy’s apartment, it’s dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It’s-it’s so pretty! And look, and it’s-it’s purple! And I’m telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand. (She holds out her hand, which is shaking uncontrollably.)",,,,,,Rachel
 That’s right! You do what the hand says!,,,,,,Rachel
 How did it go?,,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!",,,,,,Rachel
 That is not true. She did! She forced me!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well it stupid, unfair question!",,,,,,Rachel
 Will you stop calling it your apartment!,,,,,,Rachel
 No it’s not!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I think I saw some in here.",,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it’ll die.",,,,,,Rachel
 Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps),,,,,,Rachel
" No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!",,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh.,,,,,,Rachel
" (on the phone) Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! (Pause) I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I’m so sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, at least that’s a great suit.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" No-no, that wasn’t me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way. (Motions to the correct way.)",,,,,,Rachel
" I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi-e!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.",,,,,,Rachel
 It’s Joshua.,,,,,,Rachel
" Why? Honey, what is the big deal?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, that’s true.",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, what did she say?",,,,,,Rachel
 Beefsteak Charlie’s?,,,,,,Rachel
" Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey’s.) Oh, hey, do you need help with that?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and Joey’s.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It’s just so frustrating!",,,,,,Rachel
 Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hmm-mmm.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before.",,,,,,Rachel
 No. Have you?,,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t even know how I would go about it.,,,,,,Rachel
" You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, and I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin’? (Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s. (Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we—(Listens) the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let’s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I’ll see you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) You’ve done that a thousand times?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?! You think that will work?,,,,,,Rachel
" Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too… (Tries again.) Umm, who likes the Knicks—(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how they would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like it?",,,,,,Rachel
 Great.,,,,,,Rachel
 Sure.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah-eah-ha!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh well, you don’t want to do that now?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Basketball!,,,,,,Rachel
" I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re interested, just as a thank you for this week.",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
" I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.",,,,,,Rachel
" He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got the date, I’m just not on it!",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! Monica!,,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs, and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I’m glad. Rachel, I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?",,,,,,Rachel
 How does going to a strip club help him better?,,,,,,Rachel
 Um-hmm. (Joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves Rachel staring at his ass.) There we go. There it is.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, okay. Uhh, well let’s see. (Grabs his hand.) You’re about—well uh, this one is large. And this one—(Grabs the other hand.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes.,,,,,,Rachel
 Sure. You got it. Great!,,,,,,Rachel
" Me, Fladermouse, great. I really—(motions to Joshua.)",,,,,,Rachel
" So? (She puts her hands in his, totally forgetting about the gloves, and hoping for something more intimate.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I’ll be right back!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
 No! Nothing!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! That would be great!,,,,,,Rachel
" (shocked) Well, I-I guess—I…",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, great, you betcha!",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. Oh, right.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yay!,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, Monica!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, it’s Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So… What are you gonna do?",,,,,,Rachel
 No! Help me!,,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ugh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is—I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y’know the ""Wouldn’t it be great if she was my wife"" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! (Realises that Ross is in the room.) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 So….,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohhhh, come on!!!",,,,,,Rachel
" No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!",,,,,,Rachel
" I’ll be right there! (to Ross) Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we’ve gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! (Monica opens the door.) Emily?",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m Rachel Green.,,,,,,Rachel
 There’s been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I’m not free tonight. So…,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh well, no I…",,,,,,Rachel
 I’ll get her.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey—whoa, slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No, keep moving. (Joey runs off.) Wow!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I didn’t see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.",,,,,,Rachel
" The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, ""I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!"" and he let her right in.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, that’s you’re name.",,,,,,Rachel
 What? Who the hell is Emily—(realises) noooo!!,,,,,,Rachel
 They’re in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her arms franticly and hits Chandler.),,,,,,Rachel
 How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hits Chandler again.),,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler, yet again.)",,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t care! All right, y’know what I’m just upset that I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, y’know, would you just for once, not remember every…little…thing!! (Storms out.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (joining them) Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call. I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) I can’t believe it! He still hasn’t called.,,,,,,Rachel
 It’s Joshua.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, I don’t.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, come on! What’s going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)",,,,,,Rachel
" See, I don’t know, for me it would have to Chantal.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, are we all together? Like in a group?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hey!",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hmm.",,,,,,Rachel
 Joshua.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I…",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, thank goodness!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, no problem. I’m so glad I could help. Happy for you. (She playfully punches him.)",,,,,,Rachel
" No, happy for you! (Hits him harder.)",,,,,,Rachel
" No-no-no, that’ not Joshua.",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, there’s a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you less of a guy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does! (Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hmm.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, here’s another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?",,,,,,Rachel
 Guess who we ran into today?!,,,,,,Rachel
 You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering, with Joey) Hey!",,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know, you-you also could’ve used uh, lamps and then followed the light.",,,,,,Rachel
 It’s coming from Joey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.",,,,,,Rachel
" (starts laughing, Ross stares at her) I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You’re right, you are a tough guy. You’re the toughest palaeontologist I know.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him.",,,,,,Rachel
" You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?",,,,,,Rachel
 No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.,,,,,,Rachel
 (refers to the table) What are these?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! If only more people knew.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 (noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that weren’t there originally.) What-what are-what are these?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! Look at this!,,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!,,,,,,Rachel
 And did you?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank God.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, here’s that trench-coat that you wanted.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
" (stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they don’t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, that’s because of a lot of…(She imitates someone picking their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)",,,,,,Rachel
 I know!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, congratulations, so do you love her?",,,,,,Rachel
" Huh. Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting. (She goes over and retrieves her note.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device.",,,,,,Rachel
" You need that, you need that too ‘cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up. (Rips up the note.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.",,,,,,Rachel
" We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said he’s not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Surprise!!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, it was all Ross’s idea.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he’s looking over here, say something funny.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, y’know what, y’know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!",,,,,,Rachel
 Care for a cherry?,,,,,,Rachel
" No? Y’know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?",,,,,,Rachel
 Up!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, God! Look at him, he’s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 It’s not Christmas!,,,,,,Rachel
 He’s not 11!,,,,,,Rachel
 What? You’re leaving?!,,,,,,Rachel
" No! You guys can’t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!",,,,,,Rachel
" (spinning the bottle) So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther’s face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yay! Emily!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, my turn!!",,,,,,Rachel
" It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once, it’ll kick again!",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.",,,,,,Rachel
 Just a bug.,,,,,,Rachel
" No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an ‘E!’",,,,,,Rachel
 Gimme an ‘M!’,,,,,,Rachel
 Gimme an ‘I!’,,,,,,Rachel
 Gimme an ‘L!’,,,,,,Rachel
 Gimme a ‘Y!’,,,,,,Rachel
 What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) Emil—Whoa!! (She falls in Chandler’s room.) Okay! So that’s me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunther’s the only one that claps.),,,,,,Rachel
" I’m fine! I’m fine! I’m just losing a tooth, it’s no big deal. I have a dentist! Y’know. I’m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. (She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do now?",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, come on, let’s go get your coat.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Y’know, this bra… Really, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Y’know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y’know what they’d say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isn’t co-operating.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.",,,,,,Rachel
" Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them!",,,,,,Rachel
 Why?!,,,,,,Rachel
 You like me?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can’t believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no, but’s never good! Let’s just leave it at, you like me and I like you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, now see that’s a fancy but.",,,,,,Rachel
 But….,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Ross, I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.",,,,,,Rachel
 Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m so sorry.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, maybe you didn’t want it to end?",,,,,,Rachel
 You seem to really like her.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" You’re a pathetic loser, right?",,,,,,Rachel
 Sit!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my gosh, Joshua!",,,,,,Rachel
 They’re not true?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Oh, I love that but.",,,,,,Rachel
 You wanna go inside and have some coffee?,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. (Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.) Every time.,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, what are you doing? That’s too heavy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica right away.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Is that the heartbeat?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh wow! This is so cool.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!",,,,,,Rachel
 What’s that song? It has been in my head all day long.,,,,,,Rachel
 Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes!,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. (As she exits, Phoebe enters.) Hey, Pheebs!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, what-what ‘cha got there?",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised…",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 (interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, well I can up with it!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I…",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, it’s not Relaxi Cab. It’s Relaxicab, like taxicab.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (She’s holding two frilly, lace nighties.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal.,,,,,,Rachel
 What am I making him by the way?,,,,,,Rachel
 I thought I was making him filet mignon?,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!",,,,,,Rachel
 (taking a bite) Hmmm!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh I know, my God, this is so—this rice is so—I am so good.",,,,,,Rachel
" (sees the chick and the duck) Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.",,,,,,Rachel
" All gone! So, farm birds, huh?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. So, can I serve you a little of—What? What? What? (She sees that Joshua isn’t relaxed.)",,,,,,Rachel
" But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.",,,,,,Rachel
 Your parents’?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah that works.,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! This place is fabulous!,,,,,,Rachel
" Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must’ve been a real babe magnet.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?",,,,,,Rachel
" That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?",,,,,,Rachel
 Ah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi you!,,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I can do more than cook.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! It’s so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes their hands.) Hello.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hello.,,,,,,Rachel
" What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not—that’s-that’s not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It’s-it’s, they’re-they’re wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s, so… And obviously in uh, in-in this case, (She grabs a pen and paper) I am going to report back, ""USA not ready.""",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, we were going to do that after—I mean umm, next.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah, well… Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin’ around the house.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, it’s all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod there heads in agreement.)",,,,,,Rachel
 So?,,,,,,Rachel
 Huh.,,,,,,Rachel
" She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.",,,,,,Rachel
 Absolutely! Absolutely!,,,,,,Rachel
" What—yeah—what, y’know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.",,,,,,Rachel
 HEY!! Do you have to do that? It’s Saturday!,,,,,,Rachel
 I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!,,,,,,Rachel
 Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.,,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, you don’t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" So—Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Do you guys want these?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, well you got ‘em.",,,,,,Rachel
 Just give us our apartment back!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.",,,,,,Rachel
 You’re bachelor pad?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Or I’ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?",,,,,,Rachel
 Let me finish.,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m talking about a bet, winner takes all.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she’s the only who’s impartial, and she’s so pretty.",,,,,,Rachel
 What? Shut up! We’re winning!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, cut, let’s pick again, pick again.",,,,,,Rachel
 Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen is high!,,,,,,Rachel
 We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.),,,,,,Rachel
" All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.",,,,,,Rachel
 Let us keep the apartment and…,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I-I heard. (Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for Rachel’s reaction.) I think it’s great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, I’m so happy for you!",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! It’s you. (She stops doing the dishes.) Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so…",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I’m okay.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that’s sweet.",,,,,,Rachel
" (breaking the hug) Uhh, hang in there?",,,,,,Rachel
 I mean maybe you didn’t hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has—yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y’know, emotionally, mentally, physically…",,,,,,Rachel
 I know isn’t it? It’s like I’m right there with Joshua.,,,,,,Rachel
" You are right there with Emily. And it’s y’know, it’s kinda like…. it’s a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah? Fine.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, no, what’s that?",,,,,,Rachel
 That would be great!,,,,,,Rachel
 (to the closed door) Hang in there. You hang in there. (Gives him the raspberry.),,,,,,Rachel
" No, just singing. (Does a little song.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There’s nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua. Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway!",,,,,,Rachel
" Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous! I mean, they’re gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off. I’m telling ya, you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re dancing at there’s.",,,,,,Rachel
 Why not?,,,,,,Rachel
 Nothing.,,,,,,Rachel
 In a month?,,,,,,Rachel
" You mean, you mean 30 days?",,,,,,Rachel
 From now?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, that’s great.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. (Hugs him) See you.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! (She sits down) Sit!,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?",,,,,,Rachel
" ‘Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y’know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y’know?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah-yeah, y’know if-if there was just like one little area where I—that I think we need—we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we’re just not crazy enough!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, yeah, right, y’know what? Yeah, you’re right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if (Grunts uncomprehensively)……I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y’know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y’know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I know, I know, it’s-it’s so, it’s so totally like, ""Whoa! Can we do this?"" Y’know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don’t you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don’t you think?",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering from her bedroom) Well, I just called Joshua…",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.",,,,,,Rachel
 And I-I am just trying to figure out why.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.",,,,,,Rachel
 Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there.,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, apparently he scares easy.",,,,,,Rachel
" It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’d thought they would.",,,,,,Rachel
" (breaking the hug) Oh, hey, don’t you have to go pick up Emily?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! I got my girls.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebe’s lap.),,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, okay! (She goes to answer the door.)",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m not gonna marry Chandler!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, you guys, just relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as she does, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that it’s Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on the door.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, that oughta do it.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, sure!",,,,,,Rachel
 I knew.,,,,,,Rachel
 I did.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, maybe...",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]",,,,,,Rachel
 OK.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind Ross],,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross] Look at it!",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!",,,,,,Rachel
 [to Ross] Yes! Did you see that?,,,,,,Rachel
 I could not have done this without you.,,,,,,Rachel
 [hurt] What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?",,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.,,,,,,Rachel
 Good. [Ross leaves],,,,,,Rachel
 Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...,,,,,,Rachel
 Well neither do I!,,,,,,Rachel
 (shocked) Oh my God.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.",,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.",,,,,,Rachel
 No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.",,,,,,Rachel
 So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?,,,,,,Rachel
" (opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! ",,,,,,Rachel
 Just get out! Now!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay! All right! How was she?,,,,,,Rachel
 Was she good?,,,,,,Rachel
" Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she?",,,,,,Rachel
 Good different?,,,,,,Rachel
"  ...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?  I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”  Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...",,,,,,Rachel
 You seem to really like her.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hey guys! What’s up?,,,,,,Rachel
 What’s this? Is this Ross’s wedding invitation?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don’t have to do that! I’m happy for him! I am! I really—I’m-I’m happ—I’ll work on it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, honey, I don’t know. I…",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I’ll think about it. Yeah.",,,,,,Rachel
 Who's this from?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh... [opens it]... [sees it is a pin] Oh my God. He remembered.,,,,,,Rachel
" It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!",,,,,,Rachel
 What did you just say?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.... my God.,,,,,,Rachel
  (seeing Ross come off the plane with another woman.) Oh my God.,,,,,,Rachel
" Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?",,,,,,Rachel
  She didn't hang up either...,,,,,,Rachel
" [on phone] Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat...(cut)...I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. [hangs up and tosses phone in the ice bucket]",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . [jumps the couch and lands on Ross's back, finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expression on his face.]",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohhhhhhhh God. [climbs off his back],,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, ohh.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, god.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!",,,,,,Rachel
 Noo.,,,,,,Rachel
" Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know.",,,,,,Rachel
" I just, I feel, I-I just...",,,,,,Rachel
 Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!,,,,,,Rachel
" And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. It’s just gonna be too hard. Y’know? I mean, it’s Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y’know it’s just, it’s for the best, y’know it is, it’s… Y’know, plus, somebody’s got to stay here with Phoebe! Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.",,,,,,Rachel
" So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?",,,,,,Rachel
" Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hormones!,,,,,,Rachel
 Nooo!,,,,,,Rachel
 All right fine! You’re not invited to the party we’re gonna have either.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well umm…,,,,,,Rachel
 Little village people.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that is so sweet!",,,,,,Rachel
" Huh. Except, Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she’s always wanted!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe’s way.),,,,,,Rachel
 No we…,,,,,,Rachel
" …hormones, yeah.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross’s wedding.",,,,,,Rachel
" It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, h-how is this like that?",,,,,,Rachel
" (starting to cry) I’m-I’m sorry, I just thought that…",,,,,,Rachel
 Good.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.),,,,,,Rachel
 You what?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay. Y’know what? It’s okay. I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!,,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t know!,,,,,,Rachel
 I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, really. Really, Pheebs, you’re not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they’re bad, y’know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. Y’know?",,,,,,Rachel
 And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!,,,,,,Rachel
" And y’know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Who are you saying ""check"" too?",,,,,,Rachel
 Have fun!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I know.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, well, I gotta work, I’m sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
" Because, I can’t! Ross, I told you, no. I can’t.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, honey! Don’t get up! What do you need?",,,,,,Rachel
 Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, that is all you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I don’t know. I guess we have to eat.",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.,,,,,,Rachel
 (interrupting) Still in love with?!,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m not in love with Ross!,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I’m still in love with him! I mean, hey, y’know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y’know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don’t mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him. Y’know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him—Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my—why didn’t you tell me?!!",,,,,,Rachel
 We?!,,,,,,Rachel
 You all know? Does Ross know?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I can not believe you didn’t tell me!",,,,,,Rachel
 (depressed) Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
 Manhattan does not have enough stores.,,,,,,Rachel
 You can?,,,,,,Rachel
 Um-hmm.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?",,,,,,Rachel
 I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.,,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 All right.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ow!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I like you less!",,,,,,Rachel
 Pheebs?,,,,,,Rachel
 Do you remember where the duck food is?,,,,,,Rachel
 (enters with a bag packed) Because I’m going to London.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don’t have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh—Do you think he will?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says, ""I do."" (Exits)",,,,,,Rachel
" (Running to the ticket counter) Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. (Slightly out of breath) Hi.",,,,,,Rachel
" (Faking cheerfulness.) Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, good.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.",,,,,,Rachel
" (looking through her wallet.) Ohh, I just don’t think I have enough left on my credit card.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, okay, how about five. (She hands her all the credit cards.) Ohh, thank you.",,,,,,Rachel
" (Looking through her purse.) Okay, you know what? I don’t have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty. (She slides it across the counter.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (Running to her room.) Hi, Pheebs.",,,,,,Rachel
" (Running back out the door with her passport.) Bye, Pheebs.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, I’m back. Listen, I need to...",,,,,,Rachel
 Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, you know what/ You’re going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.",,,,,,Rachel
" Sure, you know what? Come on, we’ll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the ""engine"".",,,,,,Rachel
" Look, If I don’t get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!! (She pounds her hand on the counter twice. The ticket agent counters by placing the closed sign on the counter and tapping it twice.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohhh.(she rhythmically taps her hands on the magazine on her lap.),,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. I’m sorry. I’m very sorry. Sorry. (She hums and sighs happily.) It’s just, I’m ahh, I’m kinda excited. I’m, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and... (He puts his headphones on to ignore her.)",,,,,,Rachel
" ...And so then I realized. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn’t come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...",,,,,,Rachel
" Ehh, pardon me?",,,,,,Rachel
 But he has to know how I feel!,,,,,,Rachel
 (Sighing) Well I-I think your wrong.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well I just came...(She touches him near his heart. She’s almost in tears.) I just needed to tell you...(Looking into his eyes. She takes a deep breath.) Congratulations. (He hugs her. She can barely hold back the tears.),,,,,,Rachel
" (To the woman sitting in front of her) He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?",,,,,,Rachel
" Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can’t pretend that didn’t happen can I?",,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, what should I do?",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Whoa, wait, listen, I think I’m just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, you’re right. You’re right. You can’t help me.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hi!",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi. Sorry, things aren’t working out so well.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she’s gonna get over this, y’know? I mean, so you said my name! Y’know you just said it ‘cause you saw me there, if you’d have seen a circus freak, you would’ve said, ""I take thee circus freak."" Y’know, it didn’t mean anything, it’s just a mistake. It didn’t mean anything. Right?",,,,,,Rachel
 Right…,,,,,,Rachel
" (laughs) Y’know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.",,,,,,Rachel
" Get the hell out of there, y’know?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, look at that, same thing.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! (They both just stare at her.) Okay, don’t believe me, I know I’m right—do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hello? Oh, Pheebs! (To them) It’s Phoebe!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, Ross said my name.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, Pheebs, y’know what, let’s look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then…",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there’s a whole cart outside… (Sees the Walthams and stops.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (she stops and turns) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I-I-I’ve been on Standby for a flight home for hours.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?",,,,,,Rachel
" So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. I’m sorry.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, you’re not an idiot, Ross. You’re a guy very much in love.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, you know what, I think you should go.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it’d be really good.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Good!,,,,,,Rachel
 Right!,,,,,,Rachel
 Right!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, I’ll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.",,,,,,Rachel
" What? Wait, what?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well-well, I don’t know Ross—really?",,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay!,,,,,,Rachel
 All right!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, okay, we’re going. Yeah.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, wait-wait-wait…",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. Wait! Wait!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, (points to Ross’s seat.) he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! (Looks out the window.) Hey, look at that, the airport’s moving. (Realizes that that’s not how it works.) Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we’re moving? (Sits back in defeat.) Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.",,,,,,Rachel
" Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. (Goes and puts her luggage away.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, you're the best.",,,,,,Rachel
" What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, ""Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?"" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.",,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.",,,,,,Rachel
" That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't--I still can't believe it. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)",,,,,,Rachel
" I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest of the pictures)…",,,,,,Rachel
 …I mean it's my fault.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! (She licks the top picture and hands them back.),,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda…",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I don't know. I don't know.",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well…,,,,,,Rachel
 That's not European!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God, I really had a good time!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.",,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, hi!",,,,,,Rachel
 Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.,,,,,,Rachel
 What's that? (Points to the box.),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, honey that's awful.",,,,,,Rachel
" But, it's not raining.",,,,,,Rachel
" Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!",,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for the dropped socks.),,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! You did not drop any socks!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted…tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.",,,,,,Rachel
 Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well… (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry and throws it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the door. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)",,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, then talk!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes!,,,,,,Rachel
 I'm gonna do it.,,,,,,Rachel
 But I…,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, fine.",,,,,,Rachel
" (stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just--y'know--stop it!",,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, woo!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I-I don't care.",,,,,,Rachel
 What 'cha readin'?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, what's it about?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, (pause) I'm still in love with you Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
 (Laughing) I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.,,,,,,Rachel
" Because (laughs), because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel (laughs) was like, ""You are such an idiot!""",,,,,,Rachel
" (laughs) I'm sorry, that's not funny.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?",,,,,,Rachel
" The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?",,,,,,Rachel
 That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. (They hug.),,,,,,Rachel
" High-five, the babies are coming! (They all high-five.)",,,,,,Rachel
 I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!,,,,,,Rachel
 You-you're not wearing a jacket.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.,,,,,,Rachel
 They're male nurses.,,,,,,Rachel
" Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?",,,,,,Rachel
" What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, how do you make that dirty?",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!",,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.",,,,,,Rachel
 Me?!,,,,,,Rachel
 No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!,,,,,,Rachel
" No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.",,,,,,Rachel
 Y'know who I always liked? Mork.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, but umm… Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, this is Dan (points to him), one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. (Mouths ""He's yours."" to her.) Uh Dan, Monica.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, honey, don’t worry. She's gonna make it on time.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, fair enough.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, how does he look? How does he look?",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Hi. (To Phoebe) Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, umm, no honey.",,,,,,Rachel
 So does it really hurt as bad as they say?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi! I just wanna-(sees Monica)-Ahhh!!! Oh my God! (She runs out in horror.) Oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
" Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!",,,,,,Rachel
" (Gasps) That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?",,,,,,Rachel
" Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. (There's a knock on the door.) Maybe that's him. (Goes to answer the door.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Why aren't you guys at the movie?,,,,,,Rachel
" So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",,,,,,Rachel
" So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best s*x she ever had!,,,,,,Rachel
 What-what-what are you gonna do?,,,,,,Rachel
 Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.,,,,,,Rachel
 Chandler! (Pause) Is he?,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!,,,,,,Rachel
 For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.,,,,,,Rachel
" Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!",,,,,,Rachel
 Like what?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to… Hi!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. (The phone starts ringing.) I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. (The phone keeps ringing.) Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Hi, guys!",,,,,,Rachel
 What's going on?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?",,,,,,Rachel
 (going through the mail) Oh look! A letter from my mom.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah! I know.,,,,,,Rachel
 (interrupting) Oh my God! My dog died!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine-(turns over the note)-teen blocks. Oh. (They all come out from Monica's bedroom) Oh my God.",,,,,,Rachel
 It's Le Poo.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah! (Turns to face him.),,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God. (He hands her some tissues.) No! Oh not again! (Wiping her nose.) This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. (She puts her head back.) Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?",,,,,,Rachel
 Sorry. Sorry.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, what's up?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
" That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? (Pause) (Realizes) Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.",,,,,,Rachel
 Storming out!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?",,,,,,Rachel
 That's not Ross!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.",,,,,,Rachel
 (To Joey) Do you even know who Kip is?,,,,,,Rachel
" See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. (To Chandler) He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.",,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe? (She turns her head further away.) I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. (Moves over next to her.) You gotta come with me!,,,,,,Rachel
" Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Ross…",,,,,,Rachel
" No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!",,,,,,Rachel
 I know.,,,,,,Rachel
 I know that too.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, it's in there. (Points to the bathroom.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?",,,,,,Rachel
 I want the little round waffles.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!",,,,,,Rachel
 Arghhhh!!!!!!,,,,,,Rachel
 You guys! You guys!,,,,,,Rachel
" It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!",,,,,,Rachel
" (proud of herself) Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!",,,,,,Rachel
" What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 What? Yeti—I mean Danny?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so…. Y'know.",,,,,,Rachel
 (shocked) What?,,,,,,Rachel
 What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!,,,,,,Rachel
" So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.",,,,,,Rachel
 And stop saying that! I hate that!,,,,,,Rachel
 Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.",,,,,,Rachel
 That yeti is one smooth talker.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.",,,,,,Rachel
" Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really… I don't mind.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, I…",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.",,,,,,Rachel
 I haven't seen him in so long!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you. (To Monica) Mon?,,,,,,Rachel
 How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.",,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi Danny! (Notices his box of liquor he's carrying.) Wow! Thirsty huh?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, great!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" (laughs) Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.",,,,,,Rachel
" That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?",,,,,,Rachel
" No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?",,,,,,Rachel
 Exactly.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hi Danny.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.",,,,,,Rachel
" It's a uh, regatta gala.",,,,,,Rachel
" No-no, but I support it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. (Closes the door.) Walked right into that one didn't he?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, ""No!"" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ball? There is no ball.,,,,,,Rachel
 Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.,,,,,,Rachel
 What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, sure. (To Monica) All right, whose court is the ball in now?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, go on! You telling people about me?",,,,,,Rachel
" (laughs) Yeah, okay, at ease solider!",,,,,,Rachel
" No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, ""Nice try.""",,,,,,Rachel
 Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?",,,,,,Rachel
 I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, it wasn't. It was actually the…",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" No, God! Please, let me! (Runs out.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, that we may be able to do.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have s*x.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have s*x with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Then, you will definitely get him back!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! (She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. (To Chandler) Hey, what's up? (She leaves and closes the door behind her.)",,,,,,Rachel
 You brought a carrot?!,,,,,,Rachel
 All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?",,,,,,Rachel
" (waving them in his face) Take 'em! (Joey makes a noise and jumps out of the way.) Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, Pheebs!",,,,,,Rachel
 What are you reading?,,,,,,Rachel
 Honey that sounds like fun.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I read that in high school.",,,,,,Rachel
" (To Phoebe) Sorry I'm late, but I left late.",,,,,,Rachel
" So Pheebs, what is the book about?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about?",,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, honey that was pretty obvious.",,,,,,Rachel
" Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, is what she just said umm—Oh my God. (Looks around the room.) You were actually gonna… (Chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.) (Rachel stares in shock.)",,,,,,Rachel
" And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" (sitting down) So umm, what's this book about?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.",,,,,,Rachel
" Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.",,,,,,Rachel
 Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie!,,,,,,Rachel
 A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering, angrily) Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!",,,,,,Rachel
 That was not funny!,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?",,,,,,Rachel
 (sees the picture) Oh my God! That's Monica!!,,,,,,Rachel
" You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!",,,,,,Rachel
 Joey has got a secret peephole!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!,,,,,,Rachel
 Look! (Shows Ross the picture.),,,,,,Rachel
" Well, what is the truth?",,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, is this true?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?",,,,,,Rachel
 And the video camera?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my god. Ok you guys, there’s Danny. Watch. Just watch this. (He walks past the couch to the counter.) See?! Still pretending he’s not interested. Ohh, he’s coming over. Just pretend like we don’t know him. We’ve forgotten who he is.",,,,,,Rachel
" Thanks, Mon.",,,,,,Rachel
 Monica!!!,,,,,,Rachel
 (Somewhat angrily) Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don’t answer me. (Giggling) I have a date with Danny.,,,,,,Rachel
 I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!",,,,,,Rachel
" No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!",,,,,,Rachel
" She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.",,,,,,Rachel
 So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.,,,,,,Rachel
" You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? (Danny nods, ""Yes."") Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" (not sure what to do) Uh, it was very nice meeting you. (They continue to ignore her.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering from her room) Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, they were very y'know…wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks. (She leaves them to wrestle.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, great!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, see? I told you!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.",,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and…",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's…",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.",,,,,,Rachel
" No-no, they're not very nice people.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of…",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. (Gets up and runs from the apartment.)",,,,,,Rachel
" I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!",,,,,,Rachel
 I'm not reading this!,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 So?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, good point.",,,,,,Rachel
" (To Joey) Happy New Year, Joey!",,,,,,Rachel
 But your divorce isn't even final yet.,,,,,,Rachel
" Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.",,,,,,Rachel
 I don't gossip!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?",,,,,,Rachel
 What? They were like this!,,,,,,Rachel
" I didn’t! Even when I found out…umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it. (Goes into her room.)",,,,,,Rachel
 I think they're very nice.,,,,,,Rachel
" Awful, absolutely awful. (Plus other negative comments from Phoebe and Monica.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering, singing) ""Baddest man in the whole damn town.""",,,,,,Rachel
 Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.),,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Joey, do you have a minute?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!",,,,,,Rachel
 What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?,,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone… (Joey in a childish attempt to not hear what Rachel is about to say, puts his fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. Rachel turns and walks out upon seeing that Joey's not gonna listen, and as she exits Chandler walks in and sees Joey in his current state.)",,,,,,Rachel
 That really is something; that's really cool.,,,,,,Rachel
" Good luck, honey!",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, uh, Joey?",,,,,,Rachel
 Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?,,,,,,Rachel
" I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?",,,,,,Rachel
" (quietly) Yeah. Well. (Pause.) Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 Do you know something?,,,,,,Rachel
 I might know something too.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well then I can't tell you what I know.,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know! (Note: Kudos to Ms. Aniston on the delivery of that line. She said it very quickly and didn't screw up a word. Try it yourself, it ain't that easy.)",,,,,,Rachel
 AND YOU KNOW!!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohhh, yeah, me too.",,,,,,Rachel
 Come on Joey!!!,,,,,,Rachel
 I can't believe you would say that!,,,,,,Rachel
" No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! (She sits next to him on the couch.) Fine I want—I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?",,,,,,Rachel
 Is he romantic with her?,,,,,,Rachel
 Are they in love?,,,,,,Rachel
 You don't know anything.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Pheebs, I don’t think anyone's mad about that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.",,,,,,Rachel
 (To Monica) Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 What's up?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh y'know what, we don’t have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!,,,,,,Rachel
 Nothing! You go!,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, (checks watch) y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if—are you sure there's just not anything else?",,,,,,Rachel
 No! (Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.) If there was I wouldn't tell you.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.,,,,,,Rachel
 There he is!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!",,,,,,Rachel
 You walked around all night in the city by yourself?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ross! Janice?!,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.",,,,,,Rachel
" I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, ""I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."" And he said, ""Laundry? Is that my new nickname?"" And you said, ""No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big.""",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.,,,,,,Rachel
 Sure! Why?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I was actually—I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.,,,,,,Rachel
" That's good enough. Right? (Pause.) Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 'Kay. (Pause.) Congratulations on your new job. (She goes and hugs Monica and is almost in tears.),,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.",,,,,,Rachel
" Sure! (Pause) God, please take those off!",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. (Goes and grabs a bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to Joey.)",,,,,,Rachel
 It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.,,,,,,Rachel
" No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look, men, carrying the bag.",,,,,,Rachel
 Exactly! Unisex!,,,,,,Rachel
 No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, then you owe me $350.",,,,,,Rachel
 (glaring at him) Joey…,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi sweetie!,,,,,,Rachel
 Why?! Why not?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?",,,,,,Rachel
 What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!,,,,,,Rachel
" Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it… (Looks for help.)",,,,,,Rachel
 …I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.,,,,,,Rachel
" Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag, I just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, (Pause) controversial.",,,,,,Rachel
 I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom. (Does so.)",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
 OH MY GOD!!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!,,,,,,Rachel
 I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!",,,,,,Rachel
 (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down) HI!! Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Joey! Come here! Come here!,,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.,,,,,,Rachel
" No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. (Joey gasps) Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.",,,,,,Rachel
 Wh-what do you mean?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.",,,,,,Rachel
 You don't have any secrets!,,,,,,Rachel
" (To Phoebe) So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay great, hold on a sec! (She runs to her room and returns carrying a huge bag of laundry.) Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?,,,,,,Rachel
" All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!",,,,,,Rachel
 Y'know what you should do?,,,,,,Rachel
" You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.",,,,,,Rachel
 (To Ross) See?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, he broke those too.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hello! (Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! (To Phoebe) It's Chandler.,,,,,,Rachel
 Are you kidding?!,,,,,,Rachel
" I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we know?",,,,,,Rachel
 Joey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!",,,,,,Rachel
 All right. Be sexy.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is our friend! (Monica covers her face.) It's Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandler's shoulder.),,,,,,Rachel
 Show time!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay! (She runs to get some.),,,,,,Rachel
" (handing her the wine) Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay? Whoa, wait! (She undoes one button on Phoebe's dress.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, oh wait! (She goes for another one.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay!,,,,,,Rachel
" (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!,,,,,,Rachel
" Aww, Joey, come here. (She takes his hand.) Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?",,,,,,Rachel
" Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.",,,,,,Rachel
 And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.,,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, because she loves you and because you love her.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.",,,,,,Rachel
 Not unless different means the same.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! Wow! You look, you look…big.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey! Hey, cute jacket!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Ow! (Joey motions, ""You see what I mean?!"")",,,,,,Rachel
 Whoa! (Laughs) Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.),,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! (She retaliates.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, you're so sweet! (She kicks Katie in the shin.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! (She doesn't move.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?",,,,,,Rachel
" (looking at the bill) Uhh, we still need a tip.",,,,,,Rachel
 A couple of bucks.,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey Joey!,,,,,,Rachel
 (disgusted at Ross's antics) Ugh!,,,,,,Rachel
 What?! You say that to kids?!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.",,,,,,Rachel
" Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! (She puts on her coat and turns around and sees Ross is expecting her to help.) (Laughing.) Are you kiddin'?,,,,,,Rachel
" (Disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. Much to her amazement, she is successful.) Oh. Oh! I can do it!",,,,,,Rachel
 Ross!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ross!,,,,,,Rachel
" Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.",,,,,,Rachel
 (To Ross) Fine! (To the salesman) We went out.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh-oh!,,,,,,Rachel
 Any chance you think the couch looks good there?,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?",,,,,,Rachel
 (noticing him) What's up Joey?,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?",,,,,,Rachel
 Thanks!,,,,,,Rachel
 I know.,,,,,,Rachel
 What's up Joe?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
 (laughing) What are you saying?,,,,,,Rachel
" Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.",,,,,,Rachel
" (laughs and pushes the chair back in) Yeah, well, y'know umm… No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I brought the next best thing.",,,,,,Rachel
" Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? (Points.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?! Why?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Good, you guys are all here!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!",,,,,,Rachel
 I know!,,,,,,Rachel
 Wh-what?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 O-okay!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!",,,,,,Rachel
 No!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, ""Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!"" (She starts laughing; Chandler and Joey are not amused.) Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!",,,,,,Rachel
" (We see a flashback as Rachel describes what happened.) All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me… Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh… (The flashback shows that she kissed him on the cheek.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I didn't know what else to do!",,,,,,Rachel
 Thanks Chandler.,,,,,,Rachel
 I can't believe it! I got a second interview!,,,,,,Rachel
" What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?",,,,,,Rachel
" I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause ""Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!""",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?,,,,,,Rachel
" Maybe. I-I don't know—Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Excuse me?,,,,,,Rachel
" (stopping him) Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I (He tries to interrupt and tell her about the ink), hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand s*x from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir. (She storms out of his office.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh. (Realizes.) Ohhhhhhhhh….,,,,,,Rachel
" Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.",,,,,,Rachel
" (looks around for the camera) Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, (She puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesn't know where to put her hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted s*x in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizes that she said courage twice.) Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  So she didn't want to sue him.   Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got (counts them off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (Pause) courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr…",,,,,,Rachel
" Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.",,,,,,Rachel
 (gasps) Oh! You are?,,,,,,Rachel
" Really? Oh thank you! Oh… Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, well then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand but misses and touches his groin.) Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that—I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so—Hey! I'll see you Monday! (Exits.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (laughs) I cannot believe Ross is buying this!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering from her room) Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay guys, way to wish me luck!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric (On the other one.) Sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
" (laughing nervously) Oh, what a fun office.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories…(stops and tries to change directions)…about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.",,,,,,Rachel
 …and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!,,,,,,Rachel
" I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!",,,,,,Rachel
" I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I can do that.",,,,,,Rachel
 I would love to!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh great!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh that's okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? (He holds up his pack.) Y'know what, actually… (She takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kim are standing and laughing.) Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, ""Wow, those guys are crazy!"" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, me too.",,,,,,Rachel
" (Laughs) Oh, me too.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thanks!,,,,,,Rachel
 Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.,,,,,,Rachel
 I did not!,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!",,,,,,Rachel
" No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.",,,,,,Rachel
 I am so on board! (She throws away her recently lit cigarette.),,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? (Laughs) Good luck, Rach.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! (She grabs their cigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.),,,,,,Rachel
 Okay then! (She starts rummaging through the trash to find Kim's lighter.),,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. (Starts to walk away.),,,,,,Rachel
 (hearing that) Oh man!,,,,,,Rachel
 What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, okay, not so weird.",,,,,,Rachel
" I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!",,,,,,Rachel
 No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.,,,,,,Rachel
 What's going on?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hm-mmm.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.",,,,,,Rachel
 Big night!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back. (Goes to her room.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (She enters and hands Phoebe the earring) Here you go. Thank you!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh what, you-you want both of them?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Tell her to wear her own earrings.,,,,,,Rachel
 Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!,,,,,,Rachel
 Because I lose her stuff!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!",,,,,,Rachel
" Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.",,,,,,Rachel
" But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay that is the one we already have!,,,,,,Rachel
 (smiling) What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 (smiling) Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" (smiling) Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.",,,,,,Rachel
" It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay! (Goes to the door.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) (To Phoebe) (whispering) Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer. (Puts 'em on.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, calm down, here they are. (Gives back the sunglasses.)",,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know, I don't know.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh that'd be great!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. (Holds out her arms for a hug.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Your sunglasses?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to… (Ross interrupts and shushes her.)",,,,,,Rachel
 I'm sorry.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. (She grabs a couple of the old pizza boxes and exits.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey! Hey! (Stops Caitlin) Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?",,,,,,Rachel
" No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number. (Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yay!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, thank God! Finally!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.",,,,,,Rachel
 Great! Thanks!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?",,,,,,Rachel
" No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! (She picks up the 2 pieces and looks at the stand.) Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?! (Looks for a place to hide it and finds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone rings.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! What's up?!,,,,,,Rachel
 So all we have is ice?,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh. Oh! (Takes a slug of tequila.),,,,,,Rachel
 (does Monica's) I know!,,,,,,Rachel
 What?! We can't do that!,,,,,,Rachel
 Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!,,,,,,Rachel
 I don't think he's the one who needs help.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ugh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen! (She hits a button on the machine.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Noooooooo!,,,,,,Rachel
" No, wait. Wait.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah well unless we tell him.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.",,,,,,Rachel
 Right?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?",,,,,,Rachel
 What?! What? What happened?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 (gasps) Really?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Because a car backfired?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole ""seizing"" thing but um, Emily called you today.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, she left a message. (He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) But it-it kinda got erased. There's just (Pause) something wrong with your machine.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.",,,,,,Rachel
" Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me—not important. The point is, I was right. You're decision. Okay? I was right. (She starts for the door.) (Stops) You're decision.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.",,,,,,Rachel
" I mean, look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, there you go!",,,,,,Rachel
 (laughing) Close call day.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. (Gets up.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh?,,,,,,Rachel
 No. (She heads for the door again.),,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" (going out the door) Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Hey, you guys…",,,,,,Rachel
 Is Monica here?,,,,,,Rachel
" All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.",,,,,,Rachel
" Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay! (She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, Ross stares in shock.) Check it out!",,,,,,Rachel
" It's a, it's a cat!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes it is!,,,,,,Rachel
" Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.",,,,,,Rachel
 A thousand bucks.,,,,,,Rachel
" All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They both glare at her.) Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, it's my cat.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, I got a cat.",,,,,,Rachel
" You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, ""Rachel!""",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I was gonna let you play with it.",,,,,,Rachel
" (she's wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!",,,,,,Rachel
 I tried! They won't take her back.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?",,,,,,Rachel
" No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! (A woman approaches.),,,,,,Rachel
 It's not a baby! It's a cat!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no! No! It's actually—it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! (Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) Yeah, do you want it?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, a thousand.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.",,,,,,Rachel
" (makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled) Damnit! (To the cat) Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! (The cat hisses at her again, it sounds like Rachel) Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?",,,,,,Rachel
" It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. (Pause) Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, there you go. (Hands over the pillow.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind. (Turns and walks away.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, are you okay?",,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, my eye is a little itchy.",,,,,,Rachel
 Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!",,,,,,Rachel
" (flinches) Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?",,,,,,Rachel
 (flinches again) Monica! Come on!,,,,,,Rachel
 (freaks) Ross! Stop it! Come on!,,,,,,Rachel
 Chandler!,,,,,,Rachel
 Just stop it! Come on!,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering from her bedroom) All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! (She walks by the table and notices that no one is looking and accidentally on purpose knocks over the open cereal box.) Ohhh! No! Look what I did! (She starts walking through the mess. {Also, notice the continuity error in this scene. Note the position of the box and dispersal pattern of the cereal before and after the camera cut.}) Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! What does that thing do?,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, I'm outta here!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 So were done then!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 (jerks back from the tester) What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 All right.,,,,,,Rachel
" I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. (Puts her head back.) Okay.",,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. Okay!,,,,,,Rachel
" (really excited) Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! (He took out that thing they use to look at people's retinas and looked at Rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to flinch and scream at him.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.",,,,,,Rachel
 Great!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, just give me the damn drops! (Grabs them and storms out.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.",,,,,,Rachel
 Damn!,,,,,,Rachel
 Bye you guys!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! (Runs after him.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.",,,,,,Rachel
 Eh! Stop it!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. (She tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. The only problem is, it's not over her eye.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!",,,,,,Rachel
 All right!,,,,,,Rachel
 All right.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, they are. (No they're not.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (thinks) Four.,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay!,,,,,,Rachel
 Great!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, well, you said it was practice!",,,,,,Rachel
 Because I knew you were lying!,,,,,,Rachel
 (as she's being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.),,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!,,,,,,Rachel
 Monica! Stop it!,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risqué pose, at least for primetime TV.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Yep!,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! (She's trying to recover while still on the floor.),,,,,,Rachel
 Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?,,,,,,Rachel
 No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.,,,,,,Rachel
 (under her breath) Sucker!,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering with Ross) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.",,,,,,Rachel
 That sounds great.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.",,,,,,Rachel
 No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.,,,,,,Rachel
" No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",,,,,,Rachel
" (takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} (In her head.) Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen…naked! I'm picking up an orange. (Does so) I'm naked! (Goes into the living room) Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully. (She backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body away.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (singing) Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! (There's a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes to answer the door.) Love to love ya, baby! (There's another knock.) Darnit! (Looks through the peephole and turns on the lights.) Ugh. (She opens the door to Ross who's leaning against the door jam.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, yeah, if you want too.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, sure?",,,,,,Rachel
" And um, what-what is that Ross?",,,,,,Rachel
 (laughs) What?! Are you crazy?,,,,,,Rachel
" (gasps) Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!",,,,,,Rachel
" Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have s*x with you?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh wow! I’m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of ""us?""",,,,,,Rachel
" (taking off her sweater) Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.",,,,,,Rachel
 I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross! What are you… I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.",,,,,,Rachel
" (to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only seconds after Rachel pushed the call button was she there. Once again, more proof that TV isn't real, IRL she would've been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then Ross's pants would be dry.) Hi!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent. (Disembarks)",,,,,,Rachel
 Ahh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hello! (She makes a face and the kid laughs harder. Finally, his parents drag him off.) Ohh, kids love me.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi! (Hugs Phoebe),,,,,,Rachel
 Pancho Vila?,,,,,,Rachel
" What are you talking about Pheebs? (Takes out her compact) I don't… (She gasps when she looks in the mirror and sees her face.) (To Ross) Oh my God, you drew on me?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can—you have so crossed a line. (Heads for the bathroom)",,,,,,Rachel
" (returning with her purse covering her face) All right, it won't come off!",,,,,,Rachel
 It won't come off!,,,,,,Rachel
" No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi. (She hugs Joey.),,,,,,Rachel
 What?! What else did he say?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, I am a human doodle!!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, I need a, I need a drink! (Makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (she's finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.) Macadamia nut?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hm-mmm! (Opens the container),,,,,,Rachel
" Nope! (She puts one in her mouth and spits it out, then does it again in another direction.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hit me!,,,,,,Rachel
 I bet 20.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (She slows down with each one.),,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. (Gets up but stumbles a little bit.) Whup, okay. (She makes it to the phone and picks it up, without dialing.) Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck! (Goes and hugs Joey.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohhh!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.",,,,,,Rachel
 Good luck to ya!,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow!,,,,,,Rachel
 (bowing) Hello!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! (Throws some more rice.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Wait! (Gets her bearings) Okay!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! (Throws some more rice.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Wait! (Gets her bearings) Okay!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohhh! (Looks in the mirror and sees that she still has her mustache and groans.),,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.",,,,,,Rachel
" (To Ross) I don’t know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.",,,,,,Rachel
 (gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.),,,,,,Rachel
" No, we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God.,,,,,,Rachel
 No!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, hubby!",,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay! So, we’ll just stay married.",,,,,,Rachel
 And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding.",,,,,,Rachel
 What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me.",,,,,,Rachel
 You are asking me to be your wife!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" (thinks about it for a second) No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh b-b-but it is!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!",,,,,,Rachel
" Thank you. (He goes to leave.) Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?",,,,,,Rachel
" Huh, that’s funny. You look like you’re gonna be the…",,,,,,Rachel
" All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. (Exits.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?",,,,,,Rachel
 Pheebs?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh? Yeah! Sure!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh but Phoebe, we’re gonna be late for the movie.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, we’re, we’re actually just gonna walk ‘cause it’s right up there at the Angelica.",,,,,,Rachel
" (to the driver) Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!",,,,,,Rachel
 What was that?!,,,,,,Rachel
 I haven’t seen it yet!,,,,,,Rachel
 Noooooooo!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.",,,,,,Rachel
" I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys!,,,,,,Rachel
" And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!",,,,,,Rachel
" And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God… (Gasps and starts to sing) Come and knock on my door…,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hey roomie!,,,,,,Rachel
 (gasps) Are you pregnant?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Um-hmm.,,,,,,Rachel
" (laughs) Oh my God! Oh, that’s funny, I can’t believe I did that.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. (Sits back and resumes her reading.),,,,,,Rachel
 Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks.,,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, where did you get these?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, good God, they’re so yummy! (She re-ingests the previously expelled cookie matter from the tissue.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 (grabbing the star) What the hell is that?,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!",,,,,,Rachel
" Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know, I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time.",,,,,,Rachel
 Are you okay? You’re not blinking.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era.",,,,,,Rachel
 What is the matter with you?!,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
 But I…,,,,,,Rachel
 It is? Really?,,,,,,Rachel
" (starting to lose her composure) I mean we’re not, we’re not gonna live together anymore?",,,,,,Rachel
 What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much! (Starts to cry.),,,,,,Rachel
 I mean it’s the end of an era!,,,,,,Rachel
 Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering from her room) Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well since I’m movin’ out and-and you’re so beautiful…,,,,,,Rachel
 …how about I move in with you?,,,,,,Rachel
 You have a roommate?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that’s true.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place.",,,,,,Rachel
" Pheebs, I have to ask you…",,,,,,Rachel
 You’re just staring into space.,,,,,,Rachel
 This one? (Picks it up.),,,,,,Rachel
" Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; (Points to one and starts to read it.) ""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" It’s just, there is nothing! The city’s full!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! Why?,,,,,,Rachel
 That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love Warren! Thank you!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh, thank you!",,,,,,Rachel
" (returning from calling Warren) Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! Are you serious?!,,,,,,Rachel
 I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank you!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisses him on the cheek and exits.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.",,,,,,Rachel
" No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here!",,,,,,Rachel
" No-no, I’m staying put.",,,,,,Rachel
" Why, where are you going?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh wow.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. Y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’s gonna be weird?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, because of us! Because of our history.",,,,,,Rachel
 No?,,,,,,Rachel
 No! Not at all!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend, you’re gonna have a girlfriend…",,,,,,Rachel
" But y’know what, if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll just work out a system. Y’know, it’ll be like college, I’ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, ""Come back later, I’m gettin’ lucky."" (Laughs.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, well let’s see Monica and Chandler are occupied.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, the other thing. I really think it’s great they work things out.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?",,,,,,Rachel
" Thank you. (Gets up) Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there’s no turning back.",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.",,,,,,Rachel
" So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?",,,,,,Rachel
 And?,,,,,,Rachel
 Look at that!,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" No-no, I bought those.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. (Rachel walks away.),,,,,,Rachel
" Well, who wouldn’t?!",,,,,,Rachel
 And Mrs.?!,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! Oh God! (Laughs her way into the living room.),,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?",,,,,,Rachel
" Some uh, some visual aides.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey Pheebs, you’re still alive! How are you doing?",,,,,,Rachel
" Pheebs, what-what are you doing?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?",,,,,,Rachel
 Monica!,,,,,,Rachel
 Did-did you take these back?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, they’re really great! Aren’t they?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.),,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15 minutes.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. (to them) Hey sisters! (They ignore her.) (To Monica) Wow, we really are bitches.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, and not a very good one.",,,,,,Rachel
" (in an Indian accent) Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.",,,,,,Rachel
 No! They are mine!,,,,,,Rachel
 You stole them from me!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well…,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!",,,,,,Rachel
 Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.,,,,,,Rachel
 Really? Really?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay! (Picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (In an Irish accent) ""Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we’d like you to come on board with us full time! (Hangs up.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?! How do you know?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I’m sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
 (answering it) Hello?,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh no, he’s not. Can I take a message?",,,,,,Rachel
 Ross got married again—Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!",,,,,,Rachel
 I cannot believe that you didn’t tell me that we are still married!!,,,,,,Rachel
 When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! (To All) Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.,,,,,,Rachel
" So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross’s, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well there’s an idea!!,,,,,,Rachel
" That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?",,,,,,Rachel
" December 26th, huh maybe she’s Santa Clause.",,,,,,Rachel
" (deadpan) Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well sure, if you say you’re gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! (Grabs them from him.) All right, now I’m gonna do this my way and I don’t want to hear a peep out of you!",,,,,,Rachel
 Op! You’re peeping!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross! Y’know what, I just got—why? Why did you do this?!",,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t wanna hear ""Three failed marriages!""",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, y’know what? Thanks to you I’m half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don’t think I have ever been this angry!",,,,,,Rachel
 Ugh! (Stares at him.),,,,,,Rachel
" Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh yes, heroin and crack.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you would know.",,,,,,Rachel
" (starts to cry) Ross, please, I found the magazines!",,,,,,Rachel
 Ugh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! (To the stenographer) And could you strike ""Consummated like bunnies"" from the record?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.",,,,,,Rachel
 (stands up as well) What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!,,,,,,Rachel
" (to the judge) Okay, do you see, do you see what you’re keeping me married too?!",,,,,,Rachel
" All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!",,,,,,Rachel
 And thank you for your time. (They both beat a hasty retreat.),,,,,,Rachel
 This is totally your fault!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!",,,,,,Rachel
 Don’t call us that! (Storms away),,,,,,Rachel
" (deadpan) Oh honey thank God you’re home, I was getting worried.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!,,,,,,Rachel
 Nothing. (Sits down.),,,,,,Rachel
" Uh-hmm. (Just as Rachel finishes signing her name, Ross yanks each page out of the way.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay Ross, we’re—wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?",,,,,,Rachel
" And uh, yeah, I didn’t really, I didn’t want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then (Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, don’t push it though.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret, and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. (They both laugh.)",,,,,,Rachel
" No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m gonna need a copy of those.,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering from her room) Pheebs, I was wondering…",,,,,,Rachel
 Well and clearly not a minute sooner.,,,,,,Rachel
 Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, yeah, I know.",,,,,,Rachel
 Surprise!!,,,,,,Rachel
" No, no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, ""What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!"" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohhhhhh, look it’s the roller blades.",,,,,,Rachel
 You remember when we got these?,,,,,,Rachel
 I guess you weren’t there. (They hug.),,,,,,Rachel
" I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.",,,,,,Rachel
 I have one.,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen. (Laughs. Monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)",,,,,,Rachel
 You get your messages!,,,,,,Rachel
" So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, your brother. Score!",,,,,,Rachel
" You know what else I’m not gonna miss? ""I’m Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!""",,,,,,Rachel
" ""I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!""",,,,,,Rachel
" ""Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend! So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!""",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m unpacking!,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m not moving! (She re-hangs a picture, crookedly.) Is that picture straight?",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, y’know what? You’re the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Well it’s mine too! What else you got?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks over Monica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Great! Monica’s moving!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica starts chasing Rachel around the table.),,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I’m just mad!",,,,,,Rachel
" Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh really? Like what Monica?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, good start Mon.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it’s gonna be fine.",,,,,,Rachel
" But honey, I think she’s moving in with Chandler.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.),,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God! This is silly, I’m gonna see you in a couple of hours! (They hug again.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Bye house!,,,,,,Rachel
 Bye Mon.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi...,,,,,,Rachel
 Rachel...,,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe’s...,,,,,,Rachel
 leave...,,,,,,Rachel
" Wait, I-I just said ""leave.""",,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, come on that's silly.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Everybody…,,,,,,Rachel
 Rachel…,,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe’s…,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y’know roommate bonding thing.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah and there's really cute guys there.,,,,,,Rachel
 OK!,,,,,,Rachel
 Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. (Runs off.),,,,,,Rachel
" You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! I used to do that too!,,,,,,Rachel
" Aw, Mon...(Kisses her on the cheek)",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.",,,,,,Rachel
" You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.",,,,,,Rachel
" Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!",,,,,,Rachel
 Ankle.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!",,,,,,Rachel
" No, wait Phoebe.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, um, I...(Phoebe walks into her room.) All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I-I should've told you the truth.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...(Starts flapping her arms)",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.",,,,,,Rachel
 Because they're people.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, but still. They're people…with eyes.",,,,,,Rachel
" I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.",,,,,,Rachel
 (Runs into Phoebe.) Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!",,,,,,Rachel
 Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. (Turns and bumps into a mounted policeman and falls) Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry! (Runs off.),,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, sure, but they might think it’s kinda weird considering I don’t work there anymore.",,,,,,Rachel
" I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. (chuckling) A year ago..,,,,,,Rachel
" But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much.",,,,,,Rachel
 Sure.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God. Did you talk to him?,,,,,,Rachel
 What? What!?! You kissed him?,,,,,,Rachel
 (Gasps) Phoebe are you serious?,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, I mean, you do know he’s married?",,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe…,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Kim, Hi. (Kim doesn’t even look up from her report.)",,,,,,Rachel
" So you know, I…I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ahh….So…Wow…The spring line, it’s really going to be great this year, huh?",,,,,,Rachel
 So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room. (Kim stops the elevator and turns to Rachel.),,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. (Sitting down on the couch.) You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just…made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.",,,,,,Rachel
" That-that is your make out buddy. Don’t you recognize him? (Holding up the magazine in front of her face.) Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh My God, Phoebe, that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy guy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!",,,,,,Rachel
 To get you to make out with him!!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, hi, Kim.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true.",,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.",,,,,,Rachel
 I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard. (The elevator stops. Ralph steps on.),,,,,,Rachel
" Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.",,,,,,Rachel
 I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.,,,,,,Rachel
" You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?",,,,,,Rachel
" I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn’t.",,,,,,Rachel
 That wouldn’t help me.,,,,,,Rachel
" Kim, hi.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.,,,,,,Rachel
" (Faking crying.) Yeah, he dumped me. He said, ""Rachel, I can’t do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry."" And then I don’t know why but he said, ""and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine.""",,,,,,Rachel
 Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.,,,,,,Rachel
 You and Ralph?,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English trifle!",,,,,,Rachel
 (worried) Nothing?,,,,,,Rachel
" So, if-if I mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert?",,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?",,,,,,Rachel
 Her dancer friends?,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?!,,,,,,Rachel
" I dunno. Y’know to me he’ll always be “Jack Geller, walks in while you’re changing.”",,,,,,Rachel
" (looking at her trifle) Look at it, isn’t it beautiful?",,,,,,Rachel
" It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!",,,,,,Rachel
" The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y’know, I thought “well, there’s mincemeat pie,” I mean that’s an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. [To Joey] Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?",,,,,,Rachel
 (teasingly) And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste.,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!",,,,,,Rachel
 No!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
" (sarcastically) No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s so romantic.",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like “Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”",,,,,,Rachel
" So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay...,,,,,,Rachel
" What’s up, Ross?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no. No Ross, don’t do this.",,,,,,Rachel
 I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.,,,,,,Rachel
" I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you’re [pity-tone] alone, alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, you’re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don’t get any dessert.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it’s trifle time!",,,,,,Rachel
 It sure is.,,,,,,Rachel
 Beef.,,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!",,,,,,Rachel
" Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well?,,,,,,Rachel
 Really? How good?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.",,,,,,Rachel
" ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?",,,,,,Rachel
" (humoring Phoebe) Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!",,,,,,Rachel
" (reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...) I wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle!",,,,,,Rachel
" You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!",,,,,,Rachel
" That’s a good story, Grandpa.",,,,,,Rachel
" So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I used to date him, but you’re still going out with her!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry, but I don’t think that was a romantic thing.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.",,,,,,Rachel
 We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.,,,,,,Rachel
" Don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search, OK?",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?",,,,,,Rachel
 That’s right!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it’s a Macy’s bag!",,,,,,Rachel
" (Reading) Dear losers, do you really think I’d hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they’d break you.",,,,,,Rachel
 We are so gonna find them this year.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?",,,,,,Rachel
 Ha!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, this is hollow.",,,,,,Rachel
" This bench, it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that! (She pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) Oh, the presents!!!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, this one’s for me!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, let’s open them!",,,,,,Rachel
" Whatever Linus, I’m opening mine.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?",,,,,,Rachel
 ‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. Don’t do this to yourself.,,,,,,Rachel
 I know.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! (Grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds the rest back out to Chandler.) You can throw the rest away.",,,,,,Rachel
 Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows her the picture.),,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! It’s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?,,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay fine! I’ll-I’ll just tell her it’s an antique apothecary table, she doesn’t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Guess!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ha! See, I knew, I knew you’d get it on the first guess. Isn’t it cool! It’s an apothecary table.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, yes.",,,,,,Rachel
 Almost.,,,,,,Rachel
 It was only 500 bucks.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y’know like back then.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y’know, it was like a dollar.",,,,,,Rachel
 And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, it’s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y’know?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! We’re here!,,,,,,Rachel
 (seeing his new table) Ohh! Oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh no!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross! Phoebe’s gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!",,,,,,Rachel
 I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she’s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.,,,,,,Rachel
 Because she hates Pottery Barn.,,,,,,Rachel
" I know! I know, she says it’s all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (Ross looks at his table.) So come on, she’s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, get over it! It’s not like she hates you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, she’s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, Phoebe’s here! Okay, let’s turn out all the lights and we’ll just watch the movie!",,,,,,Rachel
 He got it a flea market!,,,,,,Rachel
 That’s funny. (Phoebe puts her feet up on Ross’s table.),,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same apothecary table they have.),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yes.,,,,,,Rachel
" …see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I know. I went a little crazy.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well there’s yore. And uh, y’know, yesteryear.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh honey he doesn’t need my help.,,,,,,Rachel
" (not sure of what to do) Y’know what? I don’t, I don’t think Phoebe really wants to come.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, she does want to.",,,,,,Rachel
" Pheebs, I don’t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, y’know what? Don’t look at it. (Realizes the display is their living room) Seriously, don’t look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh, those bastards! Let’s go.",,,,,,Rachel
" No! No! No! No it’s not! No it’s not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don’t have the… (Looks desperately for something different.) We don’t have the…that lamp! And-and that screen is y’know, on the other side.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay! Okay-okay look—no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just… Come on don’t be mad.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?! No! I’m not gonna move out!,,,,,,Rachel
 (gets it) Oh. Yes! I would so move out!,,,,,,Rachel
 That’s right!,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)",,,,,,Rachel
 We are looking at a Playboy.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’",,,,,,Rachel
" You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in handy",,,,,,Rachel
 (thinks) I don’t know.,,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, what are you doing?",,,,,,Rachel
" (To Monica) Well, people are different.",,,,,,Rachel
" What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover? I’m not a pushover.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go to lunch. (She leaves)",,,,,,Rachel
 I cannot believe her.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.",,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.",,,,,,Rachel
" Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a long way. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.",,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.",,,,,,Rachel
" So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.",,,,,,Rachel
 I am not a pushover!,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever heard.",,,,,,Rachel
 How-how did you lose your job here?,,,,,,Rachel
" He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s not right.",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’m not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No, I really shouldn’t say anything—No, I should say something to him. (Goes to the counter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him…",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I’m sorry. (Gets up and moves.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?",,,,,,Rachel
" Wait a minute, you’re only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, no one thinks you’re a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue. (She notices something hanging from Monica’s nose, as does Joey.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, Jill!",,,,,,Rachel
 This is Chandler. (Points at him.),,,,,,Rachel
 And you know Monica and Ross!,,,,,,Rachel
" And that’s Phoebe (points), and that’s Joey.",,,,,,Rachel
" Don’t!! (Joey backs away frightened.) (To Jill) Honey, what are you doing here?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! What did he say?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proud of me.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?",,,,,,Rachel
" Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could’ve ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get a job, you’re gonna get an apartment, and then I’ll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hey! What’s goin’ on?,,,,,,Rachel
 (notices Jill’s bags) Jill! Did you shop?!,,,,,,Rachel
" You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!",,,,,,Rachel
 What’d you get?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
 Apartment pants?,,,,,,Rachel
" No, of course, of course I’ve heard of them! Ross, what did you get?",,,,,,Rachel
 A pajmena?,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
 Jill?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, come on! You think that’s gonna work on me?! I invented that!",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, it’s okay. One little setback is okay, just don’t let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I’m just gonna take the-the pajmena. (Ross hands it to her.) And the uh, and the uh pants. Y’know what, I’m just gonna take it all away, ‘cause that way you’ll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I’m gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. (Leaves with all of Jill’s stuff.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 What’s up?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 With Ross and Jill?,,,,,,Rachel
 With Ross and my sister?,,,,,,Rachel
 With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh there is no way.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they’re gonna have s*x! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—I don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.",,,,,,Rachel
" (on the couch) Oh hi! Y’know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.",,,,,,Rachel
" That is great. Hey, y’know who doesn’t have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you’re gonna go out?",,,,,,Rachel
" I just, Phoebe, said y’know thought she saw something between you guys.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?",,,,,,Rachel
 Are-are you saying he’s a geek?,,,,,,Rachel
" No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!",,,,,,Rachel
 What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that’s not what I meant.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah but, he’s not your type.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah but, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t want to try to much too fast. Y’know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don’t you?",,,,,,Rachel
 She-she died Jill.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 Well yeah…,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh so-so not really never.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I-I don’t like it.",,,,,,Rachel
 It’s kinda slutty.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah well, I’m-I’m a slut.",,,,,,Rachel
 Rachel.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it’s not!",,,,,,Rachel
 Why aren’t you home yet?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yes, it’s me! Sorry!",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, I’m just, I’m just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?",,,,,,Rachel
" (gasps) Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh, she is a slut!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, this is just terrible.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh. (Squeaks again.),,,,,,Rachel
 Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. And y’know who should’ve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh don’t even ask!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!",,,,,,Rachel
 (to Gunther) I’ll take a coffee. (To Ross) So how was your big date last night?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?",,,,,,Rachel
" So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, slides. (Laughs.) So really nothing happened.",,,,,,Rachel
" Right. Was it the, ""Please don’t show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?""",,,,,,Rachel
 She asked-asked you out again?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can’t! I can’t! I can’t! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can’t. It’s just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can’t do it! I can’t do it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you. I…yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can’t! I can’t do it! (Starts to freak out.) It’s just gonna freak me out!!!",,,,,,Rachel
 Ross thanks.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that’s-that’s crazy—I mean that’s crazy. So what’s-what’s going on with you? What is going on with you?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah do it now, call right now.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.,,,,,,Rachel
" It’s not random, it’s Bob.",,,,,,Rachel
" No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hm-mmm.,,,,,,Rachel
 Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history…,,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
 (changing the subject) Y’know Bob in Human Resources…,,,,,,Rachel
" Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross! There’s a million other guys out there, you just…",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!,,,,,,Rachel
 Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can’t have!,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!",,,,,,Rachel
 In Human Resources!!!!!!,,,,,,Rachel
 …I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Do I have my own castle?,,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.",,,,,,Rachel
 Absolutely not.,,,,,,Rachel
 Probably just the first half.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well it’s hard to tell… (Rachel gets up to get a closer look, only she’s having some trouble.) Oh God, if she would just stop moving.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it’s a tattoo! That’s weird, Phoebe doesn’t… Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, is Ross home? Maybe I’ll just call him to see if he’s actually seen her.",,,,,,Rachel
 (on phone) What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! I knew it! What happened?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?! You kissed!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, it doesn’t sound like it! I mean, it’s pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Let me give you something to think about! (She pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow. I, I don’t even know what to say. Thank you. (Gently kicks him.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I got that.",,,,,,Rachel
 Bye-bye-e!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!",,,,,,Rachel
 Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad? (Giggles.) God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?",,,,,,Rachel
 Merrill Lynch?,,,,,,Rachel
 Well why didn’t you take the job?,,,,,,Rachel
 (gasps) Rob Tillman!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I’m sorry. Ross Tillman.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, of course Monica’s brother!",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! How are you?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! Me too!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it’s the best! (They both exhale contemplating the joys of marriage.) So, umm how’s Monica?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, I would love too.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! Okay!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh wait, don’t you have to pay for your, (looks at his magazine) Busty Ladies?",,,,,,Rachel
 (laughs) Oh yeah? Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 But! Don’t you have to give him his money back?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight? (She’s not quite sure of that one.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah. Right. So now, are—do you, do you still do music?",,,,,,Rachel
" (interrupting him and seeing Joey) Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!",,,,,,Rachel
 (stunned) You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?,,,,,,Rachel
 He’s coming over! He’s coming over!,,,,,,Rachel
 (giggles and can’t look at him) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" (still not quite able to look at him) Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you…",,,,,,Rachel
 Ah!,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" (laughs) Wow! Umm, y’know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn’t.",,,,,,Rachel
" (awestruck, then not) Isn’t that a line from the show?!",,,,,,Rachel
 That’s a line from the show too!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.",,,,,,Rachel
" (mouthing it to him) Yes, you did.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh! And I’m one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it’s so easy for you I mean, you’re not married, you get to have s*x with who ever you want!",,,,,,Rachel
" Monica. You’ve, you’ve done it right?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! You’re a 30 year old virgin!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you’ve waited long enough!!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes!! I mean s*x does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions! Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever…",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh what do you know? Virgin!,,,,,,Rachel
 (very relived) Oh! Thank God!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay! (She picks up the phone, Joey’s phone number, and starts to dial.) Here we go! Okay! (On phone.) Hi, Joey! It’s Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, I mean it’s just so realistic!",,,,,,Rachel
 Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! (Laughs and finishes her drink.),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I probably shouldn’t—so I will! (Joey starts making her refill and Rachel notices that rain thing Joey has.) Oh! Wow! It’s like it’s raining!",,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, can I use your bathroom?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. (Starts to go.) God y’know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani’s apartment…",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, it sure is!",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, you’re such an amazing actor! (He smiles.) How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! Tell me something Joey—(She falls off the couch)—Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. (She climbs back onto the couch.),,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow! I can’t, I can’t feel my hands.",,,,,,Rachel
 (wakes up suddenly and realizes where she is) Oh right.,,,,,,Rachel
 (groans) Oh God. Oh I can’t believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!,,,,,,Rachel
" Noo! Oh God we did—we didn’t, we didn’t uhh…",,,,,,Rachel
 God I’m just a horrible person.,,,,,,Rachel
" Because I’m married. That’s right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star’s apartment to have an affair! Uck!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah and I’m a horrible, horrible person.",,,,,,Rachel
" The ring from the cave, yeah.",,,,,,Rachel
" (seeing the ring and gasping) Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!",,,,,,Rachel
 No! No-no-no…,,,,,,Rachel
 But I thought that ring stood for Caprice’s undying love for her brother.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! My God! Barry!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh that’s right! I’m sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi Ross!,,,,,,Rachel
 Is Joey Tribbiani here?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I’m looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!",,,,,,Rachel
" Me? I’m great! I’m fine! I’m sooo good!! But, you know who’s not great?! Men! You’re a man right Ross?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Sit down!,,,,,,Rachel
" Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we’re going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor’s dog walker?!",,,,,,Rachel
 No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?,,,,,,Rachel
 Aw what are you?! A detective?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh. (Doesn’t believe it.),,,,,,Rachel
 Who are these men?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is (whispers) gay.",,,,,,Rachel
 Good day for married people huh?,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there (points) and pretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Isn’t that a kind of sushi?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!,,,,,,Rachel
" (To Phoebe) Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, Valentine’s Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn’t get her a calendar!",,,,,,Rachel
" Aw, I love that.",,,,,,Rachel
" (interrupting him) Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!",,,,,,Rachel
 What the hell was that?!,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, so we weren’t prepared!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. (She does the finger thing.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Yep!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, of course!",,,,,,Rachel
" Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who’s ass I cannot kick.",,,,,,Rachel
 Say it!,,,,,,Rachel
 Say it!,,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t like sitting up here! I’m just gonna over… (She starts to get up.),,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!,,,,,,Rachel
" I… Well, I don’t think they need any help.",,,,,,Rachel
 Who wrote it?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering from the bathroom) Hey Mon? I’m gonna check my messages.,,,,,,Rachel
" (on phone) Hello? (Shocked that someone answered.) Uh, Rachel. (To the gang.) Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!",,,,,,Rachel
" (on phone) Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! (Hangs up) That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, he didn’t say, but it was a fire. I’m guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!",,,,,,Rachel
 My God! (They both run into the bedrooms.),,,,,,Rachel
 Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater. (Hold it up.),,,,,,Rachel
 Fine! I’m sorry for your loss! (Hands it back to her.),,,,,,Rachel
" (stands up) Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay Phoebe calm down, there’s no need to place blame. Okay? (To the fireman) I warned her about those candles.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay! (She jumps on the bed.),,,,,,Rachel
 I have.,,,,,,Rachel
 I did.,,,,,,Rachel
" I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, don’t look at me! My hair’s straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Joey! Sorry!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
 I’ve never lived like this before.,,,,,,Rachel
 I love it at Joey’s!,,,,,,Rachel
 Thanks!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what? I’m fine here.",,,,,,Rachel
" No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don’t want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!",,,,,,Rachel
 I know. I’m sorry.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi Joey, how ya doin’?",,,,,,Rachel
" Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m not paying for half of that! I’m only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.,,,,,,Rachel
 That refrigerators don’t live as long as people.,,,,,,Rachel
 You’re jokin’ right?,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank God you’re pretty. (Exits.),,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Do you guys know any cute guys?,,,,,,Rachel
" Anyway, there’s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go…",,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t know, something either trees or disease—Ralph mumbles a lot.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! It’s weird. But the thing is need to find a date.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oo! When’s her birthday?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, y’know it’s just been so long since I’ve been to Chuckie Cheese.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.",,,,,,Rachel
" We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. (Chandler’s shocked.) What? I read that.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yes! Thank you! (He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.),,,,,,Rachel
 (shocked) What?,,,,,,Rachel
 You found me a guy?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, y’know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I’m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, thank you.",,,,,,Rachel
 What are you guys doing?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, but y’know, no, you didn’t give me your phone number.",,,,,,Rachel
 I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!,,,,,,Rachel
 All right.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, I’ll meet ‘em.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh…,,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t know. I know I don’t work late tomorrow night.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Well-well a little blind sided but y’know good.,,,,,,Rachel
 I—Ohh! (Moves over and lets Eldad sit on the couch.),,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hi.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh-okay, but Pheebs?",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m just sort of in the middle of something.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, y’know what? Maybe I should go!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I’m good.",,,,,,Rachel
 No-no! Don’t dance for me! Please? Don’t! (She gets up to yell at her ‘friends.’) What is the matter with you guys?,,,,,,Rachel
 I… Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?,,,,,,Rachel
" I’ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It’s you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!",,,,,,Rachel
" I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean (To Patrick) congratulations on all the cash, (He nods) and-and y’know—(Feels Eldad’s hair)—Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! (Grabs her stuff, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly, and to Eldad) Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you! (Storms out.),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh that’s all right! Y’know, I ended up having a really good time. Y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.",,,,,,Rachel
 I wanna say a disease.,,,,,,Rachel
 Huh. All right.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh-oh Professor Geller.,,,,,,Rachel
 So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.,,,,,,Rachel
" Huh—Wait so Joey if you get this, you’re gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you’ll be like the Big Cheese! (To Phoebe) Or the Big Mac—Hey! You love those!",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, what are you talking about? You’re a terrific actor.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!",,,,,,Rachel
"  I'm sorry, what?",,,,,,Rachel
"  (on the phone) Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! (Pause) I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. (Hangs up.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!,,,,,,Rachel
 Already? That’s pretty bad what you did.,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!!,,,,,,Rachel
 (mocking him) You fell asleep?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!,,,,,,Rachel
" And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!",,,,,,Rachel
 That is the most ridiculous...,,,,,,Rachel
 I did not sell you out.,,,,,,Rachel
 Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead],,,,,,Rachel
" OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]",,,,,,Rachel
 Fine!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, Chandler!",,,,,,Rachel
" And your horoscope says, ""On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift.""",,,,,,Rachel
" Op, but the twelfth brings a lover’s spat.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.",,,,,,Rachel
 (ecstatic) Oh my God! It’s Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Be-because the last one was such a big seller?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 (To Phoebe) We do?,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, I’m sorry I’m late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz’s father get here?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! Ross is sooo great!,,,,,,Rachel
 (seeing him) Oh hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Well let’s look for them. (Finds some under one of the couch cushions. It has a pink, fuzzy ball on the key chain.) Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?",,,,,,Rachel
 All right! (Throws them back under the cushion.),,,,,,Rachel
 Oh good.,,,,,,Rachel
" (chasing after him) Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?",,,,,,Rachel
" Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.",,,,,,Rachel
 You just don’t look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh. We?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just—I meant y’know are you still a ‘We’ or are you just ‘You?’",,,,,,Rachel
 (sympathetic) Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh. (She touches his arm for support and likes what she feels) Ooh!,,,,,,Rachel
 I was just getting him to like you.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, Joey is not here.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, it’s okay. You can come out.",,,,,,Rachel
 Bye!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, y’know he lost his keys so he was looking for them…",,,,,,Rachel
" No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y’know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, what’s the big deal? So I kissed the guy!",,,,,,Rachel
 Wh—You dated my sister!,,,,,,Rachel
 What? Why?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let’s face it, so far the guy’s not lovin’ ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y’know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh it’s important!,,,,,,Rachel
" So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh we were, but that was just a (pause as the audience reacts), I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Whoops! I’m sorry, you were talking about Emily!",,,,,,Rachel
" I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.",,,,,,Rachel
" Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me. (Everyone looks at her, Ross not happily.) Maybe I have to pee again. (Gets up to try to use the bathroom.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (returning) Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! I’ve got a lot of those too!,,,,,,Rachel
 What’s the matter?,,,,,,Rachel
 So what-what is the exhibit.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.,,,,,,Rachel
 Umm.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, the gift shop!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, wait yes, but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?! No! Why?!,,,,,,Rachel
 I didn’t know you could get married here.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?,,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah hon, it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it.",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m gonna do it too!,,,,,,Rachel
" Really? Who would, who would you marry?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh Pheebs.,,,,,,Rachel
" (from another room) Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.",,,,,,Rachel
 It’s so secluded up here.,,,,,,Rachel
" I feel like we’re the only two people in the world. (She sets down her wine class, picks up a walnut, and knocks another one on the floor.) Oops. Sorry. (She reaches down to pick it up and Ross hands it to her. Ross is hiding under the couch and causes Rachel to scream.)",,,,,,Rachel
" No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I—would you—actually, would you go check on that?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. (After Paul leaves Rachel drops to the floor to confront Ross.) What?! What are you doing here?!,,,,,,Rachel
 I came with Paul!,,,,,,Rachel
 Get up!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ahh. Thank you!,,,,,,Rachel
" Op, ice. I need ice.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! (Ross gets up and heads for the kitchen.) No! Not in there! He’s in there! (She points Ross to the door next to the kitchen.),,,,,,Rachel
 Go-go!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, thank you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.",,,,,,Rachel
 Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, why do y’know go in that room (points to the room Ross is in) and do your homework?",,,,,,Rachel
" That’s your, that’s your dad’s bedroom. (Yelling) That’s your dad’s bedroom!",,,,,,Rachel
" Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!",,,,,,Rachel
" Really? Okay. Okay, I-I’ll go upstairs. (to Paul) If-if you get me something from the car.",,,,,,Rachel
 Surprise me.,,,,,,Rachel
" (yelling) So you’re gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that’s where everybody’s gonna be!",,,,,,Rachel
 (yelling from the living room) Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don’t go in there! Don’t go in there! I need another soda!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here?,,,,,,Rachel
" Good. Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy. Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",,,,,,Rachel
 So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 (To Phoebe) Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. (Gets up and starts to leave with Paul.),,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah that’s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah that’s great Paul, but y’know I wanna know what—(Puts her hands on his shoulders)—Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y’know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.",,,,,,Rachel
" No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! Y’know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painful time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm… The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets?",,,,,,Rachel
" All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 All right.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hm-mmm.,,,,,,Rachel
" That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go. (Gets up to leave, but Paul doesn’t move.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’s beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?",,,,,,Rachel
 What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!,,,,,,Rachel
" My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I wouldn’t do that!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! Oh my God!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn’t know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!",,,,,,Rachel
 What’s the other one?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh that’s right. You’re the talker. (They both reflect on that briefly) Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.",,,,,,Rachel
 No you don’t!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi. I’m back.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ah that’s great. No actually that’s… (In a sexy voice) That’s great! That’s really great! Y’know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.",,,,,,Rachel
 A lover?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah surfer?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, (sits on the counter and buttons her sweater to show some cleavage) get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn’t too revealing is it?",,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’t mean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming.,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m so glad, I’m so glad you shared. (Feeling his shoulder.) And I’m glad that you’re done. What do you say we umm… (Nods in the direction of the bedroom.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (who has just entered) Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I’ll dump you too!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! (Hugs him.) You guys are gonna be so happy!,,,,,,Rachel
 (gasps) Nice! One and a half carat easy.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah? Well, you should know. You’ve bought like a billion of ‘em.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh…,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, I’m so sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
 How about you guys? (Points to Phoebe and Joey.),,,,,,Rachel
 I think so.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?",,,,,,Rachel
" See? Now, he could date her.",,,,,,Rachel
 (breaking up) We’re just really…very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! Thank you!,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.",,,,,,Rachel
" (suddenly worried) Uh, wh-why?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hi!",,,,,,Rachel
" Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. (She introduces them.) He’s the head of my department.",,,,,,Rachel
 And I also brought my friend Joey…,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, y’know I-I don’t know where he is.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, y’know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Thank you. (Mr. Thompson walks away and after he’s left.) Okay, (writing her bid down) twenty dollars.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ugh! So close!,,,,,,Rachel
 What are you doing?,,,,,,Rachel
 Well now it’s an empty bar.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?! What?! What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey! It is an auction! You don’t guess, you buy!",,,,,,Rachel
 Joey! Sit down! (Pulls him down.),,,,,,Rachel
 What were you thinking?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Wh?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Why would a charity give away a free boat?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ugh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?",,,,,,Rachel
 How is you drinking helping the kids?,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey! Joey, good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (stopping him) Hey! You…can’t…leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!",,,,,,Rachel
" I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we’re gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you’re just gonna pay the difference.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Not great.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh great!,,,,,,Rachel
 (To Phoebe) Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.",,,,,,Rachel
 (To Joey) Okay. Okay. (Shushes him.),,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh…,,,,,,Rachel
 Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife’s name?,,,,,,Rachel
" Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, ""The Pam.""",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, uh-uh imagine this, ""The Mr. Bowmont.""",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. (She sits down next to him.) All right, you are settin’ sail up the Hudson! You’ve got the wind in your h—(sees that he’s bald)—arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you’ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin’! You can—ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you’re old, Cappy.",,,,,,Rachel
 (To Joey) What?! What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" But Joey you don’t have $20,000!",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Hey! (Sees Monica, gasps, and runs over to her.) Oh my God you’re here, let me see your hand!!",,,,,,Rachel
" Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?",,,,,,Rachel
 No! I’m so happy for them!,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m so happy and not at all jealous.,,,,,,Rachel
" I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah me too.,,,,,,Rachel
" (staring at him) Wh—no, but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.",,,,,,Rachel
 We’re gonna find love!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other.",,,,,,Rachel
 Exactly!,,,,,,Rachel
 You do?,,,,,,Rachel
 Who?,,,,,,Rachel
 Joey?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Are you serious?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40, you’re gonna marry Joey.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, seriously?",,,,,,Rachel
 Charming.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey you!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh thank you. Hey y’know, I’m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it?",,,,,,Rachel
" So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we’re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, ""What’s that?!""",,,,,,Rachel
 Exactly.,,,,,,Rachel
 What? Who?,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe?! Wait a—but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!",,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God, Phoebe!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin (does so) and I’m gonna right Ross on the other napkin (does so) and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?",,,,,,Rachel
 Pick one.,,,,,,Rachel
 You’re welcome.,,,,,,Rachel
 (reading) Joey! (Pause) We should just switch.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohhh, this is the least jealous I’ve ever been!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh hell, he’s done this three times! He knows what its about!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she’s even had time to…",,,,,,Rachel
" (To Monica) Yeah, you’re on your own.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" (quietly) Oh, thanks.",,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t know, y’know? I feel a little umm… No, y’know what? Never mind, I’m gonna be fine.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well thank you, you too.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh…,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I guess. I-I… I mean, do-do you think we’re ever gonna have that?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.",,,,,,Rachel
 Shake it off.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, absolutely. Y’know like it was umm…",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, just give me a minute! (Thinking) Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I know. Hey, y’know what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Oh no, not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh, we never had a bonus night!",,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know, bonus night. Y’know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah-yeah, we never had that,",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh honey, but it is just about…",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!,,,,,,Rachel
 Honey I swear it we just kissed.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay come on Phoebe, it’s nothing! Monica, come on!",,,,,,Rachel
 No!,,,,,,Rachel
" No-no, it’s really not huge.",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, you are not! You’re 31.",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look…",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" What do you think Monica meant when she said she didn’t want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.",,,,,,Rachel
" Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? (Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!",,,,,,Rachel
 I care!,,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?",,,,,,Rachel
 Am I going to let you watch me undress?,,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want to talk to anyone, especially me?",,,,,,Rachel
" No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, what are you talking about?",,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, y’know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh, Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder!",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain’t gonna happen!",,,,,,Rachel
" I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!",,,,,,Rachel
" (ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let’s go have s*x!",,,,,,Rachel
" We’re not gonna do this, all right? She’s just gonna think that we’re doin’ it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Who is it?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May we help you?",,,,,,Rachel
" All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!",,,,,,Rachel
 No you don’t know why!,,,,,,Rachel
 Because! Because I was sad.,,,,,,Rachel
" Look, I am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!",,,,,,Rachel
" Anyway sweetie, I am, I’m so sorry I ruined your night.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, so let’s get started on the wedding plans!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music…",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks…",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Aw.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Now Joey, what did the duck do?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey Joey, what ‘cha doing?",,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, did you eat my face cream?",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?",,,,,,Rachel
 (gasps) You found my book?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (She goes into her room.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Well what happened at dinner?,,,,,,Rachel
" Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!",,,,,,Rachel
" No, y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need, you don’t need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Do you even understand what off the rack means?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Well what?! How-how much is it?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!,,,,,,Rachel
" (starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.",,,,,,Rachel
 (quietly) Joey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well no, I don’t smell anything.",,,,,,Rachel
 Nothing!,,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you. (Exits.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Who are you supposed to be?,,,,,,Rachel
 Do you even know what a vicar is?,,,,,,Rachel
" (sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey, it’s enough alright?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it’s—I’m not—it’s just not funny anymore!",,,,,,Rachel
 All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?! Let’s do it!,,,,,,Rachel
" (starting to move closer to him) That’s right, I wanna do it with you! I’ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.",,,,,,Rachel
" (moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, I’ve been waitin’ so long to get on that body!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey; s*x me up!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, come on now, don’t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a rough ride! (He backs into the door.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, what?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah-yeah, did-didn’t you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm…",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.",,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.,,,,,,Rachel
 That is the Coast Guard.,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the lesson yet.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, (grabs some of the rigging) what’s this called?",,,,,,Rachel
 Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?,,,,,,Rachel
 No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?,,,,,,Rachel
" Time’s up, now you're dead.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game, Joey, you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!",,,,,,Rachel
" (laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.",,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t know. Y’know, they didn’t get us anything.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well hello! So, when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey?",,,,,,Rachel
 Why not?,,,,,,Rachel
 What? I was just trying to teach you.,,,,,,Rachel
" Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn’t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.",,,,,,Rachel
" Look Joey, I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom!",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, y’know what? I-I’m sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.",,,,,,Rachel
 I won’t boss you around.,,,,,,Rachel
" And, I’ll be nice.",,,,,,Rachel
 And—Joey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay Joey honey, you’re doing really good! All right, now I’m just gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which side is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?",,,,,,Rachel
 Right?,,,,,,Rachel
" It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a tough one.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of the boat.) The left!",,,,,,Rachel
 (yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.),,,,,,Rachel
" No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay Joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (angrily) No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!",,,,,,Rachel
 What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit!,,,,,,Rachel
 Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do not quit!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, wait did I—I just said Greens don’t quit didn’t I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens don’t quit?!",,,,,,Rachel
" No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you, I’m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, oh I’m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I’ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh, Joey, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
 Awww…,,,,,,Rachel
 Left.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh we’re not sailing.,,,,,,Rachel
 All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.) Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees what’s in the cooler.) Sandwiches!,,,,,,Rachel
 (hands him one) Here you go.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh wow! (She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the stuff falls out.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh whoops.,,,,,,Rachel
 That’s nice.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well that was umm…Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh no you don’t! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!",,,,,,Rachel
 What are you gonna do Pheebs?,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering, excitedly) Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You’ll never gonna believe what happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and…",,,,,,Rachel
 Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, so anyway I’m sittin’ in my office and guess who walks in.",,,,,,Rachel
 Joey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. (To Monica and Phoebe) It was Ralph Lauren! (Monica and Phoebe gasp) Ralph Lauren walked into my office!,,,,,,Rachel
 It’s the same story.,,,,,,Rachel
" (ignoring him) Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he’s so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 I got—I get a big pay raise!,,,,,,Rachel
 I get to hire my own assistant!,,,,,,Rachel
 (reading the resume) And you were at this job for four years?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?",,,,,,Rachel
" I’ve never interviewed anyone before. I’ve actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn’t the same thing.",,,,,,Rachel
" No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in, it was nice to meet you.",,,,,,Rachel
 All right. (Hilda exits) I’m a total pro!,,,,,,Rachel
" (seeing him) Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I’m sorry the models are actually down the hall.",,,,,,Rachel
" Really?! (Taking his resume) Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what’s—what is—what’s your name?",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh-huh, go on.",,,,,,Rachel
" That’s your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let’s-let’s just have a look-see here. (Looking at his resume)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh come on, what are you talking about? You’ve got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday’s, come on!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.) I’m sorry, it’s for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, you have an assistant right?",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I-I just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean I’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy…",,,,,,Rachel
 I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do.,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh-huh. No, I hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?,,,,,,Rachel
 Kinda.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh-ohh, thank you.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well…,,,,,,Rachel
 But I hired you!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! You-you got the job! You’re my new assistant!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
" Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, my-my new assistant was very happy that I hired my new assistant.",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m sorry Joey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, why would you do that?",,,,,,Rachel
" Tag? (He turns and looks at her.) Hi, who was that?",,,,,,Rachel
 Really? (Giggles.),,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second? (Goes into office.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (grabbing Phoebe) Okay. We’ll be right back. (They go into her office and she closes the door.),,,,,,Rachel
" All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I’m telling you…",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I’ve ever done. But I’m telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. (There’s a knock on the door.) Yes?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 Gay? Yeah. (Kathy leaves dejectedly.),,,,,,Rachel
 (noticing him) Hi! (Puts the pictures away.),,,,,,Rachel
" Well yeah, sure, what’s up?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh really?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, did you not want people to know that?",,,,,,Rachel
 Why’s that?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don’t want you to feel like you can’t tell me things. (Motions for him to sit down.)",,,,,,Rachel
 ‘Kay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" (Pause) Yeah, she’s gay.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey look-look, Phoebe’s talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, I thought that guy was married.",,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, if this guy’s going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I gotta get back to work.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.",,,,,,Rachel
" I am not gonna get fired, because I’m not gonna act on it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Why? Is he? He is! Isn’t he? He’s dating that slut in marketing!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well drop and give me ten more!",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?",,,,,,Rachel
" (startled) Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what’s up? I’m just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y’know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What’s up? (She has put on the backpack.)",,,,,,Rachel
 No. Why?,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain’t a locker room, okay? But, y’know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah. All right, back to work.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah Melissa, I don’t want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi Joey! What are you doing here?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, sure. Umm…here. (Hands him one.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I don’t think so Joe.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?",,,,,,Rachel
 How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I’ll pay.,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m not asking you to go on a date with him!,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, just-just he-he’s new in town and I know he doesn’t have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I’ll really appreciate it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh that’s nice.,,,,,,Rachel
 Wo-women? You mean like old women?,,,,,,Rachel
 (Pause) Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" That’s great! Wow man, so Joey must’ve really taught you some stuff huh?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know, all the women.",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it’s just—And I know he’s my assistant and I can’t date him—but it just bothers me, all right?!",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this dating tons of women thing is!",,,,,,Rachel
" I just don’t want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush—And I will get over it. It’s-it’s not like I love him, it’s just physical! But—I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. Sure. (Joey nods his head questioningly and Rachel nods no.),,,,,,Rachel
" (To Joey) So, will you talk to him?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, come on! I’ll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! (He hands her her mail) Thanks, hey so uh what’d you do last night?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah? Another night of bird-dogging the chickas?,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! I did not see that coming.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y’know?",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
 Sp-spoil?,,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I-I’m startin’ too.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes! Hell yes!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 I’d love to!,,,,,,Rachel
" (panics, turns around, picks up the phone, and pretend to talk on it) Hello?! (Listens) Oh, yeah! (To Tag) This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. (Tag leaves and she closes the door behind him, disgustedly.) Yeah!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! This is it! (She and Phoebe hold hands.) (To Phoebe) I really hope it’s you!,,,,,,Rachel
 Me too!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hypothetically!,,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-hmm.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing (A woman at the table behind them overhears Chandler’s name and starts listening closer), my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that…",,,,,,Rachel
 Fine!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I’m just—Wait a minute. If I’m your maid of honor that means you are Monica’s.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s!,,,,,,Rachel
 Why does it matter so much to you?!,,,,,,Rachel
 What-what if I marry Ross—Or Joey?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah but Phoebe…,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. Okay. It’s—since you’ve never done it before you can be Monica’s maid of honor.,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m gonna marry someone good y’know.,,,,,,Rachel
" Better than Chandler. (Phoebe exhales as if to say, ""Like what isn’t?"")",,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor!,,,,,,Rachel
 (shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!,,,,,,Rachel
 All right that’s it! I am maid of honor!,,,,,,Rachel
 How come you are?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Okay fine, y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. (Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, uh…",,,,,,Rachel
 …it’s gonna be okay!,,,,,,Rachel
" Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thanks!,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you judges.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
 Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage as… (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh… I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six-year-olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six-year-old.",,,,,,Rachel
" Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds it up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.",,,,,,Rachel
" Aw, thanks!",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where I’ve heard that before.)",,,,,,Rachel
" No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous—We’re gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the coin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi Pheebs.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y’know just in case…",,,,,,Rachel
" Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows Phoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here’s a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse) Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.",,,,,,Rachel
" And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry at weddings. (Starting to cry.) I’m just gonna grab a couple of these.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah…",,,,,,Rachel
 You do? Why?,,,,,,Rachel
" But Pheebs, y’know you earned it.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I was ten. I just developed early.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she’s gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets suddenly scared.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds a naked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God, sorry! (She closes the door and confronts Joey.)",,,,,,Rachel
 What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember, can’t I just tell her you’re a pig?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well forget it, I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
 (pause) Would you like some pancakes?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!",,,,,,Rachel
 I know!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh and I’ll call ya too!,,,,,,Rachel
 Bye!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Joey, I’m sorry I just couldn’t tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y’know we got to talking and I…",,,,,,Rachel
 Cupid.,,,,,,Rachel
" Look Joey, come on, she’s so perfect for you! I mean, she’s sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.",,,,,,Rachel
 Fine. (They start to walk away.),,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe!,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m sorry?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, there was. It was—there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read—Yes, there was.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well now what’s the rush?,,,,,,Rachel
 Well look who’s here!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.",,,,,,Rachel
 (does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why don’t you guys do something?!,,,,,,Rachel
 How did it go with Erin?,,,,,,Rachel
" (gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin’ about having kids. Oh my Joey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh, please don’t get married before I do.",,,,,,Rachel
 So how’s it goin’ with Joey?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.",,,,,,Rachel
 But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh, tramp!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, see ya.",,,,,,Rachel
" Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she’s not lookin’ for a serious relationship.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, she told me. She said she’s kind of a loner.",,,,,,Rachel
 Joey…,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell ‘em you’re not looking for a relationship.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?,,,,,,Rachel
 Do you want some pancakes?,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, I got 48.",,,,,,Rachel
 (counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... your food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.",,,,,,Rachel
" Seriously, it's moving!",,,,,,Rachel
 (gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I'm sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
" Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?",,,,,,Rachel
" When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?",,,,,,Rachel
 Interesting.,,,,,,Rachel
 Huh. A moo-point?,,,,,,Rachel
" (to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?",,,,,,Rachel
" You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 How are you holding up?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.,,,,,,Rachel
 So were you guys together a long time?,,,,,,Rachel
 Now that she broke up with you?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. Hmmmm.,,,,,,Rachel
" No…Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it…it has to work out.",,,,,,Rachel
" Because, uh—it has to.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug)",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, yeah, well, see, he… Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and…you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!",,,,,,Rachel
" No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?",,,,,,Rachel
" (she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk and they’re-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh look, there they go, okay. (She hurries in too)",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out",,,,,,Rachel
 (gasps) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 (uncovers the dog) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hi! How are you doing?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out.",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering, happily) Gooood morning!!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, why shouldn’t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!",,,,,,Rachel
" Come on, it’s not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.",,,,,,Rachel
 (pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly) We… We are not… …going to let it… be a problem.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well y’know, we did other stuff too. (Joey and Chandler start to giggle.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Monica come on, y’know I don’t sleep with guys on the first date!",,,,,,Rachel
 Anymore!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, thank you. That’ll be all. (The mail guy leaves and Tag starts to follow, but Rachel stops him.) (Excitedly) Wait! Wait! (Rushes over and closes the office-door.) Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us. (They kiss.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y’know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate. (She turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.)",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I’ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?",,,,,,Rachel
 (hugging him) So did you read your evaluation yet?,,,,,,Rachel
" (worried) Okay please, you’re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m thinkin’ no.,,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny tushie.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, ""Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision,"" and under Problems with Performance I wrote, ""Dear God, I hope not,"" and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.",,,,,,Rachel
" Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know, maybe they didn’t take it the way I meant it.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! Joey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ugh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.",,,,,,Rachel
 Let’s roll!,,,,,,Rachel
" (worried and shocked) Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything—minute. Okay. Fine. (To Tag) Abort the plan, abort the plan. (She start to usher Tag out.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates? (Holds up the box.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, (getting serious) what would happen exactly.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well…,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh no-no-no…,,,,,,Rachel
 You’re lookin’ at it upside down—y’know what? (Grabs the evaluation and throws it out.) It doesn’t matter.,,,,,,Rachel
 Whoa! I can’t believe you did that. That was really sweet.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, you could’ve lost your job.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you! You’re great! (They kiss.),,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 I… It just—it took me so long to get that desk organized.,,,,,,Rachel
 (looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.),,,,,,Rachel
 (freaking out) Oh my god!!,,,,,,Rachel
 You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.,,,,,,Rachel
 (to Monica) Did you know he was in there?,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Drums?,,,,,,Rachel
 (stopping at Phoebe’s entrance) Ha!,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.",,,,,,Rachel
" What are you talking about? I love them! (Looks into the cage) Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.",,,,,,Rachel
" What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?",,,,,,Rachel
 And that makes you angry because…,,,,,,Rachel
 Where did you get that?,,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe?,,,,,,Rachel
" Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!",,,,,,Rachel
" It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it's so much more fun with you.",,,,,,Rachel
 We did!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I would love to!",,,,,,Rachel
" Good, good, good, good, good. (She runs to the drums and gets the sticks)",,,,,,Rachel
 (with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage and puts the sticks into it) Done!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh wow! Look at this place!,,,,,,Rachel
 (yelling from another room) Oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
" (returning) Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?",,,,,,Rachel
 And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?,,,,,,Rachel
" Do you really not know where I’m going with this? (Phoebe nods, ""No."") It left! It’s one huge room!",,,,,,Rachel
 See?,,,,,,Rachel
" You can’t, because of the new skylight!",,,,,,Rachel
 So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?,,,,,,Rachel
 Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, it’s okay. I like living with Joey.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh please, I hate packing, it’s closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I’m really gonna miss living with you.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know. (They hug.) Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering with Phoebe) Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 (seeing the collection of characters.) Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny’s funeral in here.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
 I got it!,,,,,,Rachel
 Its back in cage!,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!",,,,,,Rachel
 (Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, y’know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I—(Chandler puts a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)—Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? (She reaches over to look at the label on the box.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief.",,,,,,Rachel
" Why, why not?",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.",,,,,,Rachel
" (taking a bite) Oh, I’m sorry, what?",,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, I think he’s still out. What’s wrong?",,,,,,Rachel
" (reading the note) ""Pheebs, can’t make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy."" (Laughs) Big Daddy?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" So just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?",,,,,,Rachel
" Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?",,,,,,Rachel
" It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling… (Pause) Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted.,,,,,,Rachel
" Momma’s Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. (They exit with the cheesecake.)",,,,,,Rachel
" What? Wait a minute, I didn’t pay, I thought you paid!",,,,,,Rachel
 (gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Braverman is still lying in front of her door.),,,,,,Rachel
 She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months.,,,,,,Rachel
 No that could kill her.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, so we’re protecting her.",,,,,,Rachel
 But we should move quick.,,,,,,Rachel
 Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.,,,,,,Rachel
 (taking a bite) Oh my God! That is so good!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. Do you want some? (He makes a disgusted noise and heads for his room, Chandler follows him in.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (with a mouthful) Mm-mmm. (Nods no.),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are dessert stealers! We are living outside the law!",,,,,,Rachel
 What?! What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Wait a minute!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don’t!",,,,,,Rachel
 You think I trust you with it?! No! We’re gonna split it! You take half and I take half!,,,,,,Rachel
" What? Oh, well then y’know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay! (Grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) All right, pick a half.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh for God sake just pick a piece!,,,,,,Rachel
" That’s also the smaller piece. (Puts the piece onto a plate.) Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don’t come crying to me if you eat your piece too fast. (As she’s saying that she is backing out the door, when she finishes she turns around to return to her place, stumbles and drops the cheesecake on the floor.) Oh!!!!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, come on now!",,,,,,Rachel
" No. No, you can’t.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh I don’t-I don’t know.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah actually, I think we’re gonna take off too. We rented a movie.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. (They leave, leaving just Joey and Ross.)",,,,,,Rachel
 You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. (They start to head for the bedroom) Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?",,,,,,Rachel
" No seriously, y’know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don’t get.,,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? (He starts laughing.) Tag! I’m serious! This isn’t funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, ""Must go out today,"" and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn’t want to seem too bossy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.",,,,,,Rachel
 Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!,,,,,,Rachel
" No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay get your coat! (They get their coats and start to leave. Rachel suddenly stops and sticks her hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhook this? (Her bra.) Nice work!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I’m talking about! You have to be organized! You’ve got newspapers! You’ve got magazines! You got—Ohh! (Finds a picture.) And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. (She goes into her office.)",,,,,,Rachel
" In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it (Looks down onto her desk and finds the folder with the Post-It on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave Tag) that said, ""Must go out today."" So you just keep looking in there! All right?",,,,,,Rachel
" Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?",,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It’s not a perfect world! Just go please.,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you. (He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottom drawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up the phone.) I still don’t get it.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh… (She looks for a place to set it on his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) …fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well yeah, I wish that you would. (He opens the top drawer.) Well, no it’s not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom one and he opens it. She doesn’t see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (thinks) Y’know, I don’t-I don’t know. Let me, let me check. (As she heads for her office, she stops glances over her shoulder at Tag, looks into her office, and finds the folder on her desk.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Can I see you in my office for a minute?,,,,,,Rachel
 You put these on my desk!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh really? So you’re saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?! (I think Dogbert should have a line here.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) I am so hot for you right now.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, y’know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.",,,,,,Rachel
 So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.,,,,,,Rachel
 And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.,,,,,,Rachel
 No?,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m sorry, Rosita? As in…",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?",,,,,,Rachel
 Stevie the TV?,,,,,,Rachel
" No! (Joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.) Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! (She tries pulling on the back of the chair, until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) You bitch!",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, Joey I am so sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, come on—Joey, I’ll buy you a new one! All right? We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair.",,,,,,Rachel
" But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? I mean y’know, she did always put…your comfort first.",,,,,,Rachel
 (grabbing her coat) Okay? You ready?,,,,,,Rachel
 You will like it!,,,,,,Rachel
 You don’t even know!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well look, if you don’t like this…(The audience’s laughter at Chandler’s progress cuts out the rest of Rachel’s line.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y’know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y’know, start the heeling process?",,,,,,Rachel
 That’s weird.,,,,,,Rachel
 It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s some explanation.,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, I really don’t…",,,,,,Rachel
 Well no.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, y’know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!",,,,,,Rachel
" That’s right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. (She sits down in the chair.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (grabbing a beer out of the chair’s fridge) I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, how’s…how’s the uh, miracle chair?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah? Wow! Y’know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey Chandler!,,,,,,Rachel
" How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?",,,,,,Rachel
" I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000. (Which is an actual product by the way, I’m not sure about the 3000 part.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, it’s a long story, but umm I broke Joey’s chair…",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohhhhh. That’s how it got fixed!,,,,,,Rachel
 Noo! (Laughs) Angels.,,,,,,Rachel
 What? Wh-hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!",,,,,,Rachel
" No Joe, no miracle.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! (Joey starts to get up.) No I take that back!",,,,,,Rachel
 No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere.,,,,,,Rachel
" The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!",,,,,,Rachel
 We’re the Cobras!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ahhhh….,,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Good ones?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?",,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know, I’m still 29 in Guam.",,,,,,Rachel
 Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?,,,,,,Rachel
" Look, y’know I know my life’s going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who’ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they’re thirty.",,,,,,Rachel
 There you go!,,,,,,Rachel
" Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!",,,,,,Rachel
 Nothing. I don’t want to do anything.,,,,,,Rachel
" Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? (To Phoebe, quietly) I know it’s really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.",,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know what? I am going to do something today. I’m not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I’m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.",,,,,,Rachel
 So what?! Y’know what? The way I see it—(Phoebe pulls out a hair from the back of her head)—Ow! Son of a bitch!!,,,,,,Rachel
" (glares at him) Get out, get out of my apartment.",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She’s coming!,,,,,,Rachel
 What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ahh!,,,,,,Rachel
 (opening it) A scooter! (She’s not happy.),,,,,,Rachel
" No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! It’s better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down as everyone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) That’s funny, yeah!",,,,,,Rachel
" (crying) No, I know! I get it! It’s funny!",,,,,,Rachel
" No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things. That’s why it’s so funny. (Runs into her room crying.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I feel fine, but I think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids…,,,,,,Rachel
 As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!,,,,,,Rachel
" So, if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35, I don’t have to get pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant…",,,,,,Rachel
" No, so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’s three years, that’s three whole years—Oh, wait a minute though. I’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I’d like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I’m thirty.",,,,,,Rachel
" No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!",,,,,,Rachel
 (To Chandler) I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey. (After she leaves.) Oh, poor Pheebs.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, I really don’t think…",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey Joey, can I…",,,,,,Rachel
" Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.",,,,,,Rachel
" Whatever! Okay, I’m not your mother.",,,,,,Rachel
 Not in the street!!,,,,,,Rachel
 (to Tag) Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I’m doing okay. I’m um…let’s talk.",,,,,,Rachel
 Umm…,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh Tag, umm…you’re such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don’t-I don’t…",,,,,,Rachel
" Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I’m past the point where I think I can y’know, just have fun.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, it is! But you’re just a kid! I mean you’re 25!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God! Y’know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I’m wishin’ for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I’m sorry. (They hug.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?",,,,,,Rachel
 (starting to cry) Ohh…,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, it’s just y’know…",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! I would love to read a poem.,,,,,,Rachel
 (crying) It’ll be a short one.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohhh…,,,,,,Rachel
" Wait, what do you mean you’re getting a new brain?",,,,,,Rachel
" She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, I mean I don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.",,,,,,Rachel
" (They both look behind them.) Well, I'd have to say gay.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, straight, and not subtle. (The man gets up and leaves.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.",,,,,,Rachel
" What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fall in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.",,,,,,Rachel
 What? Wait! Why…why do you get the story?,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! (Breaking up) And until now, I didn’t think I’d love again.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well umm, maybe we could uhh… (Grabs the phone) Ah-ha! Too slow!!",,,,,,Rachel
" No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.",,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t think so.,,,,,,Rachel
" (checking the speed dial) All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes okay. (Checking the speed dial again.) Well now see this isn’t telling us anything. (Reading the speed dial) Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat’s a steak house!,,,,,,Rachel
" (looking at the speed dial) Oh, I win! He’s got Barney’s on his speed dial.",,,,,,Rachel
 (showing Phoebe her phone) His new girlfriend!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi Pheebs!,,,,,,Rachel
 How are ya?,,,,,,Rachel
" Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy’s cell phone?",,,,,,Rachel
 And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?,,,,,,Rachel
 And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!,,,,,,Rachel
 You stole the phone!,,,,,,Rachel
" No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring?",,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh is it?! (She answers the cute guy’s phone.) Uhh, hello? (On her phone) Yes hi, is Rachel there? (On the other phone) Yes she is, just one moment please. (To Phoebe, holding out both phones.) It’s for me!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God! I bet that’s him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh (In a sexy voice) Hello? Or should I be (Happily) Hi! It’s Rach… (Phoebe knocks the phone out of Rachel’s hand, catches it, and answers it.) Would you stop doing that?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe! You can’t do th…,,,,,,Rachel
 You do know that I will be here when he comes over.,,,,,,Rachel
 You just said it!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh Phoebe!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! (Exits.),,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Well why shouldn’t I?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.",,,,,,Rachel
 (laughs) You’re not the man who left the cell phone.,,,,,,Rachel
 Is-is he coming? (Looks hopefully out the door.),,,,,,Rachel
 We’ll be right back sir.,,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t know!,,,,,,Rachel
 I know! (Realizes what Phoebe said.) What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" (turning and looking at Tom again) No-no they do but, you just have to wait.",,,,,,Rachel
" (fake disappointment) All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh…,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!",,,,,,Rachel
 (screaming) MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!! (Runs to Monica’s.),,,,,,Rachel
" God. You seem really, really nice.",,,,,,Rachel
 I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 You are so beautiful.,,,,,,Rachel
 (giggles) (To Ross) I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.,,,,,,Rachel
 No!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi! Hi Ben!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah go ahead.",,,,,,Rachel
 No. No.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ben, it's Rachel! (He closes the door.) But whatever.",,,,,,Rachel
" Awww, just like his daddy.",,,,,,Rachel
 What-what about Monica?,,,,,,Rachel
 (nervous) So it would just be me alone?,,,,,,Rachel
 Huh umm…,,,,,,Rachel
" Well that—y’know it’s just uh, I’ve never done that before. Me and him alone.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah I think so.,,,,,,Rachel
" Bye. (Ross exits.) Ahhh… (Silence) So this is fun, huh?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?",,,,,,Rachel
 Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. Well that’s pretty much all that we have—Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita? (Holds up a bottle of margarita mix.),,,,,,Rachel
 Water it is.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ben y’know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. ‘Cause I was, I was your daddy’s girlfriend.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I’m not.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey! We were not on a—Okay. That’s fine! Fine. Y’know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?",,,,,,Rachel
" (checks her watch) Fifty-two minutes. (Pause) So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don’t have to share stuff.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you’re one of those. But y’know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we’d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they’d put salt on their cereal.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah? You like that one?,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I’ve got a ton of these! Umm, oh here—Do you want a good one? Here’s a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? (Does so.) And then you say to person, I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they’re left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I-I-I-I’m funny Ben, but I’m not stupid. Okay?",,,,,,Rachel
 Coming.,,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-oh.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah? Did he pull the old… (She is waving her hand up and down her face. She’s thinking about the pencil mark.),,,,,,Rachel
 Oh that.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don’t think that’s just a little funny?!",,,,,,Rachel
 (looking at his mark) Yes.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well y’know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, ""What’s up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?""",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" I’d love that. I would loooove… (Carol goes to make the coffee and she sits down.) So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...",,,,,,Rachel
" I found him! (To Ben) Very funny, come here! (She sits down on the coffee table and Ben walks up.) That is exactly why I’ve come here to talk to you okay?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes oh—(To Ben)—Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben nods no.) No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben) Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?",,,,,,Rachel
 Don’t do that.,,,,,,Rachel
" Seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh damnit!,,,,,,Rachel
 No! Don’t say that! Don’t say that!,,,,,,Rachel
 No don’t! Go back to repeating!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh crap!,,,,,,Rachel
 So now what have we agreed?,,,,,,Rachel
 And-and what else?,,,,,,Rachel
 Very good.,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m just visiting my good friend Carol.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 Carol…Lesbian?,,,,,,Rachel
 What line?,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, maybe they are not funny to you…",,,,,,Rachel
 Or Carol! But they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!,,,,,,Rachel
" That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, ""I will be revenged?!""",,,,,,Rachel
" Fine. Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!",,,,,,Rachel
" Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!",,,,,,Rachel
 I gotta go! (Runs out.),,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don’t we Ben? (He nods yes.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, okay. (Ross has a sign on his back that reads ‘Poop.’) Wh—Ah-ha! (Ross stops and turns.) Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can’t do it.",,,,,,Rachel
" I can’t let him go out that way, he’s got a meeting. (To Ross) You’ve got something here on your back.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh I…,,,,,,Rachel
 No! Wait! Come on!,,,,,,Rachel
 No you guys… (She walks out into the hallway.),,,,,,Rachel
 EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! (She runs over to him and finds that it was a dummy and that she had been had.),,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! You look so beautiful!,,,,,,Rachel
 I do the same thing.,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m just kidding too. (Laughs) I’m getting married in December. (Turns away not happy with herself.),,,,,,Rachel
 Oh y’know what? Y’know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman’s and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.,,,,,,Rachel
" So, does this (the dress) come in another color or… (The store owner walks away.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (To Phoebe) So this is Brooklyn.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh they’re pushing! They’re pushing!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Well I…,,,,,,Rachel
 No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!,,,,,,Rachel
 No! You gotta hold my hand!!,,,,,,Rachel
 (seeing who’s trapped) Hey…,,,,,,Rachel
 You’re out of Diet Coke.,,,,,,Rachel
 You’re out of toilet paper!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I’m not saying that there’s any connection here y’know, but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, what is the other reason?",,,,,,Rachel
 Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid.,,,,,,Rachel
 (gasps) Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, stop that! Don’t kid about that! (Gasps) Will all the stars be there?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! Oh my God! I can’t go! I’m gonna be too nervous!,,,,,,Rachel
 No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m fourth! (Joey is startled.) Look at you with your little maple syrup award!,,,,,,Rachel
" What? No! It’s not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Grammy, Best New Artist.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh that’s great!,,,,,,Rachel
" So you’ll definitely get onstage, even if you don’t win.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well of course I do! But y’know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you’re up against the guy who survived his own cremation.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well Joey, you’ll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y’know? So it’s sorta like… (Does it, you’ll have to see it.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Y’know?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering from her room) Whoa what?,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
 Not right now.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 I didn’t. I got under him.,,,,,,Rachel
 I know! My God! Do you have your speech?,,,,,,Rachel
 Do you got your gracious loser face?,,,,,,Rachel
" Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!",,,,,,Rachel
 On TV?! Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God you stole her award!,,,,,,Rachel
 Joey I don’t think you know what behalf means.,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, you have got to take this back!",,,,,,Rachel
 (looking at the award) No! Joey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Do you really want an award you didn’t win?,,,,,,Rachel
 Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don’t want to win an award this way. You’re very talented. And someday you’re gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.",,,,,,Rachel
 All right? (He sets the award down.) Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
 I cannot believe I’m gonna meet Jessica Ashley!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, I’m totally cool! (She coolly knocks on the door)",,,,,,Rachel
 (coolly) Hey Jess.,,,,,,Rachel
 ‘Sup? (Joey glares at her.),,,,,,Rachel
 Absolutely.,,,,,,Rachel
 I’ll be out in a second.,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering from her room) Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay honey, you can finish this later we’re gonna be late. We gotta go.",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?",,,,,,Rachel
 (laughs) Well okay—Well don’t ruin it! Just play along at least!,,,,,,Rachel
 (To Phoebe) Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!,,,,,,Rachel
 She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday…,,,,,,Rachel
 Yesterday!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, Phoebe, this is impossible! We can’t do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There’s just too much to do! It’s impossible! We can’t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!",,,,,,Rachel
" (calmly) Okay. I’m sorry. You’re right, you’re right.",,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, I already, I already did.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Okay. (They sit down.) I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?",,,,,,Rachel
 4 o’clock. Food?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ooh great! Very Monica.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?",,,,,,Rachel
 We’re paying for this y’know.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?",,,,,,Rachel
 (pause) What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! What’s up Mon?,,,,,,Rachel
 Have at it.,,,,,,Rachel
 Are you makin’ him a sandwich?,,,,,,Rachel
" (To Phoebe, after Monica’s gone) We have to get her a present?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.",,,,,,Rachel
 (to her) Hi! I’m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I’m the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohhhh!,,,,,,Rachel
 That’s great!,,,,,,Rachel
 (to the woman) Excuse us for a minute. (They go into the kitchen.) You didn’t tell her to come?!,,,,,,Rachel
" No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come, and I was supposed to bring the cake!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Monica, we are so sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don’t have either.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ugh…,,,,,,Rachel
" What do you, what do you mean?",,,,,,Rachel
 Surprise…,,,,,,Rachel
 …Monica.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?",,,,,,Rachel
" (to the gang) Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don’t think I have the energy for this.",,,,,,Rachel
 (screaming) Melissa!,,,,,,Rachel
 Wh—(Turns and looks at the gang who’s staring)—Why don’t I tell you over here? (She walks Melissa away from the gang.),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no-no, no! It’s good! It’s all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!",,,,,,Rachel
 I will not! I’m the divisional head of men’s sportswear!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh please…,,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh tomorrow, oh I don’t know. Um…",,,,,,Rachel
 Shut up.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, wow thanks! (Reading the card) Oh you’re in real estate!",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! What do you do now?,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay! (Joins the rest of the gang.),,,,,,Rachel
" Shut up, that was my friend Melissa from college.",,,,,,Rachel
 She’s actually very sweet and we used to be very close.,,,,,,Rachel
 (To Monica) Yes.,,,,,,Rachel
 It’s not a big deal!,,,,,,Rachel
" No we weren’t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y’know, ended up…kissing for a bit.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh wow. Why don’t we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs. Monica just glares at her.) These pins aren’t for playing are they?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Stop picturing it!!,,,,,,Rachel
 That is not a problem.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there’s anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a few) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back.,,,,,,Rachel
 Some of them.,,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?",,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, well let’s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.",,,,,,Rachel
 (reading a tag) This one is uh Paul O’Neil.,,,,,,Rachel
" He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!",,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 It’s a pretty cool tux.,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" So Joey, I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding: do you need one?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, what are you going to wear?",,,,,,Rachel
 Huh. Does Monica know about this?,,,,,,Rachel
 Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, y’know what? I can’t. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey’s lewd version?",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit.",,,,,,Rachel
 It-it did!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m not saying that I’m a lesbian! I’m just saying that this happened!,,,,,,Rachel
 (shocked) Vanilla?!,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m not vanilla! I’ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, y’know what? If you don’t want to believe me about this, why don’t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. Oh, that’s great!",,,,,,Rachel
" (changing the subject) Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin’ Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.",,,,,,Rachel
" Remember?! We—come on, we both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops…",,,,,,Rachel
 …we went back to the house and we got really silly and we…we made out.,,,,,,Rachel
 How can you not remember us kissing?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Wh… Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn’t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin’ together?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah—but come on—Listen, I’m sorry I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn’t believe me.",,,,,,Rachel
 No!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you Phoebe.,,,,,,Rachel
 It happened! I am telling you it happened!,,,,,,Rachel
" What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I’m not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don’t remember that, maybe you will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (shocked) What?,,,,,,Rachel
 (moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!,,,,,,Rachel
 (moves away again) I-I-I-I’m just…I’m just a good kisser!,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m sorry!,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna…,,,,,,Rachel
 What the hell was that?!,,,,,,Rachel
 And?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well y’know what they say, the 23rd time’s the charm. (Chandler enters.) Aww, look at you all handsome!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.,,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t want to say.,,,,,,Rachel
 Diane Keaton.,,,,,,Rachel
 Monica what?,,,,,,Rachel
 What is the emergency?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, ""Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more.""",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that could’ve meant.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, what have you guys been up to?",,,,,,Rachel
 I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years.,,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us.,,,,,,Rachel
 Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.),,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
 OH MY GOD!!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!,,,,,,Rachel
 I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know, so you have to stop screaming!!",,,,,,Rachel
 (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down) HI!! Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!",,,,,,Rachel
" All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.",,,,,,Rachel
 Are you kidding?!,,,,,,Rachel
" I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we know?",,,,,,Rachel
 Joey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay!,,,,,,Rachel
 You really think it would be that different?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, things change.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, who's this little naked guy?",,,,,,Rachel
" Aww, look at the little thing.",,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, we were just talkin’ about you guys gettin’ married and how great it is.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, can we read them?",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" (To Monica) Monica, will-will you marry me?",,,,,,Rachel
" Wait a minute! (To Monica) You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you’re the only one who’s allowed to drive it.",,,,,,Rachel
 (shocked) You let Joey drive it?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! I can’t believe you lied to me.,,,,,,Rachel
 Take the top down did ya?,,,,,,Rachel
 Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she’s talking about! I am an excellent driver!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.",,,,,,Rachel
 I think she’s checking out your beehive Ross.,,,,,,Rachel
 Gimme the keys!,,,,,,Rachel
 Well no brush!,,,,,,Rachel
 (to the woman) Alimony. (Runs outside.),,,,,,Rachel
" Ahhh! (Gets in.) Ooh, nice!",,,,,,Rachel
 My God!,,,,,,Rachel
 Just washing the windshield. (She turns on the wipers forcing Ross off of the hood.),,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Look Ross, if you’re so freaked out, just get in the car!",,,,,,Rachel
 All right. (She starts off.),,,,,,Rachel
 What are you doing?! Get in the front!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my…,,,,,,Rachel
 God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Ross you’re so tense! You just gotta relax, okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax… (She takes her hands off of the wheel.)",,,,,,Rachel
" I am not horsing around, okay? I am Porsching around.",,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-oh. (She starts to pull over.),,,,,,Rachel
 Really? You think so?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I’ll go under, you go over!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh come on Ross!! (She tries to switch places with him and goes under his leg.),,,,,,Rachel
" (sexily) Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yes, absolutely! Y’know, it’s weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh…well I probably shouldn’t tell you the rest.",,,,,,Rachel
" (handing it to him) Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oops sorry, my mistake.",,,,,,Rachel
" Really?! You think so? Y’know, I had just rolled out of bed.",,,,,,Rachel
 Y’know you’re-you’re probably wondering about the old date on there.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 I bet you’re a Gemini.,,,,,,Rachel
 Taurus?,,,,,,Rachel
 Virgo?,,,,,,Rachel
 Sagittarius?,,,,,,Rachel
" I knew it! I knew it, ahh….",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
 I won’t speed.,,,,,,Rachel
 I promise.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh well…,,,,,,Rachel
 Remind me to introduce you to someone!,,,,,,Rachel
 Fourth gear!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o’clock position.,,,,,,Rachel
 It’s a different guy!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
 (pause) You have a son!,,,,,,Rachel
 (checking her watch) Op! We gotta go! (The girls stand up.),,,,,,Rachel
 What‘cha doing Mon?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! Those are all the things I’m responsible for!,,,,,,Rachel
 The commercial?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh that’s great!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.",,,,,,Rachel
 You’re gonna be late! Go! Go! (He runs out.),,,,,,Rachel
 Mexico?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! But I don’t know what he looks like!,,,,,,Rachel
 Man in the black dress… (Monica walks away and Rachel looks around to find a woman in a black dress.) (To her) Hi! I’m Rachel! I’m a friend of Monica and Chandler’s!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh I get it! A…man…duh!,,,,,,Rachel
 I’ll do it.,,,,,,Rachel
 I said I’ll do it!,,,,,,Rachel
 Monica! I’m not gonna screw it up!,,,,,,Rachel
 Well of course that is what I’m here for!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ugh! (To Phoebe) What grandmother?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" She’s steaming her dress, why? What’s up?",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 (reading the note) Tell Monica I’m sorry.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah but, maybe it’s not what we think. Maybe it’s tell Monica I’m sorry I…drank the last of the milk.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 (closing the door) Ross said there’s still no word from Chandler.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.,,,,,,Rachel
" God! Don’t—We can’t let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she’ll be in the gown and then he won’t show up and then she’s gonna have to take off the gown…",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It’s just…It’s just so sad!,,,,,,Rachel
 I know. I know. Oh God. (Looking around) There’s no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh thank you! (Wiping her nose.) Oh God! (She throws it out.) Can I have another one?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh God I just cannot imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn’t show up!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I mean she’s gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, ""Oh that poor girl."" Y’know? Then she’ll have to come back here and live all alone.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
" No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay?,,,,,,Rachel
 No. Why?,,,,,,Rachel
 Anything?,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, we’ve got to tell her he’s gone. (Starts to leave.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, she’s gonna start getting ready soon!",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, well how much time do you need?",,,,,,Rachel
 One hour.,,,,,,Rachel
 Then why do you ask?!,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, I’ll see you guys later.",,,,,,Rachel
 I’ll figure something out.,,,,,,Rachel
 Thanks.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.",,,,,,Rachel
 Umm… I’m never gonna getting married!,,,,,,Rachel
" No Monica! I’m serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.,,,,,,Rachel
 The nights are the hardest. (Checks her watch.) But then the day comes! And that’s every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again…,,,,,,Rachel
 I know. At dusk. That’s such a hard time for me.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. But wait!,,,,,,Rachel
 Let’s go to lunch.,,,,,,Rachel
 Right.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh good God! I’ve fallen down! (She trips and falls.),,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Alright. (Gets up.) Honey listen. When I tell you what I’m about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.",,,,,,Rachel
 We can’t find Chandler…(Phoebe sticks her head and motions that they found Chandler)—‘s vest. We can’t find Chandler’s vest.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
 You look so beautiful.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hello?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, we got him back. Everything’s fine.",,,,,,Rachel
 What? Why? Where are you?,,,,,,Rachel
 Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh! Joey, I have to go.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! (They turn the corner.) Well, y’know. I mean there’s no way Joey’s gonna make it in time. So I’m gonna go through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It’s a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.}(The happy couple emerges.) Congratulations. (To the best man and maid of honor) Mazel Tov! (The rabbi emerges.) Hi! Oh, great hat. (He’s wearing an interesting hat and she takes him over to talk.) Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! Yeah. They’re…they’re-they’re my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.",,,,,,Rachel
 (leaning in) As are you…,,,,,,Rachel
 Go on! Go on. (She turns back to Chandler.),,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, who is it?! (Phoebe rolls her eyes.)",,,,,,Rachel
 For you. (Chandler leaves.),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can’t deal with this just quite yet.",,,,,,Rachel
" You said that she was, I just didn’t disagree with you.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! (They smile and the picture is taken.) Oh by the way?,,,,,,Rachel
 James Brolin?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.,,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
 No!,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh! Look honey y’know what? I haven’t told him yet, so until I do I don’t think I should tell anybody else.",,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh y’know what honey? Let’s not talk about that right now?,,,,,,Rachel
" Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey! Y’know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they’re supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!",,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t know! Maybe they have tools.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, maybe that’s, maybe that’s really brave.",,,,,,Rachel
 Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well.,,,,,,Rachel
 (starting to cry) I don’t know.,,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without Monica noticing. It doesn’t work.) Oh that’s-that’s actually how the French drink it.",,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t know. I don’t know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don’t want to make. (Takes another sip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 How many ways are there to do that?,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, I’ll-I’ll take it again when I get home.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you guys are so great.",,,,,,Rachel
" Wh—Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.",,,,,,Rachel
 How much longer?,,,,,,Rachel
" 30 seconds, okay.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh I know. I know. (They hug.),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh wait! Y’know what? I can’t, I can’t look at it. I can’t. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! (Pause) That is—that’s great—that is really great-great news. (Pause) Y’know ‘cause the whole not being ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way it was supposed to be. (Starts to cry.) God.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thanks. (Crying) God this is so stupid! (Pause) How could I be upset over something I never had? It’s negative?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Are you sure?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh-oh, that’s a risky little game!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby! (They all hug.),,,,,,Rachel
" Ah, it’s still not the time.",,,,,,Rachel
" Listen y’know what sir? For the last time, I don’t care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!",,,,,,Rachel
 Are you joking? Check out is not ‘til noon and he has a good (checks her watch) eleven minutes left.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best s*x we ever had. Until y’know, he screamed out Radisson at the end.",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
 Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they?,,,,,,Rachel
" Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ew! No!,,,,,,Rachel
 Well then you have his baby.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I’m not gonna ask him for anything.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Joey! Joey! No, it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody pregnant!",,,,,,Rachel
 Not yet.,,,,,,Rachel
" No! Phoebe, it’s not Gunther.",,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven’t told him yet and I don’t think I can tell him at all now!,,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, ‘I’m gonna tell the father today’ and then bam!",,,,,,Rachel
" No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!",,,,,,Rachel
" I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.",,,,,,Rachel
" What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God… Oh, he’s in there right now?",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, let’s rip!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh Phoebe!,,,,,,Rachel
" Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y’know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it’s just not the right time.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Tag…,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m having a baby.,,,,,,Rachel
 You can go.,,,,,,Rachel
 Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh wow, you didn’t even try to unhook my bra!",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I will. I’m just not up for it tonight.",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m not?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" No! Joey, oh you’re so sweet. You’re so-so sweet, honey. But I’m not, I’m not looking for a husband.",,,,,,Rachel
" Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. (Exits.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Oh good you’re still here!,,,,,,Rachel
 I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon! (Hugs Monica.),,,,,,Rachel
 And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. (They all look at her expectantly) What? What? What?,,,,,,Rachel
 How?! How do you know?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I’m so relieved you guys know.",,,,,,Rachel
 I know! (They hug.),,,,,,Rachel
 (breaking the hug) You’re all gonna be aunts and uncles.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I’m gonna tell Ross!,,,,,,Rachel
 Well I was gonna tell him that I’m-I’m gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what’s-what’s the first thing that I say? (They all pause to think.) Okay great! Thanks. (She starts to leave.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (seeing him) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi. (He helps her up.) Umm, I think there’s something that we really need to talk about.",,,,,,Rachel
 You do?,,,,,,Rachel
 (warily) Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 (confused) What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Seriously. What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, y’know what? Can I, can I talk now?",,,,,,Rachel
" (touches his knee) I’m pregnant. (Ross stops.) Ross? (Ross is staring off into space.) Ross? (Ross is still frozen) Okay, whenever you’re ready. (Sits back and opens her magazine.) And you’re the father by the way—but you got that…",,,,,,Rachel
 (closes her magazine) Can I get you some water?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want. (Ross nods.)",,,,,,Rachel
" I know. I know, but y’know condoms only work like 97% of the time.",,,,,,Rachel
 They do!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms.,,,,,,Rachel
" Listen, y’know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out…",,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know what? Let’s, let’s talk later.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, y’know maybe I should come back… (Starts to leave.)",,,,,,Rachel
 (stops) Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" (sighs) If I said I was, would you judge me?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. (The nurse exits.) Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn…",,,,,,Rachel
 (shocked) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I’ve kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay Ross that’s fine, but can you please stand near my head?",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!,,,,,,Rachel
 What married?,,,,,,Rachel
" What, because that’s your answer to everything?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, maybe if you’re in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?",,,,,,Rachel
 Excuse me?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 I can too eat by myself!,,,,,,Rachel
 When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh please, you inhale your food!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.",,,,,,Rachel
 I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow. There it is, I see it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t see it!,,,,,,Rachel
 I can’t see it!,,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can’t even see my own baby!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. Oh, it’s beautiful. I see it now.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I don’t see it!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" That’s it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! I can’t believe that’s our baby.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, everything went great.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, I know I couldn’t see it either at first, but it’s right umm… (Starts to cry) Ross, I lost it again.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 Welcome home.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there ‘cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.",,,,,,Rachel
" And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.",,,,,,Rachel
 What is?,,,,,,Rachel
 That-that you came on to me?,,,,,,Rachel
" But you did! I mean, let’s be honest.",,,,,,Rachel
 You know you kissed me first.,,,,,,Rachel
 I was sending you signals?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands. (Ross raises his hand and no one else.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, ‘cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?",,,,,,Rachel
" No please, show me how I begged you!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh Ross!,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had s*x with you and I taped it? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the p0rn king of the west village.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with her shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They all yell again.) You don’t want to see this do you?,,,,,,Rachel
 I am not gonna show you this!,,,,,,Rachel
 I wanna see it.,,,,,,Rachel
" Clearly you don’t want people to see this tape. Now I don’t want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don’t people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ahh, I don’t believe you. I think you don’t want them to see you begging me. (Goes to put the tape in the VCR)",,,,,,Rachel
" Ah, a little preview!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, here we go. (Pushes play.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (on tape) Oh, thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?",,,,,,Rachel
 There I am.,,,,,,Rachel
" (on tape) I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I…",,,,,,Rachel
 (on tape) I-I know—I had put them in…in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today.,,,,,,Rachel
 Kinda hurtin’ my hand though.,,,,,,Rachel
" (on tape) (Ross hands her a glass of wine) I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! (Mimicking Monica) ""Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!"" (She tilts her wine glass above and moves it back and forth across the invitations) Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh…oh-oh-oh…",,,,,,Rachel
 (on tape) Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.,,,,,,Rachel
" (on tape) Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would’ve gone through with it? Y’know, if we hadn’t gotten caught. Do you think we would’ve done it?",,,,,,Rachel
 (on tape) Oh I wanted to.,,,,,,Rachel
 (on tape) Interesting.,,,,,,Rachel
" (on tape) Oh yeah, sure.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, in about ten seconds you’re gonna see him kiss me.",,,,,,Rachel
 (on tape) Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, get ready to see some beggin’!",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 What are you talking about?!,,,,,,Rachel
 How do you know about that story?!,,,,,,Rachel
 I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!,,,,,,Rachel
" No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.",,,,,,Rachel
" So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?",,,,,,Rachel
 It was an amazing night.,,,,,,Rachel
 You think it looked amazing?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, me neither. Yet…",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, it would be really weird.",,,,,,Rachel
 Good luck to you.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh please. (He does so.),,,,,,Rachel
 You are undressing very quickly.,,,,,,Rachel
 That’s what I was gonna say.,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend.,,,,,,Rachel
 Have you been working out?,,,,,,Rachel
" Really? Wow, this is so much better than I…",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh God!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, make it stop!",,,,,,Rachel
 Make it stop!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Have to make it stop!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Well don’t—What happened to Jessica’s body?!,,,,,,Rachel
 You don’t know do you?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! (Motions to Joey’s co-star.),,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know, he thinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. (Starts stroking his arm) And uh, and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that, I’m just stroking your arm.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, we’re leaving. Bye Kash.",,,,,,Rachel
 Say hi to Wally.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 I thought I was a complete idiot.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?",,,,,,Rachel
" Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all!",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. ""Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon,"" or ""I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?""",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, I can’t. I got a date.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah—Ooh! Earrings! (Goes into her room.),,,,,,Rachel
 (entering from her room) Hey guys do you think this is too slutty—Hi Kash!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! All right, I’ll see you guys later.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well I’m alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?",,,,,,Rachel
 I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well better than you, but y’know still not what you want.",,,,,,Rachel
" He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, ""Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch.""",,,,,,Rachel
 Doesn’t he?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 (thinks then gasps) Chandler M. Bing?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God. (Laughs),,,,,,Rachel
 Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. This is hard.,,,,,,Rachel
 Thanks sweetie.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh you did, there are twenty in here.",,,,,,Rachel
 Good night.,,,,,,Rachel
 Please tell me you’re not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it, because soon she won’t be able to fit into it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ahh!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y’know, ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts.",,,,,,Rachel
" (to them) Just a minute!!! (She takes the candy and opens the door to two parents, a witch, a clown, and a cowgirl.) Look at you guys! Wow! You are a very scary witch. (Gives her candy.)",,,,,,Rachel
 And you are a very funny clown. (Gives him candy.),,,,,,Rachel
" (to the cowgirl) And you are so in style right now. Y’know, I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don’t suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but…",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. Sure. (Throws some in her bag and she walks away as Phoebe, dressed as Supergirl walks up and eyes Monica who eyes her back.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (To Monica) Oh, you did this to him?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! (Opens the door to reveal a ballerina) Well you’re just the prettiest ballerina I’ve ever seen.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh… Oh, honey here. Take it all. (Pours the entire large bowl into her bag and closes the door.) Monica! We need more candy?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah I know, but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave her everything.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! Y’know what honey, we’re actually out of candy right now. But someone just went out to get some and I have been giving out money but I’m out of that too. Hey, can I write you a check?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, what’s your name?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, I’m just gonna write this out to cash.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey Mona!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet.,,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.",,,,,,Rachel
 Gotta go! (Opens the door to a boy in a cape.) Hi! Wow! There you go! (Hands him some candy.),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we’ve got candy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, that-that’s not your choice. Happy Halloween!",,,,,,Rachel
 Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?,,,,,,Rachel
 You shut up!,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!",,,,,,Rachel
" (To Joey) Yeah I know—I’m good—I got it! (Joey slowly backs away.) (To the boy) Now wait a minute, I’ve got one more thing I have to say to you…oh right! Shut up!",,,,,,Rachel
 No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook! (Grabs her checkbook and runs after him.),,,,,,Rachel
" Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!",,,,,,Rachel
 Really? You think that’s all it is?,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! What did he do?,,,,,,Rachel
 I can’t. I’m busy. I’m apartment hunting.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I can’t live with Joey once the baby comes. I don’t want my child’s first words to be, (in a baby’s voice) ""How you doin’?""",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I haven’t discussed it with him yet, but I know he’s gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.",,,,,,Rachel
 Not so much.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah that would really be great.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn’t. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.,,,,,,Rachel
 Shall we?,,,,,,Rachel
" And I’m Rachel, an admirer of the building.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ahh.,,,,,,Rachel
 So she’s really not dead.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hmm. Do you think—Could you tell me if she’s hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 How was the game?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh but Joey, I have to go. There’s no room for a baby here.",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, it’s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there’s a screaming baby around.",,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, it’s so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can’t do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.",,,,,,Rachel
 I know.,,,,,,Rachel
 I do too a little bit.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 You gave them to me!,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.",,,,,,Rachel
 What bra?,,,,,,Rachel
 You mean the one that you’re wearing? (Adjusts Monica’s pink bra strap as Monica looks down her shirt.),,,,,,Rachel
 What is this?,,,,,,Rachel
" You’re so sweet. (Notices something in the crib.) Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy! (A stuffed penguin wearing a ski jacket, goggles, and hat.)",,,,,,Rachel
" But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it’s going to be loud.",,,,,,Rachel
 It’s gonna be up all night!,,,,,,Rachel
 It’s gonna poop!,,,,,,Rachel
 What about all the women you want to bring home?,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, are you sure?",,,,,,Rachel
 I want me to stay too.,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you. (They hug.) Oh Joey and look at this crib! It’s so cute!,,,,,,Rachel
 Are you serious—Really?! It’s in such good condition.,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! Whoa-whoa what’s under the covers?,,,,,,Rachel
 It’s moving.,,,,,,Rachel
 It’s still—(Screams)—It’s got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I’m gonna stay here.,,,,,,Rachel
 (coming from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs?,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, no, I’ll be there too.",,,,,,Rachel
 No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven’t told him I’m pregnant yet.,,,,,,Rachel
 ‘Cause I know he’s gonna flip out and I hate it when he’s angry.,,,,,,Rachel
 What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he’d make me eat the entire pack.,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
 (panicking) No you don’t.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well actually umm…,,,,,,Rachel
" (To Phoebe) In case you didn’t notice, that is a scary man.",,,,,,Rachel
" This was such a huge mistake. I can’t tell him Phoebe. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t…",,,,,,Rachel
" No it’s okay, this is what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, that is the…baby’s problem. (Dr. Green returns.) Oh, everything okay with the waiter?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well… Umm, I got TiVo.",,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, it’s Ross. It’s Ross. You like Ross. (He just shakes his head.) Oh daddy, I hope you’re okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. You’re gonna—This is your first grandchild! You’re gonna be a poppy!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Who?,,,,,,Rachel
 February 2nd!,,,,,,Rachel
" I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn’t want him to start yelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour.",,,,,,Rachel
" All right here he comes. I’m gonna do this, I’m gonna tell him, I’m gonna be strong.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
" Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! (Hugs him and Phoebe glares at her.) Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.",,,,,,Rachel
 There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m sorry daddy.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes. Yes, he says I’m damaged goods.",,,,,,Rachel
 (quietly) Oh no…,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh okay, I’ll fix that to. What’s her e-mail address?",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, I promise. I’ll fix this. I swear. I’ll-I’ll-I’ll-I’ll talk to her.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I’m so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You’re gonna have to tell me how you did that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Um…But—Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh we just—we drove each other crazy!,,,,,,Rachel
" I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!",,,,,,Rachel
" Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is. (Rubbing his shoulder.)",,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? (Mona looks at her.) I am so gonna leave right now. (Ross opens the door for her and she leaves.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Forgot my purse! (Sees them kissing.) Oh, you guys made up. (To Mona) He’s a good kisser isn’t he? (Ross goes to close the door on her.) I’m going! (Quickly leaves and Ross locks the door.)",,,,,,Rachel
 About an hour ago.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes! (She gets up and sets the phone on the counter without hanging it up.) Bye daddy. (Phoebe and her leave.),,,,,,Rachel
 (looking at her fingers) Oh my…God! Let me see that! (Grabs the book from him.),,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Pheebs that’s so sweet—(Grabs a pair of pants)—Ooh, those are so cute!",,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow! I don’t remember him. Honey, are you sure you’re not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh that’s nice.,,,,,,Rachel
 Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering, carrying a baking dish) Hi!",,,,,,Rachel
" (sees Will) Oh my God Monica, who is that?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on. (We see Will angrily staring at Rachel.) Oh my God, he’s… Look at the way he’s just staring at me. I think he’s trying to mouth something to me, but I can’t make it out. (Will mouths, ""I hate you."")",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! Will, right?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi! I’m Rachel Green.,,,,,,Rachel
" Really?! Aren’t you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis’ graduation party?",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you!,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?",,,,,,Rachel
 What? (Joey starts offering Ross some turkey.) Oh y’know what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m sorry. What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, I’m sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m-I’m—I had no idea. I’m sorry. I…,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I’m real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school…",,,,,,Rachel
 You had a club?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?",,,,,,Rachel
 (To Ross) So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?,,,,,,Rachel
 So who else was in this club?,,,,,,Rachel
" So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay Monica, did you know about this?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?,,,,,,Rachel
 What rumor?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ross!,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 (shocked) Oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
 What?! You heard that?! (Goes and stands behind Joey.),,,,,,Rachel
 Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn’t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.),,,,,,Rachel
" Monica, how come you never told me this?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Joey stop staring! There’s nothing there! It’s not true!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! (Hits him and storms out.),,,,,,Rachel
" (entering carrying a book) Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, ""Dear Rach, you’re such a good person."" Not girl! Person!",,,,,,Rachel
" (reading what he wrote again) ""Dear Rach, you’re a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie."" (Will laughs.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes!,,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y’know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, there’s a picture of her in the yearbook actually.",,,,,,Rachel
 Wh—Phoebe!!,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, y’know—Fine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow…,,,,,,Rachel
 She’s right.,,,,,,Rachel
 You can keep those pants by the way.,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! (Notices the boots) Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!,,,,,,Rachel
 Return them?! Shh! They’re gonna hear you!,,,,,,Rachel
 (pause) He’s talking to the baby.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I’ll see you later.",,,,,,Rachel
 Bye. (She gets up to leave but is stopped by Joey),,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.",,,,,,Rachel
 I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors…,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?! Oh my God! I’m successful!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes! I’d love to! Have her come by the office.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi Monica!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi boots.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ahh…,,,,,,Rachel
 Well-well you can give them to me! I haven’t felt my feet in years!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Joey, I’m hardly a…",,,,,,Rachel
 Right! Hi Dina!,,,,,,Rachel
 Nice to meet you. (They shake hands.),,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. All right Dina, well let’s talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let’s see, there’s design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there’s-there’s sales, which is great because you get to travel…",,,,,,Rachel
 (stunned) And there’s marketing…,,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, it’s going to be okay. He’s been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that’s what the meatball sub is for. (She gives Dina a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, why don’t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.",,,,,,Rachel
 Joey…there’s something that you…should know. Dina?,,,,,,Rachel
 (To Dina) Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! (She quickly sets the sandwich in front of him.),,,,,,Rachel
 What?! Dina…,,,,,,Rachel
 I know.,,,,,,Rachel
 What college was that Dina?,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, what are you doing?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh Joey this is crazy!,,,,,,Rachel
" All right Joey! That is enough! (Grabs him and pulls him away from Bobby and Dina) Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it’s not legal. Okay? They-they don’t have a marriage license, they don’t have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!",,,,,,Rachel
 You’re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.,,,,,,Rachel
 Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! (To Bobby and Dina) Right?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, come on kids! A little help here!",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?",,,,,,Rachel
 (To Dina) Really? (Nods her head at Bobby.),,,,,,Rachel
 Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?,,,,,,Rachel
 So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay Bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment. (Drags Bobby away from Joey and Dina.)",,,,,,Rachel
 No! Seriously! What’s wrong with you?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe?,,,,,,Rachel
" Look at that guy by the window, wow!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it’s like every guy I see—I mean look here. (Points behind them) Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I’m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?! So this has happened to you?,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa’s lap.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, y’know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I’ll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y’know who I’m talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers… (Stops when she realizes it was her.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, you are.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?",,,,,,Rachel
" Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!",,,,,,Rachel
 No. I’m very comfortable.,,,,,,Rachel
" No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Well would you like me to lie down on the table?,,,,,,Rachel
 Do you feel it too?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, even this is turning me on!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?",,,,,,Rachel
 Uh Ross? You asked me that.,,,,,,Rachel
" I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.",,,,,,Rachel
 You gave her a key to your apartment?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. (They go into the kitchen.),,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe no!,,,,,,Rachel
" No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes. Hi, I’d like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. (Joey enters.) I’ll call you back.",,,,,,Rachel
 It’s just the pizza place.,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m sorry honey, I’m just having a, having a rough day.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh you really, you really just don’t want to hear about it.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put this umm, erotically charged.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. So y’know, I have all of these feelings and I don’t know what to do about them, because I can’t date like a normal person, which is fine because I don’t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just s*x, y’know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really so…hard…to find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I gotta get up early and it’s almost seven o’clock.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, good night!",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) I didn’t ask you to do it!,,,,,,Rachel
 You’re Joey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Right back at ya!,,,,,,Rachel
 And so bad. I don’t even know what you’re talking about because I didn’t ask you to do anything!,,,,,,Rachel
 No!,,,,,,Rachel
 That’s the end of this conversation!,,,,,,Rachel
 Never happened! Good night!,,,,,,Rachel
 They made you head of the department!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, Paul’s Café. They got great food and it’s really romantic.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing—Oh! Take her dancing!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin’ all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I’m not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it’s so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.",,,,,,Rachel
 Huh?,,,,,,Rachel
" What?! Joey, you don’t want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.",,,,,,Rachel
 (interrupting) Okay! I’ll go with ya! I’ll go! I’ll go with ya.,,,,,,Rachel
 All right?,,,,,,Rachel
 Joey? Could you get that? (There is no answer and she goes and opens the door to Joey.) What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they’re my favorite. Thank you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I’m going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I’m wearing underwear that goes up to about…(She snaps the waistband on her underwear that is just slightly below her breasts)…there.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, actually that’s my roommate’s.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ah yes, but he’s very protective of me so you’d better watch yourself.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hm-mmm.,,,,,,Rachel
" (laughs) Yeah, but I’m pretty sure he’s gay.",,,,,,Rachel
" Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?",,,,,,Rachel
" Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?",,,,,,Rachel
" Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date—Oh, I almost forgot. I didn’t pay you the rent check.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?,,,,,,Rachel
 I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God. And that works?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you poor little famous man.",,,,,,Rachel
" (looks interested) Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!",,,,,,Rachel
 Alright. So where’d you grow up?,,,,,,Rachel
" Come on, just answer the question!",,,,,,Rachel
 And so were-were you close to your parents?,,,,,,Rachel
 Why not?,,,,,,Rachel
 (sympathetic) Oh. (Starts rubbing his wrist with her fingers.) It’s gotta be rough.,,,,,,Rachel
 Huh?,,,,,,Rachel
" Thank you! And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.",,,,,,Rachel
 And now you’re watching me walk away.,,,,,,Rachel
 I am not gonna answer that!,,,,,,Rachel
" No one! They are my friends, I wouldn’t punch any of them.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, but I don’t know why. Look at me, I’m having such a wonderful time!",,,,,,Rachel
 I know!,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan.",,,,,,Rachel
" So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?",,,,,,Rachel
 How do you do that?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
" No, I don’t want to tell you.",,,,,,Rachel
 Because it’s embarrassing.,,,,,,Rachel
" (laughs) Okay. All right, stand up. (They do so.) Well, when we’re at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, ""Hmmm."" Okay, I know it doesn’t sound like anything, but I swear it works.",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.",,,,,,Rachel
" …you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, why didn’t you just take a cab?",,,,,,Rachel
 Well you’re not gonna be able to keep doing this.,,,,,,Rachel
 You what?,,,,,,Rachel
 Right. Wow!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?",,,,,,Rachel
 Relax! It’s not like it’s Citizen Kane!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah I know it’s really boring, but it’s like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well don’t you have that big date tonight?,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey Joey, can I ask you something?",,,,,,Rachel
" After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?",,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t know! (Pause) I’m-I’m kinda thinking it-it was the lobster…,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?! How come we didn’t cross paths?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh God! Thank God you’re home! I’m watching Cujo.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!,,,,,,Rachel
" No! No! Seriously, what’s wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?,,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know, I never thought I’d say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies. (Joey brings over a stool at sits on it next to Rachel who’s in the big chair.) What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. (Pushes play.) Okay, that’s him! That’s him! That’s Cujo! That’s Cujo!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God….What’s he gonna do now? I can’t watch! (Drags Joey closer to her and cowers into his chest.) Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren’t you scared?",,,,,,Rachel
" (coming from her room) Hi, sweetie.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! Oh, Ross, don’t forget, we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!,,,,,,Rachel
 Popular.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay! I was thinking if it’s a girl, how about Sandrine? It’s French.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay fine, what do you have?",,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.",,,,,,Rachel
" I’m really, really not.",,,,,,Rachel
 All right.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! I don’t think you’re going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it’s a girl, Rain.",,,,,,Rachel
 Why?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, why do you hate our child?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, James.",,,,,,Rachel
 But only if it’s a girl.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! I’m sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?,,,,,,Rachel
 Veto. Sawyer?,,,,,,Rachel
 Veto.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!",,,,,,Rachel
 But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it’s a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?,,,,,,Rachel
 Right. Right.,,,,,,Rachel
" (looking at the bulletin board with baby pictures) So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?",,,,,,Rachel
 Third one from the left?,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 I didn’t!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay fine, I did. But I didn’t see anything, I swear.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, but Ross just listen to me…",,,,,,Rachel
" But I couldn’t even if I wanted to, because I don’t know! I swear; I didn’t see anything, and I don’t want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.",,,,,,Rachel
" (holding stomach) Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
 You know what? I’ve been thinking about it. I’m really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.,,,,,,Rachel
 I didn’t see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.,,,,,,Rachel
 I would—Sequoia?,,,,,,Rachel
 Fine.,,,,,,Rachel
" But Ross, you want the name Ruth!",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, I swear, I don’t know.",,,,,,Rachel
 A what?!,,,,,,Rachel
 We’re having a girl?,,,,,,Rachel
 That’s what you just said!,,,,,,Rachel
 You said girl!,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m not! We’re having a girl! Sometimes I can’t believe it’s with you—But still! We’re having a girl!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yes! We’ll have ourselves a little baby Ruth…",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, please.",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? (Looks at Chandler) Oh, my! (Covers the spot where Joey wants bubbles to be replaced.)",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I was waiting for you!",,,,,,Rachel
 We’re having a girl.,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Hi, sweetie.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Joey, Iâ€™m so happy things worked out for us that weâ€™re having this baby together. I love you so much.",,,,,,Rachel
" And I hope itâ€™s not an inappropriate time to say this but, youâ€™re the best s*x I ever had.",,,,,,Rachel
 (bursts into the room) Joey! Joey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Come feel this! Come feel my belly!,,,,,,Rachel
 Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, okay! (She goes over to him and he feels her belly.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Aw, itâ€™s unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, sheâ€™s like ummâ€¦ohâ€¦whoâ€™s that kind of annoying girl soccer player?",,,,,,Rachel
 Mia Hamm!,,,,,,Rachel
 (looking down) Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!,,,,,,Rachel
 Itâ€™s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do (Mimics him) that again.,,,,,,Rachel
 Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joeyâ€™s room and he was sleepingâ€¦,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I donâ€™tâ€”Whoa!! (Winces in pain.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. Oh Godâ€”Ow!â€”Oo!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it youâ€™ve had one of these Braxton thingies?",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you doctor. (Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey) Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.,,,,,,Rachel
 But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 But Iâ€”But everything is okay. Iâ€™m fine!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctorâ€™s uterus though. Mild discomfort, whatâ€™s he talking about?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, everythingâ€™s fine!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, no uterus, no opinion.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh you went to the movies by yourself?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I gotta go back in there.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, everythingâ€™s fine. I just gotta go backâ€¦",,,,,,Rachel
 I-I forgot my underwear. (Ross lets her go.),,,,,,Rachel
 Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! Thatâ€™s so sweet of you! Oh yum! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich and starts to get sick.) Did you put pickles on this?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh Ross!! (Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.),,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, Iâ€™ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.",,,,,,Rachel
 Whatâ€™s up?,,,,,,Rachel
 (Gasps) Are you breaking up with us?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
 Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?,,,,,,Rachel
" But Joey, I donâ€™t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I meanâ€”(Ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)â€”Or he does.",,,,,,Rachel
" But Ross, its you and me!",,,,,,Rachel
 I donâ€™t know. Is it crazy?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, letâ€™s do it. Iâ€™ll move in.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine’s Day!",,,,,,Rachel
" It’s good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages? (to the waitress handing her a cup of coffee) Oh, thank you. I’ll see you guys later.",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
 I accidentally packed these with my stuff. (looks at the dog and gasps) Who is this?,,,,,,Rachel
" (talking with a higher voice, and puckered lips…kind of like you do to a baby or...well…a puppy…it’s hard to explain. Just use your imagination!) Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I’ve got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. (still talking like that) Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can’t stop it. (exits)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I’ve got big Valentine’s plans! I’ve got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! (runs to her room to get her money),,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Oh, hey, Mona!",,,,,,Rachel
 I’ll be watching TV if anybody needs me. (exits to her room),,,,,,Rachel
 I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!,,,,,,Rachel
" You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed! (exits)",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) I’m just going to grab the phone.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I’m sorry! Do you need the phone?",,,,,,Rachel
" (as Ross enters with a present) But, but, Mona, I live here.",,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) Hi! I’m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine’s, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
 Why? You saw it? Is it scary?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, now, wait. Now I’m all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.",,,,,,Rachel
" C’mon, seriously, you guys, you’re not going to make me watch this alone!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. (watching the tape) Ooh, my! (Rachel jumps when the woman starts screaming) Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Uh! It’s horrible!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, my God!",,,,,,Rachel
 What? Did her ass explode?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, screw you guys, you don’t have to do it!",,,,,,Rachel
" (thinking) You’re going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, you’re going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it! (Rachel puts the tape in the VCR)",,,,,,Rachel
 (thinking) Hmm…maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh-oh! Okay, she’s kicking!",,,,,,Rachel
 Whoa!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow that was a big one.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.,,,,,,Rachel
" (To Phoebe) Well, what’s he like?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Of course, of course.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh sure. Older?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I was just gonna ask!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.",,,,,,Rachel
 Joey? What’s up?,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay what’s up?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well honey, I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?",,,,,,Rachel
 Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay? (Walks away.),,,,,,Rachel
 …and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him. (Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?,,,,,,Rachel
" No. Not-not for me, but why don’t you take off your sweater?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?,,,,,,Rachel
" Huh. Wow, I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much.",,,,,,Rachel
" Um, seven…e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 So you were saying?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, ""Eight years."" And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm…now here we are.",,,,,,Rachel
 (stunned) What?,,,,,,Rachel
" (looking around) Who are you talking too? Oh, you’re kidding! Oh, it’s a joke! (Laughs.) It’s funny. It’s funny. I don’t get it. (Joey doesn’t say any thing and Rachel realizes it’s not a joke.) Oh. (Pause) Okay. Umm… I-I…uh, wow. Are you uh… How did umm… When?",,,,,,Rachel
" Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I…",,,,,,Rachel
 Joey.,,,,,,Rachel
" No! Joey please! Please don’t! Please don’t leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (Starts to cry.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Can I? (Hug him.),,,,,,Rachel
 Oh Joey honey I don’t…I don’t want to lose…,,,,,,Rachel
 I’m so sorry.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, that was a real good one.",,,,,,Rachel
 Joey? Are you in there?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 Is Joey here?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, at least you make each other laugh.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I haven’t seen him since that night that he told me how he y’know… I don’t know, I think he’s avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?",,,,,,Rachel
" All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh…tell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, I’m done. Do mine.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well just ask Mona to give it back!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it’s not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.",,,,,,Rachel
" How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah. That makes sense.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, I can do that.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah it’s umm… Yeah it’s uh… It-it’s y’know—It’s nothing.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah—No wait! Joey no wait it is. It’s something. It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, and umm my baby.",,,,,,Rachel
 My boss wants to buy my baby!,,,,,,Rachel
" I know I told you, it’s a really big problem.",,,,,,Rachel
 Can you believe that?!,,,,,,Rachel
 That’s what I told him!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well I’ll tell ya! (Pause) See uh my-my boss and his wife—They-they can’t have children. So umm, and that—we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, ""Rachel, I want to buy your baby.""",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh! Yeah! (Pause) Yeah that-that would’ve been a much simpler problem.,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I think everything’s gonna be okay.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.",,,,,,Rachel
 (worried) What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Whoa-whoa-whoa, let’s say more!",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn’t want to buy my baby! I made that up!",,,,,,Rachel
 So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn’t be awkward!,,,,,,Rachel
 (To Joey) I can’t believe that you yelled at my boss! I’m-I’m gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Joey, I can’t believe you brought my boss into this! I’m gonna get fired!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, she told me too! (Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Morning. You wanted to see me?,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay look Mr. Zelner…,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. (Motions for him to continue.),,,,,,Rachel
 Oh God.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, as long as we are clear about that. (Exits smugly.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
 It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’m not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.,,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, can you give us a minute?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, I’m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things…",,,,,,Rachel
" It kinda worked. I mean y’know, I don’t know about you buy I haven’t thought about our thing since all this.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah I know! I miss that.,,,,,,Rachel
 My gynecologist tried to kill me.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?",,,,,,Rachel
" I, uh, think you already are.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, otherwise I’m not going.",,,,,,Rachel
" This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hmmm….,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you…we’re so excited,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, if you’re going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I know I don’t either, but ya know what, it’s their party, and it’s just one night. And we don’t even have to lie; we just won’t say anything. If it comes up again, we’ll just…smile. We’ll nod along.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh…,,,,,,Rachel
 (looking at the check) Unbelievable!,,,,,,Rachel
 Open it! Open it! Open it!,,,,,,Rachel
" But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.",,,,,,Rachel
" On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn’t She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, Stevie’s an old family friend. (Hits Ross’s chest)",,,,,,Rachel
 So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.,,,,,,Rachel
 What? I’m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.",,,,,,Rachel
" And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I don’t know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah. That’s a great story.,,,,,,Rachel
 Shhh! I want to hear the rest!,,,,,,Rachel
" And the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, it just wouldn’t have been feasible.",,,,,,Rachel
 It was really fun being married to you tonight.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?",,,,,,Rachel
" That proposal, at the planetarium…",,,,,,Rachel
" Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was…really wonderful! Did you just make that up?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, that would’ve been very hard to say no too.",,,,,,Rachel
 Goodnight,,,,,,Rachel
 I will think about it.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" So, I’m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. (She hands the magazine to Joey.)",,,,,,Rachel
 So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, don’t listen to him. Please?",,,,,,Rachel
" Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! I’m gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. (Looks at Joey.) Seriously, proud of you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, I’d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.",,,,,,Rachel
 That is the Coast Guard.,,,,,,Rachel
" It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, come on now!",,,,,,Rachel
" (interrupting him) Hi! I’m gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want the dirt, I’m the one you come too. This might be Joey’s baby (rubbing her stomach), who knows? I’m just kidding—Seriously, (leans into the cassette recorder Shelley is using) gal pal Rachel Green.",,,,,,Rachel
" (scoffs at him) Yeah, that’s gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well I…(leans into the microphone again)…I would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.",,,,,,Rachel
 You too!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Joey! Sorry!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
 I’ve never lived like this before.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, Jill!",,,,,,Rachel
 This is Chandler. (Points at him.),,,,,,Rachel
 And you know Monica and Ross!,,,,,,Rachel
" And that’s Phoebe (points), and that’s Joey.",,,,,,Rachel
 Don’t!! (Joey backs away frightened.),,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where you said you didn’t watch soap operas.,,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 So what’s the final head count on my baby shower?,,,,,,Rachel
" What?! You mean they’re not coming to a social event where there’s no men and there’s no booze?! That’s shocking! I don’t care, as long as my mom’s here.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?! My mom’s not gonna be here?!,,,,,,Rachel
 My God!,,,,,,Rachel
 So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Please, make sure she comes. It’s really important to me, I mean it’s my mom!",,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t know.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. (Mrs. Green helps her up and they walk over and get some tea.),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don’t even have a housekeeper.",,,,,,Rachel
" Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca. (I think that’s your mother’s crazy.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, however great she was I just can’t afford that.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Wh-wh-what? What?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes. Yes I do.,,,,,,Rachel
 Why did you invite my mother?!,,,,,,Rachel
 She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.,,,,,,Rachel
" Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.",,,,,,Rachel
" What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?",,,,,,Rachel
" You’re right. You’re right. I mean I’m about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don’t want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She’s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. (She goes over to tell her mother.),,,,,,Rachel
 Mom that’s okay that you didn’t get you a gift!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.",,,,,,Rachel
" But mom, I really know what I’m doing. I can handle this.",,,,,,Rachel
 He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!,,,,,,Rachel
 Wow!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! (She’s holding an item with a large suction cup connected to a yellow plastic box, with a long narrow tube and bottle connected the yellow part.) Wait a minute. That can’t be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?",,,,,,Rachel
" Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What’s this?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well that’s gross, why don’t you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?",,,,,,Rachel
 What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!,,,,,,Rachel
" I don’t know, I’d leave it on the changing table? (Everyone gasps.) What?! What’d I do? What’d I do?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh come—(Stutters)—Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would—she wouldn’t be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y’know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I’m just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay mommy, don’t ever leave me. (Hugs her.)",,,,,,Rachel
" So umm, you’re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh mom, I swear I’m not an idiot. I’ve read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby’s coming and I don’t know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?",,,,,,Rachel
 Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.",,,,,,Rachel
 No. She’s going to live with us for eight weeks.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes! She’s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. (Sees that Ross isn’t happy.),,,,,,Rachel
 I do. I really do. I don’t know anything.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hello?! I still don’t know what the hell I’m doing!,,,,,,Rachel
 I hope you’re going somewhere with this.,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you. (Hugs him.),,,,,,Rachel
 (closing a book) Okay! I’m ready.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, I’ve done my studying and I really know my stuff.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, put your elbow in it.",,,,,,Rachel
" Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.",,,,,,Rachel
" Check if it’s wet, check if it’s hungry, burp it!",,,,,,Rachel
 A card! A card! I pick a card!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah but y’know what they say Mon, ""There’s no such thing as bad press.""",,,,,,Rachel
 I didn’t write it.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ross!,,,,,,Rachel
 I am freaking out!,,,,,,Rachel
 My due date is in one week!,,,,,,Rachel
 That is seven days!,,,,,,Rachel
" (interrupting him) No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m serious.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. Thank you. That’s great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there’s this really cute shoe store that has like this little…,,,,,,Rachel
" (stopping him) Oh, wait Ross! I’m sorry, one more thing!",,,,,,Rachel
" Umm, our situation. Y’know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we’re having this baby together, and we live together. Isn’t that, isn’t that weird?",,,,,,Rachel
 I’m just kidding! You can go pee! (He does so in a hurry.),,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" No-no-no! No, no, no, we’re not married.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah! Actually, that’s one of the reasons why we’re not a couple.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. Oh yeah, don’t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he’s a doctor, but he’s not.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God! I’m standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I’m bored.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi Pheebs!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost got something that wasn’t on the list. A whore.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 You don’t understand! You didn’t see how brazen she was.,,,,,,Rachel
 No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’s that I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl at Sluts ‘R’ Us!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah! You really—You look great.,,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, I’m not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you. (Gets up and hurries out.)",,,,,,Rachel
" All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?",,,,,,Rachel
" Horny bitch. (They both look at her, pretending that the dinosaurs she’s holding are arguing.) No! You’re a horny bitch! Noooo! You’re the horny bitch! No! You’re a horny bitch!",,,,,,Rachel
" So you guys go, have a really good time.",,,,,,Rachel
" So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you missed a button.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh okay, I see what you’re doing there.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi! You’re back from your date!,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m fine, but that’s not important. What’s important is how was she?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.",,,,,,Rachel
" No! No, she’s—She was nice. I mean, she’s a little slutty, but who isn’t?",,,,,,Rachel
" Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!",,,,,,Rachel
" No! It’s just that, Kate bothered me.",,,,,,Rachel
 There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!,,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t want you to date her!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don’t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it’s a terrible thing to even think this, and it’s completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I’m very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Really? But I’m being so unreasonable.,,,,,,Rachel
" (starting to cry) Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. (They hug.)",,,,,,Rachel
" No, not really. You’re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry. (She gets up and starts for the bathroom.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. (Stops and starts doing the I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.),,,,,,Rachel
 Uh-huh.,,,,,,Rachel
" (pause) Wow! I don’t know, maybe. I’m…",,,,,,Rachel
 (laughs) I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin’ with you too!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no-no-no-no, no!",,,,,,Rachel
 No that’s just—(Laughs)—That’s just ‘cause I’m such a good messer!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
 Right! (Heads for the bathroom.),,,,,,Rachel
" Well obviously I won’t be able to come, for those of you who haven’t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y’know, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you’ve been during this time. I really couldn’t have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant.",,,,,,Rachel
" That’s right, still no baby! (To Monica, Joey, and Chandler on the couch) Come on people! Please make some room!",,,,,,Rachel
 You. Like you haven’t done enough.,,,,,,Rachel
 God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!,,,,,,Rachel
" (interrupting her) Oh Phoebe, that’s a great story. Can you tell it to me when you’re getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (To the baby) Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!",,,,,,Rachel
 Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘Cause I’ll do it.,,,,,,Rachel
" They sent me home from work. They were like, ""Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby."" Well y’know what? Screw ‘em! If they don’t want me there, I’ll just hang out with you guys.",,,,,,Rachel
 (overhearing that) What-what about me?,,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I’m pregnant you think I’m invisible.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I have to pee. If I don’t come out in five minutes it’s because I’ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)",,,,,,Rachel
" (calling from the bathroom) All right, who’s turn is it to help me get up!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)",,,,,,Rachel
 In a minute!!!,,,,,,Rachel
" (entering) All right, all right. Let’s go!",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I’m fine.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh uh-uh pal! Don’t call me mommy! It’s bad enough you call your own mother that. (He looks at Monica.),,,,,,Rachel
 Ross.,,,,,,Rachel
 Can I ask you something?,,,,,,Rachel
 When Carol was pregnant with Ben…,,,,,,Rachel
 …were you this irritating?,,,,,,Rachel
 Excuse me?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.,,,,,,Rachel
" (silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That’s great!",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi Dr. Long, how are you?",,,,,,Rachel
 She has the drugs!,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. (Rachel lies back.),,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Eh, just a tad.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, we are ready to try anything.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Great! We will do all of those.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, there is one thing that we haven’t tried, but someone thinks that, (mimicking Ross) ""That will open up a can of worms.""",,,,,,Rachel
 Why? Why today?,,,,,,Rachel
 I’ll take that bet.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I’m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh honey, don’t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow’s the day.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ross I—We tried all the spicy food. It’s not working.,,,,,,Rachel
" I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have s*x with you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what’s gonna work! It’s doctor recommended!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh come on Ross, we’ve done it before we’ll do it again, it’ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.",,,,,,Rachel
 Make love? What are you a girl?,,,,,,Rachel
" But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I know it. You’re right. That’s not sexy. Oh…Oh! (Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it. (Tries too, but can’t quite seem to make it.) Oh God!",,,,,,Rachel
" Come on Ross! I’m miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh wow! What now Ross you’re not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean you’d think the damn jalepeno would’ve cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That’s not enough… (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?!",,,,,,Rachel
 (breaking the kiss) Oh God!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" I didn’t uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to…",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" (deadpan) Yes, the hard part is truly over.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi! (Ross is stunned.),,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, you stay here and talk, I’m gonna go have a baby.",,,,,,Rachel
" (interrupting her) Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I’m sorry, semi-private? We (Laughs), we asked for a private room.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! (They walk away from the desk.),,,,,,Rachel
 Give her some money.,,,,,,Rachel
" They’re not!! Ross, they’re just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!",,,,,,Rachel
 (standing up) Okay. Y’know what? I’d have to say I really don’t care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to—Whoa! (She starts a contraction) Oh gosh! Whoa!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ow! Ow! Contraction. (Sits back down.) Ow-ow! Ow-ow! (Starts breathing heavily.),,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, it couldn’t hurt to look.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, okay.",,,,,,Rachel
" Thank you. (Dr. Long exits.) Well, I guess we have some time to kill.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah well it looks great!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 How are you?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah it is.,,,,,,Rachel
 That’s so sweet.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, I really don’t want any—(He takes the picture)—Oh! Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross…",,,,,,Rachel
 Here comes another contraction.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that’s very—Really very-very okay.",,,,,,Rachel
" (simultaneously as Ross) No, I don’t think we’ll be doing that.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh. Oh wait no.,,,,,,Rachel
 No-no-don’t! Don’t leave me here with these people.,,,,,,Rachel
 No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!",,,,,,Rachel
 New people.,,,,,,Rachel
 They’re having their baby! It’s not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick b*st*rd. Oh God oh! Contraction!",,,,,,Rachel
 Ooh! Ow!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ross.,,,,,,Rachel
 He’s looking at me.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn’t need to be; she’ll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction! (Leans back on Ross for some support.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah it was.,,,,,,Rachel
" Dr. Long, I’ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, y’know what? I’m not waiting! I’m gonna push this baby out! I’m doing it! I mean it’s what? Three centimeters? That’s gotta be like this! (Holds her hands a couple inches apart.)",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh stupid metric system!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh for the love of God!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh come on!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, that’s four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I’m next! It’s my turn! It’s only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to sue you! Not this hospital, I’m going to sue you! And my husband (Points at Ross) he’s a lawyer!",,,,,,Rachel
 Go get back on that case honey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, well then bring her in.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
 I get it!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh we-we didn’t.,,,,,,Rachel
 Just tell me how.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh hi.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! (Starts another contraction as Dr. Long enters.),,,,,,Rachel
 Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 My God. Okay. (Another woman enters.) Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!,,,,,,Rachel
 3-2-1 oh!!,,,,,,Rachel
" I can’t. I can’t push anymore, I can’t.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!,,,,,,Rachel
" Don’t say, ""Oh my God!"" Oh my God what?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m sorry, I can’t!",,,,,,Rachel
 I can’t!,,,,,,Rachel
" I can’t. Please, you do it for me.",,,,,,Rachel
 Are you okay?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh God!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, she’s so tiny. (Starts crying) Where’d she go?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Well be careful with her, she’s really tiny.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. (The baby cries.) I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she’s looking at me. Hi! I know you.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, not yet.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hello baby girl.,,,,,,Rachel
 Here. (Hands her to Monica.),,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh nothing I… Sorry, I just can’t stop crying.",,,,,,Rachel
 So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don’t see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God. (Starts to cry harder.),,,,,,Rachel
 I was reliving it.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, and y’know what? I love them both, so why don’t you just pick one and that’ll be it.",,,,,,Rachel
" That’s not her name! I’m sorry, she just doesn’t feel like an Isabella.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well what are we going to do?,,,,,,Rachel
 Well tell us! What are they?,,,,,,Rachel
 And if it’s a girl?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, just tell us! We’re not gonna want it!",,,,,,Rachel
 (gasps) Emma! (Looks at the baby and starts to cry.) See? I don’t want it.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh honey, but you love that name.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohhh! (Looks at Aaron and recoils in horror.) Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn’t he?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I’m fine. (Gasps in pain as she sits down.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well then he gets a divorce, it’s Ross!",,,,,,Rachel
 Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well… That’s…y’know—That’s—We’ve been alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay. Besides y’know what? I-I—Maybe we won’t be alone, ‘cause lately I-I—things have been happening between me and Ross, y’know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y’know? So it might be the…the beginning of something.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh-huh. (Ross takes off his coat and sets in on a chair.) Y’know what I was, I was thinking about?",,,,,,Rachel
 Umm…that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?,,,,,,Rachel
 (pause) Right.,,,,,,Rachel
" No! No, of course not. No. That’s why I brought it up. (Pause) They didn’t have any sodas?",,,,,,Rachel
 That’s all right. (He goes to get her a soda.) And so it begins.,,,,,,Rachel
 Nothing.,,,,,,Rachel
 Really it’s nothing. I’m just…,,,,,,Rachel
 I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh please, he’ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.",,,,,,Rachel
" I’m just saying that y’know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?",,,,,,Rachel
 I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?,,,,,,Rachel
 Joey. Honey what would I do without you?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They’re right on that chair under Ross’s coat.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Joey.,,,,,,Rachel
 (seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Joey.,,,,,,Rachel
 (seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 So uh…I guess we should…make it official huh?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey you.,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I still need to talk to you.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
 Uhh… I think I just got engaged.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?,,,,,,Rachel
 And you really think this is a good idea?,,,,,,Rachel
 I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?! Even Ross?,,,,,,Rachel
 I guess so.,,,,,,Rachel
 I can’t say that I’m surprised.,,,,,,Rachel
" Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my breast?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.",,,,,,Rachel
" I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh look, she’s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesn’t she look scared?",,,,,,Rachel
 It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey. I need to tell you something.,,,,,,Rachel
 Joey asked me marry him.,,,,,,Rachel
 Joey proposed to me.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I-I said yes.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.",,,,,,Rachel
 Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.,,,,,,Rachel
 Sure.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I mean whatever.",,,,,,Rachel
" No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
 Surprised?,,,,,,Rachel
 I know.,,,,,,Rachel
 You didn’t propose to me. Joey did.,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh… You didn’t propose to me, Chandler didn’t propose to me, but Joey did.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes you did!,,,,,,Rachel
 Well then why did you give me a ring?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, you did!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, you did!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, you did! And don’t you say, ""No, I didn’t!""",,,,,,Rachel
 He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, what did happen?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, but you said, ""Will you marry me?""",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, you did!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, you did—Oh my God you didn’t! (Screams) Well then why didn’t you tell me that before?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!",,,,,,Rachel
 You were gonna propose to me?,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
" She’s doing it Look, she’s breast-feeding look!",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh wow, this feels weird.",,,,,,Rachel
 Wonderful weird.,,,,,,Rachel
" Honey don’t worry, it was my mistake.",,,,,,Rachel
 She’s perfect.,,,,,,Rachel
 We really are.,,,,,,Rachel
 I know. I know. I’ve feeling…,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. (Laughs nervously),,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, maybe.",,,,,,Rachel
 Wh-what’s that?,,,,,,Rachel
" I’m sorry, what?",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! (Pause) I’m not helping.",,,,,,Rachel
 That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well—Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ooooo!,,,,,,Rachel
 (enters with Emma) Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh you guys thanks for doing this.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Ah! (Sees a big stuffed gorilla) Oh my gosh there’s something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are people think… (Reads the card) Oh you guys I love it.",,,,,,Rachel
 He’s downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you more then me, but he can’t stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I’m not so sure you should be here when he comes up.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh great, the pacifiers?",,,,,,Rachel
 The burping clogs?,,,,,,Rachel
 The diapers?,,,,,,Rachel
" Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?",,,,,,Rachel
" Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...",,,,,,Rachel
 Blueberry.,,,,,,Rachel
 Thanks.,,,,,,Rachel
 God how long do you think that’s gonna last?,,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know I can’t even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can’t believe how much I love her, I can’t get enough of her, like right now I miss her. I actually miss her.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh god look at her sleeping. Oh, I love her so much! Oh, I think I’m gonna wake her up.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well I can do whatever I want! I made her! (Waking Emma up.) Come on little girl, hi!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh I’m sorry mummy’s so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep. Shh. Shhh! Go back to sleep,,,,,,Rachel
 Ok. (Starts swinging Emma rapidly and she stops crying),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh (happy) oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. (Emma starts crying again.) Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won’t stop crying.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I’m not so sure.",,,,,,Rachel
 I already fed her.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I’m gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! How long has she been crying?,,,,,,Rachel
" You guys, I’m doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.",,,,,,Rachel
 Here you go. (Hands Emma to Phoebe),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can’t even comfort my own baby! I’m the worst mother ever!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah I don’t think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.,,,,,,Rachel
 I have to go to the bathroom. (Goes to the bathroom),,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!,,,,,,Rachel
 You are the official baby crier stopper!,,,,,,Rachel
 You’re never leaving the apartment!,,,,,,Rachel
" That’s your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you here.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay so listen I’m gonna go lay down.,,,,,,Rachel
 You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be sleeping so… (She gives Monica thumbs and goes to lay down),,,,,,Rachel
" Heeeeey, where have you been? (He shows her his thumb) What happened to you?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit. (He sits) You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?",,,,,,Rachel
 You know what I really really want?,,,,,,Rachel
" I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.",,,,,,Rachel
" I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? Not easy.",,,,,,Rachel
 No its really okay… Monica!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 What?!,,,,,,Rachel
 (To Monica) Do you have to go?,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.,,,,,,Rachel
 Every time? (She takes up her cell phone and starts dialing.),,,,,,Rachel
" All right, I trust you. (Continues to dial)",,,,,,Rachel
 I'm on the phone! (On the phone) Dr. Wiener? (Ross and Rachel walk away),,,,,,Rachel
" (On the phone) Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too! (Hangs up)",,,,,,Rachel
 Dr. Wiener.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hiccups.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?",,,,,,Rachel
 Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!,,,,,,Rachel
" What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.",,,,,,Rachel
" (Grabs the phone and stars dialing) (On phone) (In a high pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener (In a low pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener!!!",,,,,,Rachel
 Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!,,,,,,Rachel
" It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their pen1s against your knee?",,,,,,Rachel
" We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ross said he died.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.",,,,,,Rachel
 Why? What was it?,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it was really, really, really good.",,,,,,Rachel
 I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! (To Ross) I don't care!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've got a baby over here.",,,,,,Rachel
 Bye honey. (They hug),,,,,,Rachel
 Hello,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know guys do that.,,,,,,Rachel
 Nooooooooo!,,,,,,Rachel
 well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing?,,,,,,Rachel
 man sharks. I always knew there was something weird about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ah! You know what honey guys are just different, they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice.",,,,,,Rachel
 yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.,,,,,,Rachel
 (sits down) Hi,,,,,,Rachel
 so basically you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're just going around again.,,,,,,Rachel
" what, how do we know, we never slept with you.",,,,,,Rachel
" yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other.",,,,,,Rachel
" Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. (to Ross:) Which one of us should go to dinner?",,,,,,Rachel
" Um, Mon, Chandler's not here.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, let's see. The first one is: I don't want to. And, you know, I'm not going.",,,,,,Rachel
 She is?,,,,,,Rachel
 What about (?) Monica.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ish. I just don't think I can bear it.,,,,,,Rachel
 Uch.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh-A.,,,,,,Rachel
 You need to learn some new slang.,,,,,,Rachel
 What ... Oh! (points inside),,,,,,Rachel
 I was just going to say that I left my keys.,,,,,,Rachel
 No. Uch.,,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to do something--knock that door down!",,,,,,Rachel
 What if she jumped out the basinet?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my god, I left the water running.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ah, did I leave the stove on?",,,,,,Rachel
" Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ubb.,,,,,,Rachel
" Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true.",,,,,,Rachel
" Och, god. (seeing Emma) Oh, thank god, you're okay. I'm so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Uch.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again.",,,,,,Rachel
" We got locked out of the apartment, we ...",,,,,,Rachel
" N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I'm not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!",,,,,,Rachel
" She spit up. Judy! She spi...Judy! Look alive, Judy! (they sit down) Thank you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon.",,,,,,Rachel
 Y'guys ever heard the story about when Ross's mom went to the beauty salon?,,,,,,Rachel
" (lifts for a toast) Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ... to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.",,,,,,Rachel
" N-no, Emma dropped her sock.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground.",,,,,,Rachel
 (to Ross) Could you please get her attention?,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?",,,,,,Rachel
" So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.",,,,,,Rachel
" That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?",,,,,,Rachel
 Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... (they're standing up and make their way to the door),,,,,,Rachel
 Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.,,,,,,Rachel
 Okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face while Ross crumples up the application form) Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.,,,,,,Rachel
" (indignant) What, the blonde with no bra?",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay... (Ross opens the door.),,,,,,Rachel
" Sandy, that's exactly what it is...",,,,,,Rachel
 Ross!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that's pretty.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that would be great! (Sandy leaves for Emma's room) I love him, I love him, I love him...",,,,,,Rachel
" So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.",,,,,,Rachel
 Why?,,,,,,Rachel
" (she's got that ""yeah, try to say it"" look on her face) Yes?",,,,,,Rachel
" (whispering and begging) Please? (Ross makes a ""whatever"" gesture) YES! Sandy you're hired.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.,,,,,,Rachel
 (in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around and sees Ross) Hi...,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful.",,,,,,Rachel
 I can't... I can't hear it again.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! (to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen with Ross and sighs),,,,,,Rachel
" Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.",,,,,,Rachel
 What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?,,,,,,Rachel
 Sandy made Madeleines.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, what? What is too sensitive? (There's music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved by this, but Ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the kitchen, angrily. The door he was holding, swings back and hits Rachel.)",,,,,,Rachel
 That was kind of rude!,,,,,,Rachel
" You know, he was just doing his job...",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, come on Ross...",,,,,,Rachel
 (sighs) Oh... That's true.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it. (Ross walks to the living room determined to fire Sandy)",,,,,,Rachel
 I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. (Ross walks to the couch where Sandy sits),,,,,,Rachel
 (from behind the bedroom door) YOU! You feel!,,,,,,Rachel
" (from bedroom) Oh, damn you Geller!",,,,,,Rachel
 (from the bedroom) Huh ha ha!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, she can't be herself.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, he took the SAT's for me.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
 I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents.,,,,,,Rachel
 (in disbelief) You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a,,,,,,Rachel
" Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh? (excited)",,,,,,Rachel
 You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who,,,,,,Rachel
 (disgusted) owwwww...,,,,,,Rachel
 Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a",,,,,,Rachel
 Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...,,,,,,Rachel
 So fellas,,,,,,Rachel
 fellas,,,,,,Rachel

 So shake it! (Rachel slaps Ross's butt on the beat),,,,,,Rachel
" Shake it! (Phoebe, Mike, Chandler, Monica and Joey step in)",,,,,,Rachel
 Shake that nasty butt...,,,,,,Rachel
" One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you",,,,,,Rachel
 Who is it?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hide my rings.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh. <opens door preparing herself and then happily says>,,,,,,Rachel
 Um... hi.,,,,,,Rachel
 Aw.,,,,,,Rachel
 I haven't seen you in like.. a year.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your v*g1n*, <shakes head no> not the same thing.",,,,,,Rachel
 mh hmm..,,,,,,Rachel
 Uh.... its Emma.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Amy, you remember Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
 Amy! <pause> Yes I do.. I really do. <grabs Ross' hand for support>,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.",,,,,,Rachel
 God she is unbelievable.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.",,,,,,Rachel
 What? What happened?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Amy, don't cry Amy.  Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?",,,,,,Rachel
 Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.,,,,,,Rachel
" Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just going to have to make our peace with that!",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy.  This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh we just put her down for a nap.,,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby.",,,,,,Rachel
" See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.",,,,,,Rachel
 Monica is Ross' sister.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.,,,,,,Rachel
 Well actually...,,,,,,Rachel
" Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.",,,,,,Rachel
 UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy's>,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?,,,,,,Rachel
 What? What carrer?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.,,,,,,Rachel
 Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.,,,,,,Rachel
 I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.,,,,,,Rachel
 uh huh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?",,,,,,Rachel
 Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!,,,,,,Rachel
" I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.",,,,,,Rachel
 ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It's forty five.,,,,,,Rachel
 You take that back.,,,,,,Rachel
 Take it back!,,,,,,Rachel
" Heey man, I work out.",,,,,,Rachel
 I do pilates.,,,,,,Rachel
 Bring it on!,,,,,,Rachel
 Did you just push me?,,,,,,Rachel
 Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back>,,,,,,Rachel
 Ew! Gross.,,,,,,Rachel
" Mon, I'm so sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
 Are you okay Mon?,,,,,,Rachel
" Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..",,,,,,Rachel
 Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.,,,,,,Rachel
 She needs changing.,,,,,,Rachel
 I hope the ends of these sentences are good!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ahh. [Looks down] Well, thank you! Ha-ha! [Ross continues to stare at Rachel] Okay – stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened [pointing towards Ross’s crotch] that happened [pointing at Emma]",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! Phoebe and I are gonna have so much fun! Thank you for watching the baby, by the way.",,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe’s Mike?,,,,,,Rachel
 I didn’t know that you guys hung out.,,,,,,Rachel
 Awww. That’s so cute! Ross and Mike’s first date! [Beat] Is that going to be awkward? What are you guys gonna talk about?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, So now I think Emma is properly down for the night but if you need anything Ross…[pointing finger into his chest]",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay. You too. And I hope you score.,,,,,,Rachel
 Bye [to Mike],,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, god. It seems like forever ago.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, um, I don’t know. I mean, for a long time, nothing. You know, actually, right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a little thing.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, um, first he told me that he liked how I looked, and then, erm, we had a little, erm, eye contact.",,,,,,Rachel
 Uh huh.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, wait, don’t do that! It’s gonna make them think that they can come over here!",,,,,,Rachel
 We’re not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend. I have a…baby and a Ross.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my god! I can’t believe you live in that building! My grandmother lives in that building, Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kinda smells of chicken? Looks like a potato?!?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! That’s my muppy!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it’s complicated. I don’t actually have a boyfriend, but, erm…",,,,,,Rachel
" I’m sorry, no.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, sure!",,,,,,Rachel
 Great. [Gives thumbs up],,,,,,Rachel
 I don’t know. He was cute and he liked me. It was an impulse.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, no, ‘cos I know exactly how the conversation is going to go. “Hey Ross”, “You know, I think that we had a moment before” [As Ross] “Yeah, um, me too” [As herself] “Well, but I’m not sure I really wanna do anything about it!” [As Ross] “Yeah, um, me, um, neither.” [As herself] “Ross, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we’re really feeling?” [As Ross] “Yeah, that works for me, um, um.”",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" The point is: maybe I should stop waiting around, waiting for moments with Ross. I should just move on with my life.",,,,,,Rachel
" Dunno, do I have to decide right now?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my god! Ross!! Ross is gonna pick up the phone! Ah, I have to get my number back! Oh my god! He’s gone!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, give me. [Rachel takes the phone of Phoebe] Hi, Mike! Hi, listen, I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what. If you do this, ah, Phoebe will do anything you want. Seriously, I’m talking dirty stuff.",,,,,,Rachel
" So, what did you guys do?",,,,,,Rachel
" Have fun, Pheebs! See ya guys. [Phoebe and Mike leave]",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh shoot, I forgot to pay Phoebe for the drinks! [Goes outside into the hallway] Wait, wait. So, did he call? Did that guy call?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, around 8:30?",,,,,,Rachel
 Then again at 9?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah…,,,,,,Rachel
 Ahhh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it’s so much fun. It’s so good to be out.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back",,,,,,Rachel
 We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.,,,,,,Rachel
" Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a",,,,,,Rachel
 That's right!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it's a Macy's bag!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" (Reading from a tag that's attached to the shoe) ""Dear losers,",,,,,,Rachel
 Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.,,,,,,Rachel
" (interrupting him) Oh Chandler, stop talking!",,,,,,Rachel
" (opens her present from Ross; it's a dark-red scarf) Oohh, I",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, not (the|this) second!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh wow, it's so beautiful...",,,,,,Rachel
 What do you really want to do?,,,,,,Rachel
 Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, because if one more person says ""what a cute little boy"" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!",,,,,,Rachel
 That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.,,,,,,Rachel
 I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . (To the guy behind her desk) Who the hell are you!?,,,,,,Rachel
 I'm the hell person whose office this is!,,,,,,Rachel
 Excuse me?,,,,,,Rachel
" Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?",,,,,,Rachel
 A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.,,,,,,Rachel
" Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way",,,,,,Rachel
 Excuse me?,,,,,,Rachel
" Can you please, please take care of it for me?",,,,,,Rachel
 Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?,,,,,,Rachel
 That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?",,,,,,Rachel
 Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.",,,,,,Rachel
" That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?",,,,,,Rachel
" (To herself) Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.",,,,,,Rachel
 Today.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.",,,,,,Rachel
" Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.",,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?",,,,,,Rachel
" Come on, I don't know what else to do.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ross?,,,,,,Rachel
 You're pretty.,,,,,,Rachel
" Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, they were popular when I left!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just",,,,,,Rachel
 (Sits down in her chair) Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?,,,,,,Rachel
" Fine, I will. (Pushes that button thing on the chair that makes it ""collapse"") Alright, fill me in!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me",,,,,,Rachel
" Except that! (Mr. Zelner enters) Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.",,,,,,Rachel
" What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I can't, I have a baby.",,,,,,Rachel
 Why would you do that?,,,,,,Rachel
 That's really nice.,,,,,,Rachel
" Then you're not gonna like what's coming. (Starts crying) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.",,,,,,Rachel
" OK, thank you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, wow, Molly is just great!",,,,,,Rachel
 What? You really think she's hot?,,,,,,Rachel
 And Joey?,,,,,,Rachel
 Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you! (goes to get coffee),,,,,,Rachel
 So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. (Joey and Chandler clap their hands),,,,,,Rachel
 Hello.,,,,,,Rachel
" Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.",,,,,,Rachel
 I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, I'm jealous. ""Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass"". (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.",,,,,,Rachel
" That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.",,,,,,Rachel
" It was ... (can't remember) oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just ""Tag"". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?",,,,,,Rachel
" (to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.",,,,,,Rachel
" Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.",,,,,,Rachel
" Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! (takes the phone) Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son (gives phone to Gavin)",,,,,,Rachel
" Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.",,,,,,Rachel
 If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you ""momma's boy"", starting right now.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.",,,,,,Rachel
 Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!,,,,,,Rachel
 I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!",,,,,,Rachel
 Shh!,,,,,,Rachel
" (to Monica) I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.",,,,,,Rachel
" God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, ok, thank you. (Molly leaves) (to Monica) Do you see what all the guys see in her?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, sure!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws away the box, she and Mon jump up the sofa)",,,,,,Rachel
" Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?",,,,,,Rachel
 Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?,,,,,,Rachel
" whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.",,,,,,Rachel
 Mmm hmm.,,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at (looks at his watch) ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you bought me a present! Why?",,,,,,Rachel
" Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card (opens the card). ""From Gavin""",,,,,,Rachel
" (opens the present, it's a green scarf) Awww, awww, it's beautiful.",,,,,,Rachel
" See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?",,,,,,Rachel
 Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.,,,,,,Rachel
 You do?,,,,,,Rachel
" See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.,,,,,,Rachel
 No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...",,,,,,Rachel
" You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...",,,,,,Rachel
" You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!",,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't",,,,,,Rachel
 Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...,,,,,,Rachel
 Who is it?,,,,,,Rachel
 Why?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin",,,,,,Rachel
" I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh no no no,,,,,,Rachel
 So did I,,,,,,Rachel
 It's just a cold,,,,,,Rachel
 What? What's the matter?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really.",,,,,,Rachel
 I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.,,,,,,Rachel
" Right, right, yes!",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.,,,,,,Rachel
 OK.,,,,,,Rachel
 I thought it was Ross.,,,,,,Rachel
 There isn't. There is totally isn't.,,,,,,Rachel
" All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes,,,,,,Rachel
 People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin,,,,,,Rachel
 So seriously...rodeo clown?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I’ve been looking for you everywhere!",,,,,,Rachel
" Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o’ clock. So I was hoping you and I could have a",,,,,,Rachel
 Who?,,,,,,Rachel
 You’ve being seeing someone?,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi, and I am also Emma’s mother.",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow. She does that a lot!,,,,,,Rachel
" What, what, wait a minute! You haven’t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, Ross, what’s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?",,,,,,Rachel
 How do you know about that?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that’s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?",,,,,,Rachel
 Score.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God, I can’t believe you’re making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 What? Who?,,,,,,Rachel
" Whoa, how do you know about that?",,,,,,Rachel
 Why didn’t I get that message?,,,,,,Rachel
" From the guy in the bar, why didn’t I get that message?",,,,,,Rachel
 Ross?,,,,,,Rachel
 Why?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What’s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they",,,,,,Rachel
" And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...",,,,,,Rachel
 Bye!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?",,,,,,Rachel
 I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, Phoebe set me up on a date. ",,,,,,Rachel
 Why? What's the big deal?,,,,,,Rachel
" What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.",,,,,,Rachel
 So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!",,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.",,,,,,Rachel
 Really? What's that like?,,,,,,Rachel
 Really? ,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!",,,,,,Rachel
 This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?,,,,,,Rachel
 I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!,,,,,,Rachel
 He's not stoned.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, four times.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.",,,,,,Rachel
 Don't touch my coat!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!",,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
" What? What do you mean, ""there you are""? Where was she?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, uh...",,,,,,Rachel
" Really, really not.",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.",,,,,,Rachel
 I just had a rough night.,,,,,,Rachel
 Eww!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called. ,,,,,,Rachel
 (enthusiastic) You got it!,,,,,,Rachel
 Your agent called. You got that audition.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it…",,,,,,Rachel
 (disbelieving) You saw that?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials. ",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, anything yet?",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, that was formula.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph. ",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi you guys!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.",,,,,,Rachel
 No. I was just going to do this myself. (Joey makes a sarcastic laugh.),,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?",,,,,,Rachel
 Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?,,,,,,Rachel
 Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!,,,,,,Rachel
 There is a hardware store right down the street?,,,,,,Rachel
 This is easy...Can't do this! (Moves away...and finds her sweater sleeve stuck to the drawer) Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this. (Fiddles more),,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh thank you so much. (Picks up the guy's spirit level) Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game. (hands it to him),,,,,,Rachel
 Don't look at me I never get his jokes.,,,,,,Rachel
 Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.,,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?",,,,,,Rachel
 No you really think that's what it is?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control. (she starts sobbing) God! It's just such a magical time!",,,,,,Rachel
 Argh. fascist,,,,,,Rachel
" Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?",,,,,,Rachel
 Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. (She suddenly lets go) I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.",,,,,,Rachel
 I'm so sorry Pheebs.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! How was basketball?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, no! Who did that?",,,,,,Rachel
" She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!",,,,,,Rachel
" All right... Oh, Emma loves him!",,,,,,Rachel
" (threatening Joey with a scrunchy): Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!",,,,,,Rachel
 What are you doing?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...",,,,,,Rachel
 Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, come on!",,,,,,Rachel
" I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?",,,,,,Rachel
 Original.,,,,,,Rachel
 Then what's that big lump under your covers?,,,,,,Rachel
 That's not Monica!,,,,,,Rachel
 (to herself) Oh God.,,,,,,Rachel
" (yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever (She leaves the room).",,,,,,Rachel
" Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma, look who's baaack!",,,,,,Rachel
 Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.",,,,,,Rachel
 Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.,,,,,,Rachel
 Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!,,,,,,Rachel
 She dropped off a casserole?,,,,,,Rachel
 (to Monica)What's going on?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, there's two spots left right?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.",,,,,,Rachel
" You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like ""oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape"" and you're gonna be all like ""oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai""",,,,,,Rachel
 I don't really care about the Knicks.,,,,,,Rachel
 (touched) You would do that? I never get picked!,,,,,,Rachel
 I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, I have another idea!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your ""special"" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?",,,,,,Rachel
" Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!",,,,,,Rachel
" (surprised) OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up! (she tries to snatch the bowl from Joey's hands but she can't, so she pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, she was just much better at job than me!",,,,,,Rachel
 (To Ross) You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi mum, put her back on!",,,,,,Rachel
" (on the phone) Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?",,,,,,Rachel
" (she goes towards the others and she's very excited) Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!",,,,,,Rachel
" She said ""gleba""!! (she celebrates)",,,,,,Rachel
 (to Ross) Isn't that amazing?,,,,,,Rachel
 Why-why aren't you more excited?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, but of course it is!",,,,,,Rachel
 I don't know all the words.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok... ""Emma just said gleba""!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up (she goes and picks up the dictionary).",,,,,,Rachel
" (searching the dictionary) Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... (excited) Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.",,,,,,Rachel
 You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?",,,,,,Rachel
 Me too.,,,,,,Rachel
" I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a canelope might hurt less.",,,,,,Rachel
 Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!,,,,,,Rachel
 (excited) Are you serious?,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, that was an honest mistake!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, that was an awesome day!",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, in my head he's done some pretty ""not-gay-stuff""!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck! (they hug)",,,,,,Rachel
" (watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) OH!",,,,,,Rachel
 SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!,,,,,,Rachel
" NO! (pause) Or, cut!You know, that's your call!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!",,,,,,Rachel
" God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!",,,,,,Rachel
" Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh screw her, that part is mine!",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. (pause).(acting) Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.",,,,,,Rachel
 (pause) Kiss me.,,,,,,Rachel
 Kiss me.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, I'm saying...",,,,,,Rachel
 just... don't talk... (she kisses him),,,,,,Rachel
" (waking up) Ehhh, aw! (pause). Well, that's new!",,,,,,Rachel
 Can I ask you a question?,,,,,,Rachel
 Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.",,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.",,,,,,Rachel
 Olivia.,,,,,,Rachel
 So do you think that my dream means anything?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...,,,,,,Rachel
 You took the same class twice.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, we're still on that.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?",,,,,,Rachel
 (looks puzzled) How...how...?,,,,,,Rachel
 uh-huh,,,,,,Rachel
 (to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake...,,,,,,Rachel
 What...how is it going with Drake?,,,,,,Rachel
 What...that scene I saw was so good!,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?",,,,,,Rachel
 So?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?",,,,,,Rachel
 Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?,,,,,,Rachel
" (shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.",,,,,,Rachel
" (looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...",,,,,,Rachel
" (gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but Joey blocks her way) Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh... oooh... (pause) (Rachel is all bah-jiggity about Joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to Monica) Can I ask you a question?",,,,,,Rachel
 Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?,,,,,,Rachel
 No reason.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah,,,,,,Rachel
" (with high pitched voice) Nobody, forget it!",,,,,,Rachel
 (giggling and whispering) Maybe.,,,,,,Rachel
" (whispering) Why? (Monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with ""because"") Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.",,,,,,Rachel
 I know them from work.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, one of them...",,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know, what were the names I just said?",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we (Joey enters the hall) Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion? (Joey enters his apartment)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine)",,,,,,Rachel
 (angry) You are having a party tonight??,,,,,,Rachel
 And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?,,,,,,Rachel
 You do that every year??,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??",,,,,,Rachel
 And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?,,,,,,Rachel
" OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, then so you just invite me...!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...",,,,,,Rachel
" (yelling and jumping like a child) OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! (realizing how she's behaving) And it's out of my system!",,,,,,Rachel
" (she enters wearing a bath-robe) Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.",,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!",,,,,,Rachel
" ... Ok, who is this?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!",,,,,,Rachel
 Sure! (Monica takes her apart) Oh...,,,,,,Rachel
" What? Yes, I am!",,,,,,Rachel
" When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!",,,,,,Rachel
 Ok! (whispering) Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!,,,,,,Rachel
 And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ok professor or detective?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.",,,,,,Rachel
 Nice to meet you.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ok,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!",,,,,,Rachel
 I always loved that!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves),,,,,,Rachel
 (drunken voice) I think I am.,,,,,,Rachel
" (picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, you're so sweet.",,,,,,Rachel
 Who (looks around)?,,,,,,Rachel
 (surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Very funny... Joey.",,,,,,Rachel
 (to Monica) Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
" I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.",,,,,,Rachel
" Please, what about you and Chandler?",,,,,,Rachel
 Well hello (points to herself)!,,,,,,Rachel
" I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!",,,,,,Rachel
 (pause) I'm gonna do it.,,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!",,,,,,Rachel
 (worried) Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?",,,,,,Rachel
" (after a pause) Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I would like to have the option!!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!",,,,,,Rachel
 I don't care about any of that!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!",,,,,,Rachel
 I promise.,,,,,,Rachel
 But I am going hunting!!,,,,,,Rachel
 (to the receptionist) Hi there!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.",,,,,,Rachel
 And... taped back together.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ok,,,,,,Rachel
 (imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors.,,,,,,Rachel
 Alright-y then.,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her head in the hole and Phoebe enters)",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh... what an interesting name.,,,,,,Rachel
 You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's direction),,,,,,Rachel
 (Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers),,,,,,Rachel
" No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause) Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?",,,,,,Rachel
 Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated),,,,,,Rachel
 I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...,,,,,,Rachel
 (now lifts her head) Phoebe!!,,,,,,Rachel
" For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!",,,,,,Rachel
 How could you not tell me you worked here?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?",,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!",,,,,,Rachel
 Good for you Pheebs!,,,,,,Rachel
" (speaking to herself and reading Cosmopolitan) Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live s*x show!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, yeah... It's... ""climax your way to better skin"".",,,,,,Rachel
" (hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah...,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well...",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!",,,,,,Rachel
" Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!",,,,,,Rachel
 And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.",,,,,,Rachel
 That's not what we're gonna do!,,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?",,,,,,Rachel
 Not gonna find any clothes in there!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?",,,,,,Rachel
 I'm there!,,,,,,Rachel
" Bye, see ya. (she goes)",,,,,,Rachel
" Pheebs, that's for men!",,,,,,Rachel
" On Melanie Griffith in ""Working girl"". I think what you want is over here.",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!",,,,,,Rachel
 Sure!,,,,,,Rachel
 You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.,,,,,,Rachel
" She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!",,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!",,,,,,Rachel
" Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...",,,,,,Rachel
" Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.",,,,,,Rachel
" It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!",,,,,,Rachel
" (annoyed) Oh, I get it!",,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.",,,,,,Rachel
 So can we keep this between us?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, great!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!",,,,,,Rachel
" (sticks her head out too) Well, get back in there and talk!",,,,,,Rachel
 (comes out again) What!?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! What are we gonna do?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
 (yelling at the stranger) Alright! Enough out of you!,,,,,,Rachel
 Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ok. (Phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. Rachel sees and follows her) Wha...? where? Where are you going?,,,,,,Rachel
" (to Charlie) Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?",,,,,,Rachel
" (pretends to be stunned) Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.",,,,,,Rachel
 (after a pause) Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah...,,,,,,Rachel
 (Looks ashamed) I try...,,,,,,Rachel
" No, that's David.",,,,,,Rachel
 (disapprovingly) Tip of the iceberg.,,,,,,Rachel
 Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! Hey what's going on?,,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could (looks at Joey who is at the check in desk) share that with a guy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.",,,,,,Rachel
" (looking out the window) What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.",,,,,,Rachel
 It's not the time Charlie.,,,,,,Rachel
" You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ugh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I've brought some books. We could read.",,,,,,Rachel
 We can't. We're not pharmacists!,,,,,,Rachel
 (picking up another random badge) Kate Miller?,,,,,,Rachel
 And... that's the most s*x I'm gonna have this weekend.,,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you. (they walk away),,,,,,Rachel
" I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...",,,,,,Rachel
" (takes a sip from her drink, embarassed) No.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.",,,,,,Rachel
 No.,,,,,,Rachel
 Joey! (she walks away; Joey goes after her teasing and tickling her),,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! (pause) Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?",,,,,,Rachel
 Do ya?,,,,,,Rachel
 Later! La...,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok. See you, bye.",,,,,,Rachel
 (walking in hurriedly) Open your drapes! Open your drapes!,,,,,,Rachel
 Nooo!,,,,,,Rachel
" Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!",,,,,,Rachel
 Homo.,,,,,,Rachel
" All right! Well, uh... (to Monica) we're gonna hit the beach?",,,,,,Rachel
" (to Ross, in a flattering tone) It was really... great!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! Weather bitch! (turns the TV off),,,,,,Rachel
" It's open! (Joey walks in) Hi, Joe!",,,,,,Rachel
" (worried) What, is everything ok?",,,,,,Rachel
" Nooooo, why?",,,,,,Rachel
" (laughing) Oh, that's crazy!",,,,,,Rachel
" ... yeah, it's true.",,,,,,Rachel
" (pretending to be offended) What, hey!",,,,,,Rachel
" W-What are you, what are you talking about?",,,,,,Rachel
 Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I'm not talking about her...",,,,,,Rachel
 You know? Forget it!,,,,,,Rachel
" No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, sure!",,,,,,Rachel
" (nearly whispering) Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!",,,,,,Rachel
" Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts (pauses) musings, if you will!",,,,,,Rachel
 Only like a month!,,,,,,Rachel
" What the... DIAL IT DOWN! (Joey goes to sit on the bed) Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! (looks at Joey, who's totally distraught) Ok, dial it up a little!",,,,,,Rachel
 Shoot!,,,,,,Rachel
" I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... (insinuating) what that would be like?...",,,,,,Rachel
 (puzzled) Who...?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yes, of course, I remember him!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, he did! (smiling) Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!",,,,,,Rachel
 But can it... just... happen a little bit?,,,,,,Rachel
" But why, why not?",,,,,,Rachel
 But that wasn't gonna stop you before!,,,,,,Rachel
" (regretful) I'm sorry, too! (they look at each other sadly, then she recollects, and puts her hands over her eyes) OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!",,,,,,Rachel
 It's not a big deal!,,,,,,Rachel
 It's so not a big deal!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ok!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, I...",,,,,,Rachel
 AAAHHHH!,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 (through wall) Ooh... I love Barbados!,,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I'm her!",,,,,,Rachel
 ooh...,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?",,,,,,Rachel
" What? Ross and Charlie? (Joey nods) Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. (Joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) That's not nonchalant!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh... okay, just hide!",,,,,,Rachel
" Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!",,,,,,Rachel
 There's no room under the bed. (looks around because she can't find Joey anymore),,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah... (still looking to see where Joey went, and opens the door)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi...,,,,,,Rachel
 ...I really don't... (looks around again),,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, sure... (looks outside into the corridor if Joey is there)",,,,,,Rachel
 (clearly not listening and still trying to find out where Joey went) Uh-huh... right... yeah...,,,,,,Rachel
" (still searching) Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.",,,,,,Rachel
" (now looking up at the ceiling) That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.",,,,,,Rachel
 You would think!,,,,,,Rachel
 Joey!,,,,,,Rachel
 (still can't find him) How are you doing this?,,,,,,Rachel
 How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!",,,,,,Rachel
" All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...",,,,,,Rachel
 Sure...,,,,,,Rachel
 Get out!,,,,,,Rachel
 Are they right?,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.",,,,,,Rachel
 (Joey walks to the door) Although...,,,,,,Rachel
" I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...",,,,,,Rachel
" Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.",,,,,,Rachel
 No...,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah...,,,,,,Rachel
 Forgotten.,,,,,,Rachel
 Nothing...,,,,,,Rachel
" Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...",,,,,,Rachel
" Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...",,,,,,Rachel
 Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.",,,,,,Rachel
 Still nervous?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah! (mouths ""Good luck"" to Joey and gets up from her seat)",,,,,,Rachel
 So hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" So you eh, you talked to Joey?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! That's great!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, so everything's okay?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.",,,,,,Rachel
 Really? Excited?,,,,,,Rachel
" Excuse me! (and she walks back to Joey, who is still looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and hits him.) You didn't tell him, did you?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.",,,,,,Rachel
" That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.",,,,,,Rachel
" Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.",,,,,,Rachel
 What? What is it?,,,,,,Rachel
" Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.",,,,,,Rachel
 Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...",,,,,,Rachel
" Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...",,,,,,Rachel
" No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?",,,,,,Rachel
 Goo--ood night!,,,,,,Rachel
" Seriously, good night!",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 We weren't doing anything!,,,,,,Rachel
 Shhh.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.",,,,,,Rachel
" We feel so terrible about this, Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ross? (to Joey) Can we just close the door?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, say something. Anything.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, no, no!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, but you know what I mean.",,,,,,Rachel
 Calm ourselves?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, what would we be doing?",,,,,,Rachel
 Feel me up?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you bet.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay, well, we brought you some wine.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.",,,,,,Rachel
 No awareness.,,,,,,Rachel
" Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!",,,,,,Rachel
 Ooy.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, you don't seem okay.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.",,,,,,Rachel
" You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, no, it's just that it's getting late...",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, that's probably a good idea.",,,,,,Rachel
" Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thanks for dinner.,,,,,,Rachel
 So.,,,,,,Rachel
" I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok.",,,,,,Rachel
" I am sorry, I don’t know, I am sorry, I don’t know why I did that!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, so sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
" I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don’t know what happened, I must be nervous!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.",,,,,,Rachel
" Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, let’s work from the top down! (Joey nods, but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra, Joe!",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ow!,,,,,,Rachel
 Well this is romantic!,,,,,,Rachel
 It’s a standard issue bra clasp!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?",,,,,,Rachel
 (laughing) oooh! Oh oh!,,,,,,Rachel
 oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!",,,,,,Rachel
" I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.",,,,,,Rachel
" (looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!",,,,,,Rachel
" (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey! Got champagne?,,,,,,Rachel
" Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove her bra from under her clothes)...",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright! Lets do it!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like that huh?",,,,,,Rachel
" You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively, putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!",,,,,,Rachel
 What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?,,,,,,Rachel
 What is the matter with us?,,,,,,Rachel
" No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?",,,,,,Rachel
" Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?",,,,,,Rachel
" No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.",,,,,,Rachel
" Right, totally.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have s*x.",,,,,,Rachel
 I know.,,,,,,Rachel
 Hmmm... Me too...,,,,,,Rachel
 I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?,,,,,,Rachel
 Aah... I bet you're right.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.",,,,,,Rachel
" Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!",,,,,,Rachel
 We're having a party.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?",,,,,,Rachel
" And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!",,,,,,Rachel
" You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.",,,,,,Rachel
 I said it's still nap time.,,,,,,Rachel
" Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, she's still napping",,,,,,Rachel
" Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.",,,,,,Rachel
" No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! Emma might like what?,,,,,,Rachel
 What did you get her?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?",,,,,,Rachel
" (to everybody) All right, let’s get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.",,,,,,Rachel
" So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, ok, which one?",,,,,,Rachel
 (crying) Wow! That was amazing!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.",,,,,,Rachel
 Is that it?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s in a box in the fridge.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino’s.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) oh! Oh my God! They put my baby’s face on a pen1s!",,,,,,Rachel
" Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a piece and yells at him) Joey, don't touch it!!",,,,,,Rachel
" (speaking to the person on the phone again) Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!",,,,,,Rachel
" (into the phone) No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) Bye...",,,,,,Rachel
 OOH! God! Sorry!,,,,,,Rachel
 Emma's awake.,,,,,,Rachel
 I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.",,,,,,Rachel
" (shakes her head) I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing ""Happy Birthday"". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! (honks furiously, and Ross looks at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.) They have to learn!",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 (she looks at the cake) Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I'm very impressed.",,,,,,Rachel
 I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!",,,,,,Rachel
" (angrily) NO, no science camp!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.",,,,,,Rachel
 Okay.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. (they both look into the camera, and Ross waves.) Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...",,,,,,Rachel
" You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.",,,,,,Rachel
 I've never given her a cookie. Have you?,,,,,,Rachel
" Of course, I'd be honored!",,,,,,Rachel
" OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had s*x...",,,,,,Rachel
 Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! (they hug) Wow! You remember Joey?,,,,,,Rachel
" So now, what are you doing here?",,,,,,Rachel
" (Emma starts crying in the other room) Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!",,,,,,Rachel
 God!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I know, isn't she?",,,,,,Rachel
" All right. What's your news, Amy?",,,,,,Rachel
 What? Oh my God! To who?,,,,,,Rachel
 A-And??,,,,,,Rachel
" No, what's he like?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...",,,,,,Rachel
" Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?",,,,,,Rachel
" Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!",,,,,,Rachel
 Ok.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, let’s keep talking.",,,,,,Rachel
" Amy, hi!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, good for you!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!",,,,,,Rachel
 But Erin Brockovich had her own house.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get off!’",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, I can’t do that!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think it’s really good that she’s here.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok.",,,,,,Rachel
" Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why I hung it on the door.",,,,,,Rachel
" Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, what happened?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that is so tacky.",,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, that’s huge!",,,,,,Rachel
 I think it could be kind of great!,,,,,,Rachel
" (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands together, faking excitement)",,,,,,Rachel
" (Takes the phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!",,,,,,Rachel
" (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?",,,,,,Rachel
 Menstrual cramps.,,,,,,Rachel
" (To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?",,,,,,Rachel
" (To Ross) Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?",,,,,,Rachel
" (Thinks for a moment) Well, actually...",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
 Why not?,,,,,,Rachel
" (Defends Amy) Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!",,,,,,Rachel
 (Shocked) Wha... the next one?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?",,,,,,Rachel
 Absolutely.,,,,,,Rachel
" (To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl?",,,,,,Rachel
 (sounds excited) Yeah!,,,,,,Rachel
 (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!?,,,,,,Rachel
 You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it),,,,,,Rachel
" Nah, I don't really want her to see.",,,,,,Rachel
 Nothing.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, they're real!",,,,,,Rachel
" I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy) You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!",,,,,,Rachel
 I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh yeah? Since when?,,,,,,Rachel
 (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?,,,,,,Rachel
 (shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim.,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!",,,,,,Rachel
 You put holes in my baby's ears!,,,,,,Rachel
 (gasps) I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.,,,,,,Rachel
 Excuse me?,,,,,,Rachel
" (yelling) Joey, where are those bags?",,,,,,Rachel
 (doesn't believe what she's hearing) Seriously?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hips or thighs?,,,,,,Rachel
 (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.,,,,,,Rachel
" (embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.",,,,,,Rachel
 Did you just say Emma?,,,,,,Rachel
 So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?,,,,,,Rachel
 That's shocking!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 My God!,,,,,,Rachel
 Congratulations! Wow!!,,,,,,Rachel
 Mmh-mmh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?",,,,,,Rachel
" (angrily) GIVE ME THE BOOK! (she takes it and start reading) Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, ""Guy-in-van""?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
" I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.",,,,,,Rachel
" Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.",,,,,,Rachel
 Who's Gladys?,,,,,,Rachel
" (sarcastic) Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I couldn't let you do that.",,,,,,Rachel
 But I don't want you to.,,,,,,Rachel
 But I insist harder!,,,,,,Rachel
" (sarcastic) No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!",,,,,,Rachel
 Did you watch the tape?,,,,,,Rachel
 But you are a liar.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, this is going well. (Chandler looks worried)",,,,,,Rachel
" (surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly? (looks around for a spot)",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!",,,,,,Rachel
 (jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!,,,,,,Rachel
 O-oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?",,,,,,Rachel
" Joey, we're not keeping this!",,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.",,,,,,Rachel
" She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice) And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game. (gives Gladys to Monica)",,,,,,Rachel
 Yes I can! (pushes her back again),,,,,,Rachel
 She's yours!,,,,,,Rachel
 She's yours!,,,,,,Rachel
 She's mine!,,,,,,Rachel
 She's mine!,,,,,,Rachel
 I want Gladys!,,,,,,Rachel
 She's mine!,,,,,,Rachel
 She's mine!,,,,,,Rachel
 Excellent!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, don't be such a baby!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.",,,,,,Rachel
 Absolutely.,,,,,,Rachel
" So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh my God, what!?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.",,,,,,Rachel
" (upset) All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! (crying) And it was uneven for weeks!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!",,,,,,Rachel
 All right!,,,,,,Rachel
" Irrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, careful.",,,,,,Rachel
" Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!",,,,,,Rachel
" I know (she touches Emma’s head) but they’re just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ok.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ok.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, careful, ok. (Emma giggles) Oh, she’s smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!",,,,,,Rachel
" Awe! (Emma laughs) Oh my God! Looks, she’s a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok. Oh God. (To Ross) Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets",,,,,,Rachel
 (looks at him suspiciously) I know what this is all about... You've always been,,,,,,Rachel
 Alright fine. I'll do it.,,,,,,Rachel
 If you hold a spider.,,,,,,Rachel
 IF you hold a spider.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ok... (and passes the spider to Ross who holds it in between his hands),,,,,,Rachel
 (reluctantly) Ok... O-k...,,,,,,Rachel
 (more confident) Ok...,,,,,,Rachel
 whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!,,,,,,Rachel
 A-alright! I can do this.,,,,,,Rachel
 That's because he's on your neck.,,,,,,Rachel
 ROSS!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!,,,,,,Rachel
 It's not? (whispering to Ross) When was she born?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!,,,,,,Rachel
 Did you at least win the contest?,,,,,,Rachel
 Can't wait!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!",,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...",,,,,,Rachel
 And a thousand dollars.,,,,,,Rachel
" ...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that (in a deep voice, mocking Ross) what's in the inside is important...",,,,,,Rachel
 Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!",,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!",,,,,,Rachel
" Phoebe, you have to calm down.",,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
 You heard them say that?,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!",,,,,,Rachel
" No, what?",,,,,,Rachel
" No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!",,,,,,Rachel
 Because I already did!,,,,,,Rachel
 No...,,,,,,Rachel
 What are you doing here!,,,,,,Rachel
 And I won!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes! (spells it) Y-E-S. Yes!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. That's me!,,,,,,Rachel
 She won a thousand dollars!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.",,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, Emma is napping... (then to Ross) what happened to your shirt?",,,,,,Rachel
" You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. (When she finishes talking, a note is pushed from under Monica's and Chandler's door, into the hall. Ross picks it up and reads it out loud)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. (they all agree) Ready? (they do the rock-paper-scissor thing with they hands and Rachel has paper, Phoebe and Ross both have rock, while Joey is doing a strange upward wiggling with his fingers. They all look a him confused).",,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.",,,,,,Rachel
" Alright, come on... (starts to knock on the door) Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.",,,,,,Rachel
" You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. (A slice of turkey on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)",,,,,,Rachel
" (gasps) Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.",,,,,,Rachel
 Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS. (they all look appalled),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I know... I still have my old key! (She goes in to get it and comes back with her keys) We can just unlock the door.",,,,,,Rachel
" You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together. (Goes to unlock the door)",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
 So bad.,,,,,,Rachel
 Dessert?,,,,,,Rachel
 Congratulatioooons!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ewww, is that what that is?",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah! I'll cook!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey!,,,,,,Rachel
 I lent them to Ross.,,,,,,Rachel
 I'm so happy for you!,,,,,,Rachel
 To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.,,,,,,Rachel
 Really?,,,,,,Rachel
" (to Joey) Hey, who's Phoebe with?",,,,,,Rachel
 Do you think I'm someone else?,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... (Ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) There you go! (pause) Now throw it away!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi,,,,,,Rachel
 what?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Oh, no!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh no! Not me! Emma!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ah, this place is great!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). I mean, this is just beautiful!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!",,,,,,Rachel
" No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you.",,,,,,Rachel
 (to Phoebe) Why do men keep talking to me like this?,,,,,,Rachel
 We got some really great stuff!,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?,,,,,,Rachel
 (looking into one of her shopping bags) Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by,,,,,,Rachel
" My God, get a room!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, s*x or food?",,,,,,Rachel
" No, you gotta pick one!",,,,,,Rachel
 You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, no, no. That is a doll.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.",,,,,,Rachel
 He's not having an affair!,,,,,,Rachel
" No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, that doesn't mean anything.",,,,,,Rachel
" (whispering) ""Dude, Where's My Car?""",,,,,,Rachel
 They're in a caaar...,,,,,,Rachel
 Geez!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.",,,,,,Rachel
" I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, look at her, so happy!",,,,,,Rachel
 Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.,,,,,,Rachel
 Who's Nancy?,,,,,,Rachel
 Are you serious?,,,,,,Rachel
" What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah it is.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!",,,,,,Rachel
" (talking on the phone) C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!",,,,,,Rachel
 Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.,,,,,,Rachel
" You're fly is open, Geller!",,,,,,Rachel
" Ow, that had to hurt!",,,,,,Rachel
" No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oooohh that’s interesting.,,,,,,Rachel
 14?,,,,,,Rachel
 Space cowboy!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ow...Oh Gosh!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!",,,,,,Rachel
" Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!",,,,,,Rachel
 That is not true. She did! She forced me!,,,,,,Rachel
" Well it stupid, unfair question!",,,,,,Rachel
" (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!",,,,,,Rachel
" Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.",,,,,,Rachel
 And a crappy New Year.,,,,,,Rachel
 You can't move. You just... you just can't.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... (nods towards Ross) maybe close your blinds at night.",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.",,,,,,Rachel
 Aah! Why? What are these for?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful. (she got a scarf),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, d'you like it?",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.",,,,,,Rachel
" Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.",,,,,,Rachel
" Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!",,,,,,Rachel
 (pretends to be shocked) Uh! The police!,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah?,,,,,,Rachel
" All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!",,,,,,Rachel
" No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!",,,,,,Rachel
 This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!,,,,,,Rachel
" I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them! (They spot Chandler)",,,,,,Rachel
 It... You can so totally tell.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. (They walk towards Chandler) Hey, how's it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails).",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, Rachel. And this (points to Monica) is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do).",,,,,,Rachel
 Bitchin',,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
 I am sooo drunk.,,,,,,Rachel
 (finishing the last of her drink) I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.,,,,,,Rachel
 (sarcastic) Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?,,,,,,Rachel
" (blushing) Oh, what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards Chandler and whispers ""Oh my God!"")",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... (Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She pulls away) Hey!",,,,,,Rachel
 (She considers it for a second) Yeah okay. (She puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing again),,,,,,Rachel
" No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?",,,,,,Rachel
 So maybe something in an office.,,,,,,Rachel
 (to Phoebe) Really?,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.",,,,,,Rachel
 Uh... November?,,,,,,Rachel
 Hey Pheebs...,,,,,,Rachel
 Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, this is really awkward (staring at the floor) Oh, and I can leave!",,,,,,Rachel
" (excited and clapping her hands in front of her face) Goody, what is it!",,,,,,Rachel
" What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.",,,,,,Rachel
 Happy wedding day!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.",,,,,,Rachel
 What d'you want?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi,,,,,,Rachel
" Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.",,,,,,Rachel
" All right fine, I pick you.",,,,,,Rachel
 (not amused by his pun but forcing a smile anyway) Oh my...,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.",,,,,,Rachel
 Who's there?,,,,,,Rachel
 Uh.,,,,,,Rachel
" You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.",,,,,,Rachel
" (sarcastic) Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.",,,,,,Rachel
 Since when do you watch the news?,,,,,,Rachel
" Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey. (she gives her a kiss)",,,,,,Rachel
" Geez Ross, you could have showered.",,,,,,Rachel
 How was the honeymoon?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
 I did not know you spoke French.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh... you're so sexy!,,,,,,Rachel
" Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ross...,,,,,,Rachel
 My father had an heart attack... (crying) ...while I was at Barney’s.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, come on, I'm totally ok. (hugging him) I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ok. If you really need to.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, I really could.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ohh... (Ross mouths HA-HA at Monica and takes two cookies and she looks at him angrily),,,,,,Rachel
" (stopping a nurse who's coming out of a room) Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.",,,,,,Rachel
 Can somebody please go in?,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! (They enter. Rachel sees his father, lying on a bed, with tubes, drip and everything) Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 Uh. (pause) Did you call your parents?,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh good.,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 What do you mean? You've been in my room before!,,,,,,Rachel
" Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.",,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!",,,,,,Rachel
 (she's sad) Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!,,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?",,,,,,Rachel
" Ok, maybe you're right.",,,,,,Rachel
" Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?",,,,,,Rachel
 Ok. (She sits on the bed and Ross sits near her) Thank you for coming with me today.,,,,,,Rachel
 Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!,,,,,,Rachel
 I just don't want to be alone tonight.,,,,,,Rachel
" Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?",,,,,,Rachel
" Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!",,,,,,Rachel
 Wow. Ok.,,,,,,Rachel
 Mhm-mh!,,,,,,Rachel
" (She turns around very slowly, looks at him for a second and then turns back to her coffee) Sure. (She gives him the cup she was pouring for herself without looking at him)",,,,,,Rachel
" Hmm-hmm. (starts to pour herself a cup of coffee, never looking at Ross)",,,,,,Rachel
 (coldly) Yep.,,,,,,Rachel
 FYI..,,,,,,Rachel
" In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy s*x... just do it. (she smiles fakely at him)",,,,,,Rachel
" (sarcastically) Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh stop that!,,,,,,Rachel
" (sarcastic) Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either. (She turns to leave and Ross over takes her and stands infront on her, his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms)",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, good.",,,,,,Rachel
" Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say ""thank you"" for coming with me.",,,,,,Rachel
" And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole s*x thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.",,,,,,Rachel
" It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.",,,,,,Rachel
" Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?",,,,,,Rachel
 You know it was you're uhm... birthday...,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.",,,,,,Rachel
 (after a pause) Not even one more time?,,,,,,Rachel
 No matter how much we want it.,,,,,,Rachel
 That's what we decided.,,,,,,Rachel
 ...It's kinda hard though!,,,,,,Rachel
" You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.",,,,,,Rachel
 ...Ross?,,,,,,Rachel
 Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table. (she enters her room and closes the door.),,,,,,Rachel
 (while entering) Hi you guys.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ooh, Italian! (she also grabs a plate)",,,,,,Rachel
 Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.,,,,,,Rachel
 Congratulations!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ooh! (they hug),,,,,,Rachel
" (to maitre d') Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.,,,,,,Rachel
 But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.,,,,,,Rachel
 Sssshhhh!,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi... I'm on a date...,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yes, hi!",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi! (to mr Zellner) Excuse us.,,,,,,Rachel
" Okay. Oh, yeah... (whispering to mr Zellner) Oh he's cute!",,,,,,Rachel
 Wha... My resumé? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.,,,,,,Rachel
 (starts singing la la la la) Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?,,,,,,Rachel
 What? I-I don't.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, I-I-I love it there.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh! It's not good.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said ""Wait a minute! Yes I am."" and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.",,,,,,Rachel
" Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!",,,,,,Rachel
" (crying) No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.",,,,,,Rachel
 Oh!,,,,,,Rachel
" No, it's okay, you didn't know.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, thank you... (looks at his face trying to remember his name)",,,,,,Rachel
" (Is embarrassed for a moment, but it quickly passes) Well, now I don't have to. (The man leaves instantly)",,,,,,Rachel
" (annoyed) Ross, what is taking you so long?",,,,,,Rachel
 (turns around) Mark? Oh my God! (puts the box on the chair and they hug each other),,,,,,Rachel
 I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well, (looks at her box and chair) you're not catching me on my best day.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.",,,,,,Rachel
" Well, screw charity work. What've you got?",,,,,,Rachel
 Great! I'll call ya!,,,,,,Rachel
 (very excited) Oh my God!,,,,,,Rachel
 Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yes.,,,,,,Rachel
 Oh.,,,,,,Rachel
 What? You don't want me to get a job?,,,,,,Rachel
 Ugh.,,,,,,Rachel
" Ross, you know what? (looks over to the door and sees security staring at them) Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security. (Takes her box and leaves. Ross follows her and then returns for the chair. He stands for a moment, then pushes it quickly in the general direction Rachel went into, and out of the camera's view, and then nonchalantly walks away)",,,,,,Rachel
 (entering) Hi you guys!,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.",,,,,,Rachel
 He offered me one.,,,,,,Rachel
" I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...",,,,,,Rachel
 The job is in Paris. (they all stare at each other),,,,,,Rachel
 He offered me one.,,,,,,Rachel
 The job is in Paris. (we see Ross stare in disbelief),,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.",,,,,,Rachel
" I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.",,,,,,Rachel
" I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.",,,,,,Rachel
 Thank you! Thank you!,,,,,,Rachel
 I think it is. (Ross looks very sad. Phoebe and Joey enter.),,,,,,Rachel
 I got a really incredible job offer.,,,,,,Rachel
 It's in Paris.,,,,,,Rachel
" Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.",,,,,,Rachel
" (walking towards Joey) Joey, it would mean so...",,,,,,Rachel
 Joey...,,,,,,Rachel
 Hi.,,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, well, she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!",,,,,,Rachel
" Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.",,,,,,Rachel
" No, I’m still going.",,,,,,Rachel
" When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn’t that great?",,,,,,Rachel
 Hi!,,,,,,Rachel
 You are never going to believe what happened to me today.,,,,,,Rachel
 Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.,,,,,,Rachel
 Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.,,,,,,Rachel
" Well, I took it.",,,,,,Rachel
" (hesitant) Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice...",,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can... (she sits down, and Ross who is stunned to hear all this follows her example)",,,,,,Rachel
" Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. (they both stare around)",,,,,,Rachel
 What?,,,,,,Rachel
 You really think so?,,,,,,Rachel
 But I already told Zelner that I would come back...,,,,,,Rachel
 All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.,,,,,,Rachel
" Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!",,,,,,Rachel
" Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.",,,,,,Rachel
" Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself. ",,,,,,Rachel
" So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken.",,,,,,Rachel
 Ok.,,,,,,Rachel
" No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter’s birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!",,,,,,Rachel
" Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? (To Monica.) What's up?",,,,,,Rachel
