35, Hi. ,ross
36," So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?",monica
37," Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realised that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, he always looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.",rachel
38, Who wasn't invited to the wedding.,monica
39," Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...",rachel
40," Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. ",monica
41,"  Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! ",rachel
42,"  Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.",chandler
43, I say push her down the stairs.,joey
44," C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!",rachel
45, You can see where he'd have trouble.,ross
46," Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. ",rachel
47," Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...",monica
48," Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!",rachel
49," Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...",monica
50,"  Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, ..bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...",phoebe
51, I'm all better now.,rachel
52,  I helped!,phoebe
53," Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.",monica
54,"  And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.",joey
55," Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!",monica

77," Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!",rachel
78," Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.",ross
79,"  Yes, and we're very excited about it. ",chandler
80," Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight..",rachel
81," Okay, sure.",ross
82," Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?",joey
83," Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.",phoebe
84,"  I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little whim guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.",ross
85, What's this?,joey
86, I have no idea.,chandler
87, Done with the bookcase!,joey
88, All finished!,chandler
89,"  This was Carol's favourite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.",ross

91, You guys.,ross
92," Oh, man.",chandler
93, You got screwed.,joey

96, -leg?,monica
97, You actually broke her watch?,monica
98," Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...",rachel
99," You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...",ross
100," What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavour of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavours out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!",joey
101, I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.,ross
102, Stay out of my freezer!,chandler
103," What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?",monica
104," Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?",monica
105," Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?",monica
106,"  Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...",monica
107, Being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?,monica
108, Wow! I'm glad you smashed her watch! ,monica
109," ...Yeah. Yeah, I do.",monica
110, Oh...see... but Joanie loved Chachi! That's the difference!,rachel
111,"  Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you? Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? ",ross
112," Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.",rachel
113, That is amazing.,chandler
114," Congratulations. And while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelette or something...  Although actually I'm really not that hungry...",joey
115," Morning, Paul.",joey
116," Hello, Paul.",rachel
117," Hi, Paul, is it?",chandler
118, I had a really great time last night.,monica
119, We'll talk later.,monica
120, That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?,joey
121," Shut up, and put my table back.",monica
122," All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... ",chandler
123," So, like, you guys all have jobs?",rachel
124," Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.",monica
125," Yeah, I'm an actor.",joey
126, Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?,rachel
127, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.,joey
128," Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio.",monica
129," 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'",chandler
130, I will not take this abuse. ,joey
131," You're right, I'm sorry.  'Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..'",chandler
132, So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.,monica
133, I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.,rachel
134," I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?",monica
135," Oh, yeah.",rachel
136," Well, it's like that. With feelings.",monica
137, Oh wow. Are you in trouble.,rachel
138," Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.",monica
139," Oh, look, wish me luck!",rachel
140, What for?,monica
141, I'm gonna go get one of those job things.,rachel
142," Hey, welcome back! How was Florida?",monica
143, How do you do that?,monica
144, You know Paul?,monica
145, You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?,monica
146, Of course it was a line!,joey
147," Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?",monica
148, I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.,ross
149, Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?,monica
150," All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. ",phoebe
151," I just thought he was nice, y'know?",monica
152,  I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!,joey
153, Guess what?,rachel
154, You got a job?,ross
155, Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.,rachel
156, And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.,chandler
157," You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!",rachel
158," Oh, how well you know me...",chandler
159," They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!",rachel
160, How'd you pay for them?,monica
161," Uh, credit card.",rachel
162, And who pays for that?,monica
163, Um... my... father.,rachel
164," C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.",monica
165, I know that. That's why I was getting married.,rachel
166," Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. ",phoebe
167, Thank you.,rachel
168," You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windows outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.",phoebe
169, The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...,ross
170, You ready?,monica
171, I don't think so.,rachel
172," C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...",ross
173, Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!,monica

176," No. No, I gotta go home sometime.",ross
177, You be okay?,monica
178, Yeah.,ross
179," Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?",rachel
180," That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody. ",monica
181," Mmm.  Oh, no-",ross
182, Sorry-,rachel
183," No no no, go-",ross
184," No, you have it, really, I don't want it-",rachel
185, Split it?,ross
186, Okay.,rachel
187," Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.",ross
188, I knew.,rachel
189, You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.,ross
190, I did.,rachel
191," Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?",ross
192," Yeah, maybe...",rachel
193," Okay... okay, maybe I will...",ross
194, Goodnight.,rachel
195, Goodnight.,ross
196," See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?",monica
197, I just grabbed a spoon. ,ross
198, I can't believe what I'm hearing here.,joey
199,  I can't believe what I'm hearing here...,phoebe
200, What? I-I said you had a-,monica
201,  What I said...,phoebe
202,  Would you stop?,monica
203," Oh, was I doing it again?",phoebe
204,  Would anybody like more coffee?,rachel
205," Did you make it, or are you just serving it?",chandler
206, I'm just serving it.,rachel
207," Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. I'm Liza Minelli-",chandler
208," What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.",monica
209," Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?",joey
210," Oh, yeah! ",phoebe
211, Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.,rachel
212, Absolutely.,monica
213," Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.",chandler
214," Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.",ross
215," The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.",chandler
216," Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.",rachel
217, ....Are we still talking about s*x?,joey
218," No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?",ross
219, Does she.,ross
220," Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?",ross
221,  No. No.,ross
222," Okay, okay, yes, it is.  How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.",ross
223,Hi.,ross
224," You look great. I, uh... I hate that.",ross
225," Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...",ross
226," Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?",ross
227," Why- why are you here, Carol?",ross
228, Pregnant?!,ross
229," Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.",chandler
230,...Then I've already seen this one! ,phoebe
231,  Are you through with that?,monica
232," Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.",joey
233, Whose little ball of paper is this?!,monica
234," Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.",chandler
235," She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!",phoebe
236," Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.",monica
237," Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.",chandler
238," Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.",phoebe
239," Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.",joey
240," That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. ",monica
241,"  Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!",chandler
242, What? ,monica
243, Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!,chandler
244, Has anybody seen my engagement ring?,rachel
245," Yeah, it's beautiful.",phoebe
246," Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... ",rachel
247," No, look, don't touch that!",phoebe
248," Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...",rachel
249," Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!",monica
250," Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?",joey
251, Doy! Probably right before she lost it!,phoebe
252, You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...,chandler
253," I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...",rachel
254, ...Dinah?,chandler
255,"  Ohhhhh, don't be mad...",rachel
256, You didn't.,monica
257," Oh, I am sorry...",rachel
258, I gave you one job! ,monica
259," Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!",rachel
260," Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...",chandler
261,  I just... can't do it.,monica
262, Boys? We're going in.,chandler
263, .....Hi.,ross
264, Wow. That is not a happy hi.,monica
265, Carol's pregnant. ,ross
266,  Ooh! I found it!,phoebe
267, W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...,monica
268," Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. ",ross
269," Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?",chandler
270," Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?",rachel
271," Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.",ross
272, She is so great! I miss her.,phoebe
273, What does she mean by 'involved'?,monica
274," I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.",chandler
275," Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.",ross
276, So what are you gonna do?,rachel
277," I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.",ross
278," .....Well, this is still ruined, right?",joey
279, Curry.,monica
280," I- I think they're great! I, I really do. ",ross
281," Aw, Mom...",ross
282," I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?",monica
283," No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.",monica
284," Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?",monica
285, Yeah. ,ross
286," I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.",monica
287, What's that supposed to mean?,monica
288, No it's not. ,monica
289,"  So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?",monica
290,"  Okay! Okay.  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.",ross
291," Your folks are really that bad, huh?",joey
292," Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.",ross
293," Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours.",monica
294, Must pee. ,ross
295," Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.",phoebe
296, You're twins?,rachel
297," Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.",phoebe
298, What does she do?,chandler
299, She's a waitress.,phoebe
300," All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. ",rachel
301," Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.",monica
302," Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.",chandler
303," The lights, please.. ",rachel
304, ...How long was I in there?,ross
305, I'm just cleaning up.,rachel

310, Mm-hmm..,ross
311, A lot.,rachel
312, Mm.,ross
313," So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?",rachel
314," Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...",ross
315," Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?",rachel
316, Got me.,ross
317, Remember when we were in high school together?,rachel

325,"  Hello, Susan.  Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?",ross
326, ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-,ross
327," -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?",ross
328," Okay, that's great.  No, I'm- Oh. ",ross
329,"  Quack, quack..",ross

378," What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?",rachel
379," Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'. ",monica
380, Since when?,rachel
381," Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.",joey
382, Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. ,chandler
383," Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.",phoebe
384, And everybody knows this?,rachel
385, Yeah. Cushions the blow.,joey
386," Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.",chandler

388," Uh, Ross.",monica

407," It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.",chandler
408," Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.",chandler
409, Y'miss it?,joey
410," Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke.  Oh.. my.. God. ",chandler
411," No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.",monica
412, That's ridiculous!,joey
413, Can I use.. either thumb?,ross
414,"  Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!  Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!",rachel

419," It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-",phoebe
420, Easy.,ross

422," Oh, Satan's minions at work again...",chandler
423," Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.",phoebe
424, What are you talking about? Keep it!,joey
425," It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.",phoebe
426," Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!",rachel
427," Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...",phoebe
428, We're with you. We got it.,monica

448," Well, then can we meet him?",rachel
449, Nope. Schhorry.,monica
450," I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.",monica
451," I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.",monica

458," 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.

465, C'mon!,monica
466," ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.",ross
467, Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?,monica
468, And did you notice...? ,rachel
469, Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.,joey
470," Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!",phoebe
471, ...What shoe?,ross
472," From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'",phoebe
473, ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.,ross
474," What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.",rachel
475, Really!,monica
476," Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? ",chandler
477," You know what I like most about him, though?",ross
478, The way he makes me feel about myself.,ross
479, Hi.. how was the game?,monica
480, Well..,ross
481, Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?,monica
482, Alan.,joey
483," He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...",ross
484," I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.",rachel
485," Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..",chandler
486, Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..,monica
487, What?,ross
488," ..I dunno, a little too Alan?",monica
489," Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.",rachel
490," Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.",ross
491, I personally could have a gallon of Alan.,chandler
492," Hey, Lizzie.",phoebe
493, I brought you alphabet soup.,phoebe
494," Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, ""sometimes y"". Uh, I also have something else for you. ",phoebe
495," No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?",phoebe
496, I know.,phoebe
497," No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.",phoebe

505," I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!",phoebe
506," Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?",chandler
507," Does, um, anyone wanna see?",phoebe
508, It's worse than the thumb!,rachel
509," Hey, this is so unfair!",chandler
510," Oh, why is it unfair?",monica
511," So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?",chandler
512, ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?,joey
513," Well, I-I could live without it.",rachel
514," Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?",joey
515," Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.",ross
516," Oh,  ""you do, do you""?",joey
517," You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.",ross

525," No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.",monica
526, Do you have any respect for your body?,joey
527, Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?,ross
528," Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.",chandler
529,"  Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.",rachel
530," Really? He does?  Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!  ",chandler

545," Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.",phoebe
546," And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!",phoebe
547,  What's going on?,joey
548, Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.,monica

559," No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.",monica
560, We didn't change..,rachel
561, So that's it? It's over? Just like that?,joey

So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?",rachel

698," Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together? ",rachel

719,"  No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.",rachel
720,  Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos'?,monica
721," Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?",monica
722, Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?,monica
723, And-and a power tie?,phoebe
724,  Oh God.,monica

748, I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.,ross
749," Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?",chandler
750," He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.",joey
751," Look, it's just a little more complicated...",ross
752," Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?",chandler
753," Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...",ross
754, Then what?,chandler
755, My first time with Carol was.. ,ross
756, What?,joey

783, Really?,joey
784," No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. ",chandler

797, Thanks. ,chandler
798," Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good. ",ross
799," Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.",chandler
800," Oh, okay. Will you take my place?",rachel
801," Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.",chandler

804, I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.,rachel
805," To the left, to the left- aww! ",chandler
806, Ohhh... I'm fine.,rachel
807, Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.,monica
808," Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?",ross
809, Come on! You guys can pee standing up.,rachel
810," We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.",chandler
811," Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.",joey
812," Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.",phoebe
813, Multiple orgasms!,ross
814," So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!",chandler
815," No plans, huh?",joey
816, Not a one.,chandler
817," Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?",ross
818," Oh, right, right, shut up.",chandler
819," Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.",monica
820," No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.",chandler
821," Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.",joey
822," You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.",phoebe
823," Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.",chandler
824," No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.",phoebe
825, Tony?,ross
826," Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?",monica
827," Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.",phoebe
828, [waitressing] Does anybody want anything else?,rachel
829," Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. [Rachel gives him a dirty look] Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.",ross
830, [to Rachel] What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?,phoebe
831, It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.,rachel
832," That guy, he burns me up.",ross
833," Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.",rachel
834," Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.",chandler
835," Did he give you that whole ""You're-not-up-to-this"" thing again?",monica
836," Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of ""You'll never make it on your own"".",rachel
837," [rhythmically] Uh-huh, uh-huh.",phoebe
838," My god, Angela.",joey
839," Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.",monica
840, Are you gonna go over there?,phoebe
841," No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. [he walks over to her] Hey, Angela.",joey
842, You look good.,joey
843, You don't say.,joey
844," So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?",ross
845," Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.",rachel
846," Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?",ross
847, Who?,rachel
848," Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?",ross
849, Don't you have a laundry room in your building?,rachel
850," Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?",ross
851, Sure.,rachel
852, Bob? Who the hell's Bob?,joey
853," Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.",joey
854, What?,joey
855," Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?",joey
856," You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.",joey
857," Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.",joey
858, Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.,monica
859," Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is--",joey
860," [looking out window] Oh, god help us.",monica
861, What?,joey
862, Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!,monica
863," Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.",joey
864, What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.,monica
865," [proud] I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?",joey
866," [on phone] Ok, bye. [hangs up] Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.",ross
867," Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?",chandler
868, It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.,ross
869," It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.",chandler
870, Nuh-uh.,ross
871, Yuh-huh.,chandler
872," So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?",ross
873," Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear--do you want it to be dirty?",chandler
874, [sheepish] No.,ross
875," Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?",chandler
876," Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.",ross
877, There you go.,chandler
878, Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?,monica
879, Yep.,joey
880, Which?,monica
881, Which what?,joey
882," You've never met Bob, have you?",monica
883," No, but he's--",joey
884," Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly--",monica
885, --horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.,monica
886, Where are they? Where are they?,chandler
887, This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.,phoebe
888, It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.,chandler
889," Eww, I don't wanna do that.",phoebe
890, Here we go.,chandler
891," Ok, have a good break-up.",phoebe
892," Hey, Janice.",chandler
893," Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?",chandler
894, What?,chandler
895, [covering] What... did you get me there?,chandler
896, Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.,chandler
897, That's great.,chandler
898," Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?",chandler
899, That's it?,chandler
900," Yeah, it was really hard.",phoebe
901," Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.",chandler
902," Ok, you weren't there.",phoebe
903," Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.",rachel
904, But I saved it. I put my basket on top.,rachel
905, What?,rachel
906, What's goin' on?,ross
907," Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.",rachel
908, Was your basket on top?,ross
909," Yeah, but, there were no suds.",rachel
910, So?,ross
911," Well, you know, no suds, no save.",rachel
912," No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. [to woman] That's my friend's machine.",ross
913," Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.",ross
914," [to the crowd in the laundromat] All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. [to Rachel] Ok, let's do laundry.",ross
915, That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.,rachel
916," Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.",ross
917, What's that?,rachel
918," Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.",ross
919," Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?",ross
920," Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?",rachel
921," Rach, have you never done this before?",ross
922," Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.",rachel
923," Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.",ross
924," [holds a pair of panties in front of Ross] Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?",rachel
925," [visibly nervous] Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.",ross
926," [to Joey] He is so cute. [to Angela and Bob] So, where did you guys grow up?",monica
927," How, how did that happen?",monica
928, Oh my god.,joey
929, What?,monica
930, I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.,joey
931," So, you and Angela, huh?",joey
932," You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.",joey
933," Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.",joey
934," Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.",joey
935," I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.",monica
936," It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.",monica
937, Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.,monica
938," Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.",phoebe
939," Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.",chandler
940," Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.",rachel
941," That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? [the buzzer on the washer goes off] I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...[opens up the washer] Uh-oh.",ross
942, What uh-oh?,rachel
943," [not wanting to tell her] Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. [singing] Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.",ross
944," Ross, what's the matter?",rachel
945," Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.",ross
946," Come on, show me.",rachel
947," All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.",ross
948," Oh, everything's pink.",rachel
949," Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.",ross
950," Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!",rachel
951," Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?",monica
952, Oh my god.,monica
953, What?,joey
954, Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.,monica
955," Come on, they're close.",joey
956, Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.,monica
957," Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.",joey
958," Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's--not really true, is it?",monica
959," Well, who's to say what's true? I mean--",joey
960," Oh my god, what were you thinking?",monica
961," All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.",joey
962, [hits him lightly] Oh!,monica
963, Ow!,joey
964, [leaving] I'm outta here.,monica
965," Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.",joey
966, Really?,monica
967," Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.",joey
968," I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.",monica
969," Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.",joey
970," Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, [Chandler flails his hand out and hits Janice in the eye]... boom.",chandler
971," Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?",chandler
972, Oh my god. [Chandler downs another espresso.] How many of those have you had?,phoebe
973," Oh, I don't know, a million?",chandler
974," Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.",phoebe
975, I'm fine.,chandler
976, All right.,phoebe
977, I'm not fine. Here she comes.,chandler
978, Wait here. Breathe.,phoebe
979, How do you do that?,chandler
980, It's like a gift.,phoebe
981, We should always always break up together.,chandler
982," Oh, I'd like that.",phoebe
983, You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.,ross
984," Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.",rachel
985," Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.",rachel
986," I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.",rachel
987," Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!",rachel
988," All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!",rachel
989, [to Ross] Yes! Did you see that?,rachel
990," You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.",ross
991, I could not have done this without you.,rachel
992," Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? [Ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.] I'm fine, I'm fine.",ross
993, Are you sure?,rachel
994, No.,ross
995," Oh, are you sure you're ok?",rachel
996, Yeah.,ross
997, Does it still hurt?,rachel
998, Yeah.,ross
999, [seeing Rachel's clothes] What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.,phoebe
1000, Hi.,monica
1001," Hey, how'd it go?",phoebe
1002, Excellent.,joey
1003," We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.",monica
1004," What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.",ross
1005," [notices his head] Oh, I'm sorry.",monica
1006, Where's Chandler?,rachel
1007," Oh, he needed some time to grieve.",phoebe
1008, I'm free! I'm free!,chandler

1090," Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.",ross
1091, Why not?,monica
1092, Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.,ross
1093, I could do that.,monica
1094," Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.",rachel
1095, Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.,monica
1096," Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...",chandler

1128," Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?",rachel
1129," No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? ",chandler
1130," Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that. ",monica

1136, I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...,joey
1137," God, I love these fingers...",chandler

1143," What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!",chandler
1144," I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?",chandler
1145," Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?",chandler
1146," Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.",chandler

1149, Lose the other guys.,chandler
1150," C'mon, we're great together, why not?",chandler
1151," ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'",chandler
1152," I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...",chandler
1153, ...The second guy.,chandler
1154," Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.",chandler

1157, Nope.,joey
1158," No? What happened, big guy?",ross
1159,  'Big guy'?,chandler
1160, It felt like a 'big guy' moment.,ross
1161, I got fired.,joey
1162," Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and-",joey
1163," Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.",rachel
1164, My mom will.,joey

1168," Yeah, I mean- I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it- feel like your shot..?",ross
1169," Hard to tell, I was naked.",joey
1170," No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.",phoebe

1176," Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. ",monica
1177, She is a kook.,ross
1178,"   If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!  ",monica
1179," Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.",rachel

1235," I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...",rachel
1236," Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.",ross
1237, Yeah right.,rachel
1238," It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.",ross

1264," Huh. [she agrees, but looks very confused]",rachel

1296," No, you are not. We tell you stuff.",monica
1297, Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. [Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased] Looks like I was second to last.,phoebe
1298, Hmmm... this is so nice.,rachel

1310, During a blackout? He'd get trampled!,rachel
1311, [nonchalantly] Yeah?,ross
1312," You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. [Jill gives him a stick of gum, and a strange look] 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.",chandler
1313," [stops at a door] Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?",phoebe
1314," Oh. [they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers] Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.",rachel
1315, [trying to hold back the struggling cat] He seems to hate you. Are you sure?,phoebe
1316, Wait a minute. What's his name?,phoebe
1317, Bob Buttons?,rachel
1318, [the cat runs away from her] Oooh! You are a very bad man!,phoebe

1334," That, that is funny... [to Joey].... and Rachel keeps touching him.",ross
1335, Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.,phoebe
1336," Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.",rachel
1337, Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.,phoebe
1338," Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.",rachel
1339, [smiling] You betcha!,phoebe
1340," [chewing gum] Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.",chandler
1341," Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. [Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth.]",chandler
1342," Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... [grimacing] ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.",chandler

1349," If you want, I'll do it.",monica
1350," I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. [Rachel looks at her] But I won't.",phoebe
1351," God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.",rachel
1352," You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... [they stare at her]... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.",phoebe
1353," Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....",rachel
1354, Paolo. Hi.,ross
1355," Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.",ross
1356," Thing, yes. Thing.",ross
1357," No, no, no. Technically the... s*x is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...",ross
1358," No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.",ross
1359, Yeah! Se vice?,ross
1360, So you do know a little English.,ross

1362," That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!",ross
1363, OK.,chandler
1364," Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... [time lapse]... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... [someone blows it out, the room gets completely dark]",phoebe

1373," Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.",chandler
1374, Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?,chandler

1376, Yes please.,chandler
1377, He's a he?,chandler
1378," ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?",chandler
1379," Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be... ",rachel
1380, You did?,chandler
1381," Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.",rachel
1382," Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?",chandler
1383, I did.,monica
1384," Yeah, I think so, yeah.",phoebe
1385, Not me.,joey
1386," Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.",ross
1387, You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?,chandler
1388," No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...",ross
1389," Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?",chandler
1390," I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...",phoebe
1391," Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?",chandler
1392, WHAT IS IT?!,chandler
1393," Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.",monica

1395," Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. ",monica
1396," Oh my God! Calling from Rome! [Takes phone] Bon giorno, caro mio. ",rachel
1397, [To Joey] So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.,ross

1400," So, uh, how's she doing?",ross
1401," How-how are you, Mom?",monica
1402, What?,monica
1403, Nothing.,monica
1404," She is unbelievable, our mother is...",monica
1405," Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.",ross
1406, Oh God!,monica
1407, The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. ,monica
1408," Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.",ross
1409, She looks so small. ,ross
1410, I know.,monica
1411," Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now. ",ross
1412," G'bye, Nana. [She kisses her on the forehead]",monica
1413," Bye, Nana. ",ross
1414, Ross!,monica
1415," Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..",ross

1417," I, uh, I'll go see. [He goes in]",ross
1418, Now she's passed.,ross
1419," I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?",chandler

1421," Yeah, you have homosexual hair.",phoebe
1422," So, um, did she...",rachel
1423, Twice.,ross
1424, Twice?,joey

1426, You guys okay?,joey
1427," I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...",ross
1428, Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.,phoebe
1429," Nono, she's gone.",ross
1430, We checked. A lot.,monica
1431," Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? [She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously] Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.",phoebe
1432," Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? [Gives her a pencil]",rachel
1433, Thanks!,phoebe
1434, Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.,rachel
1435," Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! [Realises his tactlessness] ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?",joey
1436," Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. [Hands back the pencil]",phoebe
1437, I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.,ross
1438, [Sarcastic] I don't see why not.,ross
1439, Here's my retainer!,ross
1440, Dad!,monica
1441, You what?,monica
1442, Define fun.,monica
1443," ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.",monica
1444, That's probably what they'll say.,monica
1445," Hey, gorgeous.",chandler
1446," No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.",chandler
1447," So, uh... what do you think it is about me?",chandler
1448," ...Quality, right, great.",chandler
1449," Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?",chandler
1450," Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.",chandler
1451," No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.",chandler
1452, Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.,chandler
1453, [Holding a dress out from inside the closet] This one?,ross
1454," I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.",ross
1455, Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. [Starts to climb over the furniture],ross
1456," Okay. Um, how about these? [Holds out a pair]",ross
1457, And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?,ross
1458," [Forages around] Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.",ross
1459," No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.",ross
1460, Oh my God..,ross
1461," Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.",ross
1462," [Entering] How we doing, you guys ready?",ross
1463, Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?,monica
1464, Some days it's all I can think about. ,ross
1465," [Entering] Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.",phoebe
1466," Oh, you-you mean your earrings?",rachel
1467, What'd I say?,phoebe
1468, [Sticking her foot out]Hm-m.,rachel
1469, Are these the shoes?,monica
1470, Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.,rachel
1471," What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?",ross
1472, [Entering with Chandler] Morning. We ready to go?,joey
1473," Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?",chandler
1474, It was a really beautiful service.,monica
1475, What?,joey
1476," Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.",chandler
1477," Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. [He has a pocket TV]",joey
1478, You're watching a football game at a funeral?,chandler
1479," No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.",joey
1480," You are a frightening, frightening man.",chandler
1481, Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!,rachel
1482," Oh, I hope they're not ruined.",ross
1483," God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!",phoebe
1484," I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- [Not looking where he is going he falls into an open grave]",ross
1485, I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...,ross
1486," Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.",phoebe
1487," What, what is it?",ross
1488, You missed a belt loop. ,phoebe
1489, Oh! No-n-,ross
1490," Okay, it's in spasm.",phoebe
1491," Oh, no-",chandler
1492," Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.",chandler

1494," I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.",ross
1495," Wow, those pills really worked, huh?",monica

1508," [Still trapped under Ross] Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?",rachel
1509," Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.",monica
1510, That sounds like Nana.,monica
1511, ...I can imagine.,monica
1512," That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?",monica
1513," How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.",monica
1514, Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?,monica
1515, Huh.,monica
1516," Oh, I think so.",monica
1517, Thank you. They're yours.,monica
1518," Hey, who's this little naked guy?",rachel
1519, That little naked guy would be me.,ross
1520," Aww, look at the little thing.",rachel

1536, He is?,chandler
1537," Out of my league. I could get a Brian. [Brian enters behind him] If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. [Sees him] Hey, Brian.",chandler
1538," Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?",rachel
1539," It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.",rachel
1540," Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?  Oh, look at that.",rachel

1542," Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.",rachel
1543," Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?",monica

1550,  I'm calling Mom.,ross
1551," Hey, hey.",joey
1552, Hey.,chandler
1553, Hey.,phoebe
1554, And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?,chandler
1555," Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.",joey
1556," That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.",chandler
1557, What were you modeling for?,phoebe
1558, You know those posters for the city free clinic?,joey
1559," Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those ""healthy, healthy, healthy guys""?",monica
1560," You know, the asthma guy was really cute.",phoebe
1561, Do you know which one you're gonna be?,chandler

1567, Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?,ross
1568," You know, they're not actually supposed to have...  I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?",monica
1569, Yeah.,joey
1570," And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.",monica
1571," Yes, every single one of them.",chandler
1572," Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?",monica
1573," Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.",phoebe
1574," So you're free Thursday, then.",monica
1575," Yeah. Oh, can I come?",phoebe
1576," Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?",monica
1577," Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.",rachel
1578, I thought it was $98.50.,chandler
1579," Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.",rachel
1580," Well, I'm off to Carol's.",ross
1581," Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?",phoebe
1582,"  Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.",ross
1583," Hi, is uh, is Carol here?",ross
1584," Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.",ross

1586, Kinda like a big face without skin.,ross
1587," Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.",ross
1588,"  Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.",ross
1589," The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?",ross
1590," You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?",ross
1591," Do you uh, do you talk about me?",ross
1592, Really?,ross
1593," Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.",ross
1594," Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.",phoebe
1595," I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.",chandler
1596," Hey, Rach, did you make your money?",monica
1597," No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.",rachel
1598," Rach, here's your mail.",monica
1599," Thanks, you can just put it on the table.",rachel
1600,"  No, here's your mail.",monica

1610," All right, I'm nine years old.",chandler
1611," Oh, I hate this story.",ross

1613, Oh my god.,rachel
1614, Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.,chandler
1615," Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.",joey
1616," Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.  Aramis? Aramis?",joey

1626," No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.",phoebe
1627, Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.,joey
1628," Tonight, on a very special Blossom.",chandler
1629," Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.  What?",monica
1630, I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.,ross
1631," All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.",monica
1632, That's closer.,ross
1633," I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.",rachel

1635," Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.",rachel
1636," Chandler, will you just come in already?",joey
1637," No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.",chandler
1638," Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!",phoebe

1640," Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.",joey
1641, That's not a question.,monica
1642," But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.",joey
1643," All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.",monica

1650, Why would we do that?,monica
1651," Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.",phoebe
1652," Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.",monica
1653," Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!",rachel
1654, The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.,chandler
1655, The balloon?,joey
1656," No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?",chandler
1657," I can't, I gotta go.",rachel

1666," Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.",phoebe
1667," Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?",monica
1668, We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.,rachel
1669, No I don't.,monica
1670," Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys.""",rachel

1676," Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.",joey
1677," Well then get it, get it!",monica
1678, That tone will not make me go any faster.,joey
1679,  Joey!,monica
1680, That one will.,joey
1681," And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.",ross
1682," Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?",ross
1683," Shh!  Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey!  Hey, uh, did you just feel that?",ross
1684," Does it always, uh--?",ross

1689," Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.",joey
1690, Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?,monica
1691,  For an emergency just like this.,chandler
1692,"  All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this  right now. But I'm not.",rachel
1693, I swear you said you had the keys.,monica
1694," No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.",rachel
1695," Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.",phoebe
1696, Why would I have the keys?,monica
1697, Aside from the fact that you said you had them?,rachel
1698, But I didn't.,monica
1699," Well, you should have.",rachel
1700, Why?,monica
1701, Because!,rachel
1702, Why?,monica
1703, Because!,rachel
1704," Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no!  Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...",monica
1705," Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.",chandler
1706," Well, the turkey's burnt.  Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.",monica
1707," Here we come, walkin' down the—this doesn't smell like Mom's.",ross
1708," No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross?  Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.",monica
1709," Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.",rachel
1710," Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.",joey
1711," Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?",monica
1712, You call that delicious?,joey
1713," Stop it, stop it, stop it!",monica
1714, Now this feels like Thanksgiving.,chandler
1715, Ooh.,phoebe
1716, What?,rachel

1727," Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.",phoebe
1728, Make a wish?,monica
1729," Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?",phoebe
1730, The bigger half.,joey
1731," I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.",chandler
1732," And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.",ross
1733, And a crappy New Year.,rachel
1734," Here, here!",chandler
1735, Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. ,ross
1736, W-wait. What is that?,monica
1737, 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?,ross
1738," No, no, I don't.",monica
1739," Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?",rachel
1740, My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.,ross
1741, That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?,phoebe
1742," Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!",chandler
1743," Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?",monica
1744," Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...",ross
1745, Why don't you just get a roommate?,monica
1746," Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- [Realises] ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.",ross
1747," So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.",phoebe
1748, Might wanna open with the snowman.,chandler
1749," So, how'd it go?",monica
1750," Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.",joey
1751, How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.,ross
1752," I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.",joey
1753, So what are you gonna be?,monica
1754," Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?",joey
1755," Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? [They all protest and hit her with cushions] Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?",rachel
1756," Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!",chandler
1757," Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. ",rachel
1758," Yeah, you wish!",phoebe
1759," It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.",chandler
1760," Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. ",chandler
1761," Phoebe, you're on.",rachel
1762," Oh, oh, good.",phoebe
1763," [Into microphone] Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!",rachel
1764," [Takes mike] Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. [Shakes bell as an introduction] [Sung:]",phoebe
1765, [Sung],phoebe
1766, [Sung],phoebe
1767," Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!",phoebe
1768," [Quietly, to the others] That guy's going home with a note!",chandler
1769, Could you speak up please?,phoebe
1770," Okay, we're gonna take a short break. [Goes over to their table]",phoebe
1771," Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!",joey
1772," Come here, Marcel. Sit here. [Marcel wanders off]",ross
1773," Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?",rachel
1774, Just a smidge.,ross
1775," David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.",phoebe
1776, I think it's romantic.,monica
1777, Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?,phoebe
1778, Yeah!,rachel
1779," Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... ",phoebe
1780," Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.",chandler
1781," No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?",phoebe
1782," Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.",chandler
1783, What?!,monica
1784," C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! ",ross
1785," I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.",chandler
1786," Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!",monica
1787," I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!",chandler
1788," Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.",joey
1789, Too many jokes... must mock Joey! ,chandler
1790," Nice shoes, huh? [He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle]",joey
1791," Aah, y'killing me!",chandler
1792, Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!,monica
1793," Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?",ross
1794, Do you always have to bring him here?,monica
1795," I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...",ross
1796," Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.",chandler
1797," Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.",ross
1798," Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.",chandler
1799," Okay, alright, I have a question, then. ",phoebe
1800," Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?",phoebe
1801, Sure.,phoebe
1802," Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.",phoebe
1803," Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me. ",phoebe
1804," Oh yeah, right now.",phoebe
1805," Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. ",phoebe
1806, I can hop. [She hops onto the table],phoebe
1807, So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?,ross
1808," I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.",monica
1809, Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?,chandler

1825," Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.",ross
1826, What's the matter?,monica
1827," Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands... ",ross

1856, Par-tay! ,ross
1857, That thing is not coming in here.,monica
1858," 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?",ross
1859, I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.,monica
1860, Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...,ross
1861, Alright. Just keep him away from me.,monica

1866," No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? [To Monica] Are people eating my dip?",rachel
1867," Wow, that's, uh, dirty.",joey

1882," Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. [He does so] And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.",phoebe
1883, And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. [They kiss] I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.,phoebe
1884," There y'go, kids.",joey

1901, Alrightalrightalright. [Kisses him. Ross takes a photo] There.,joey
1902," [Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel] I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.",ross
1903, ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.,rachel
1904, Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?,phoebe
1905, Why?,monica

1924," Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.",phoebe
1925," Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!",monica

1927, I wish all guys could be like him.,monica
1928, I know.,phoebe

1940," C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.",ross
1941, You can say that because she's not your mom.,chandler

2300," I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...",phoebe
2301, We should get over there and see if she's okay.  Just one...second! Score!  Game! Come on. ,monica
2302,"  Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.",ross
2303," No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.",joey
2304," Come on, two on one.",ross
2305," What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!",chandler
2306," What, now?",ross
2307," Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!",joey
2308," My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! ",chandler
2309,  How's it going?,ross
2310," Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, ""How could you?"" or, ""Enormous breasts!"" Here he comes!",monica
2311, Ooh!,phoebe
2312," Oh, ok bye-bye.",phoebe
2313," Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel,  but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.",monica
2314," Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say... ",ross
2315," Oh, just look at her... ",phoebe
2316," Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...",ross
2317," Oh, you're right.",monica
2318,  ...and I really think it should be me.,ross
2319, Hey.,ross
2320, Hey.,rachel
2321, You all right?,ross
2322," Ooh, I've been better...",rachel
2323," Come here.  Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.",ross
2324," Oh, Ross...",rachel
2325, What?,ross
2326," I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. ",rachel
2327, Huh.,ross
2328," Oh Ross, you're so great!",rachel
2329, Ohhhh ,ross
2330," Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?",monica
2331, Oh...,rachel
2332, You ok?,phoebe
2333, ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?,rachel
2334, Yep!,phoebe
2335," See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.",ross
2336," No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want",rachel
2337," Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.",ross
2338," No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.",rachel
2339,  What?,ross
2340, What?,rachel
2341," I-I'm, I'm having a boy?",ross
2342," Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.",rachel
2343," Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy!  Huh, am I having a boy?",ross
2344," I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!",ross
2345, Wha-,chandler
2346, Wha-,joey
2347, I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!,ross
2348, Hey!,joey
2349, Hey!,chandler
2350, I'm having a son. Um...,ross
2351, Yes! And that would be a shut-down!,monica
2352," Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!",monica
2353," Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!",joey
2354," Yeah, get out!",chandler
2355," You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies!  All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going,  and I'm gone.",monica
2356,  One more game?,chandler
2357, Oh yeah!,joey
2358," That is IT! You just barge in here, you don't knock-",rachel
2359, I'm sorry!,chandler
2360, -You have no respect for anybody's privacy-,rachel
2361," Rachel, wait, wait.",chandler
2362," No, you wait! This is ridiculous!",rachel
2363, Can I just say one thing?,chandler
2364, What? What?!,rachel
2365, That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.,chandler
2366, Oh!!,rachel
2367," Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.",phoebe
2368, Oops!,phoebe
2369," Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.",phoebe
2370, Isn't he great?,phoebe
2371, He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.,rachel
2372," I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?",phoebe
2373," So, you think you'll do it on his couch?",monica
2374," Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.",phoebe
2375," Okaaay. [To the guys, on the couch] Any of you guys want anything else?",rachel
2376," Oh, yes, could I have one of those-",chandler
2377," No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?",rachel
2378, Okay.,chandler
2379," No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.",chandler
2380, You what? Wh- what were you doing seeing her boobies?,ross
2381, It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.,chandler
2382," Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?",rachel
2383," Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.",phoebe
2384," Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.",rachel
2385," Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.",chandler
2386," Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.",rachel
2387," Okaaay, [Gestures] rock, hard place, me.",chandler
2388," Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?",chandler
2389, Huh.,chandler
2390," Uh-huh, how did you know that?",chandler
2391," Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?",joey
2392," Hey, how long are you in the city?",monica
2393," Oh, this is my friend Roger.",phoebe
2394," Dad, dad. [Shakes his head]",joey
2395," [Snatches the phone] Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? [To his dad] Did you know this isn't Ma?",joey
2396, Sure. So how long you been... [Goes back to chopping],joey
2397, Since then?!,joey
2398, ...I d'know.,joey
2399, You're one to talk. [Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan],joey
2400, Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.,joey
2401," It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the CIA. [Considers] That'd be cool.... This blows!",joey
2402," I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? [She walks over near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest] Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... [Notices Chandler] Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?",rachel
2403, [Without looking up] What? [Looks up] What?,chandler
2404, Did you not get a good enough look the other day?,rachel
2405," Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your pee-pee.",ross
2406," Y'know, I don't see that happening?",chandler
2407," C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.",rachel
2408, Well I'm not showing you my 'tat'.,chandler
2409, Hello?,monica
2410,  It's Phoebe.,phoebe
2411, C'mon up.,monica
2412," [Sarcastic] Oh, good. Rog is here.",chandler
2413, What's the matter with Rog?,joey
2414, Yeah.,ross
2415," Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.",chandler
2416," What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.",ross
2417," Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level that-that she was a lesbian?",ross
2418, Why? Why would I- why? Why? Why? Why?,ross
2419," Waitwait, go back to that sibling thing.",monica
2420, That- that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!,ross
2421, Oh! So you think I'm a failure!,monica
2422, Isn't he good?,phoebe
2423," Nonono, that-that's not what I was saying...",ross
2424," Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!",monica
2425," Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!",ross
2426," You're right! I mean- you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and- and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. ",rachel
2427," Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?",phoebe
2428," Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.",phoebe
2429, You're welcome.,monica
2430, Hate that guy! [Throws another cookie],monica
2431," Night, you guys.",joey
2432," Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.",chandler
2433," Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?",joey
2434, I'm Joey Tribbiani.,joey
2435," Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?",chandler
2436," Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.",chandler
2437," Dad, Ronni's here.",joey
2438," So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?",chandler
2439, Whoah-ho.,joey
2440, No you won't.,joey
2441, If you go to a hotel you'll be.. doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.,joey
2442," That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.",joey
2443," Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni- uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.",joey
2444," C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by 'No thanks, it's late'. ",chandler
2445," Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.",joey
2446," Well, either you break it off with Ronni-",joey
2447, Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!,joey
2448, I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!,joey
2449," Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?",chandler
2450, Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear. ,joey
2451," Well, you're gonna.",chandler
2452," I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...",joey
2453," Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?",chandler
2454," Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...",joey
2455," Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?",chandler
2456, No.,joey
2457," No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say- 'No thanks, I'm married'.",chandler
2458, You really think so?,joey
2459, Yeah. I really do.,chandler
2460," Thanks, Chandler. [Snuggles up to him]",joey
2461, Get off!,chandler
2462, Hi...May I help you?,monica
2463, Okay...who are you?,monica
2464," Oh, c'mon in.",monica
2465," Hi, I'm Rachel.",rachel
2466, Bathroom's up there.,rachel
2467," Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?",rachel
2468," Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's pee-pee time. [She goes into Joey and Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Trib is reading the paper] Hey, Mr. Trib. ",rachel
2469, Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.,rachel
2470, [Runs out in a towel] What's the matter with you?!,joey
2471, I thought it was Chandler!,rachel
2472, [Comes out of his room] What? What?,chandler
2473, You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!,rachel
2474," Sorry, my- my thing was in there with me.",chandler
2475, Hey. ,phoebe
2476, How's it going?,monica
2477, Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.,phoebe
2478, So what's going on?,phoebe
2479," Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. ",monica
2480," I dunno, there's just something about...",ross
2481, Basically we just feel that he's...,chandler
2482, We hate that guy.,rachel
2483," We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.",ross
2484,"Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?",phoebe
2485, We're sorry.,rachel
2486, Ma! What're you doing here?,joey
2487, Oww! Big ring!,joey
2488," Hold on, you-you knew?",joey
2489," So then- how could you- I mean, how could you?!-",joey
2490," Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?",joey
2491, I'm...happy...for you?,joey
2492," Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.",joey
2493, Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.,joey
2494, With this ring? No contest.,joey
2495," Nothing, nothing.",phoebe
2496," It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.",phoebe
2497, But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...,phoebe
2498, Intense and creepy. ,phoebe
2499," But I don't. Me, Phoebe.",phoebe
2500," You're not? See, that's why you're so great! ",phoebe
2501," So you talked to your dad, huh.",monica
2502," Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.",joey
2503, Wow.,rachel
2504, Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.,chandler
2505," So Joey, you okay?",ross
2506," Yeah, I guess. It's just- parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.",joey
2507," Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.",rachel
2508," If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.",chandler
2509, Hey.,phoebe
2510, How's it going?,monica
2511," Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.",phoebe
2512," Yeah, right.",phoebe
2513, What happened?,rachel
2514," I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!",phoebe
2515," Hey, Joey. What's going on?",phoebe
2516," Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. [He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by Monica in a towel]",joey
2517, Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!,monica
2518, Sorry. Wrong boobies.,joey
2519," Hello, Joey.",monica
2520," I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.",joey
2521, She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.,ross
2522, Any contact?,chandler
2523, She lent me an egg once.,ross
2524, You're in!,joey
2525," Aw, right.",ross
2526, Hey. [stutters something incoherent],ross
2527," Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian--I don't think we need a third...",chandler
2528," Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.",joey
2529, An egg?,ross
2530," Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, ""Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg.""",joey
2531, I think it's winning.,chandler
2532, I think it's insane.,ross
2533," She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.",chandler
2534, Think it'll work?,joey
2535," No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.",chandler
2536, You can not do this.,monica
2537," Do what, do what?",rachel
2538, Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.,monica
2539, No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?,rachel
2540," 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!",phoebe
2541," But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.",monica
2542," Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?",rachel
2543," Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.",joey
2544," Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...",chandler
2545," No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.",joey
2546," Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a--",chandler
2547," Pathetic mess? I know, but--come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! [Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and eats it.] Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.",joey
2548, Hi. She said yes.,ross
2549," Yes! Way to go, man! [Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.] Still got the egg, huh?",chandler
2550, [Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife] How do I look?,joey
2551," Oh, uh, I... don't... care. [Joey's date shows up] Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.",chandler
2552, ...And what did you bring?,chandler
2553, Janice?,chandler
2554," [angrily] Hey, it's Janice.",chandler
2555," Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.",chandler
2556," No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down. CHANDLER: Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!",joey
2557," [at the urinal] Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.",joey
2558," I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. [gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear] Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!",chandler
2559," Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.",rachel
2560, Which one was Pete Carney?,monica
2561," Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had s*x. [imitating] ""Was it good for you?""",rachel
2562," Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-""I-win""-guy. [imitating] ""I win! I win!"" I went out with the guy for two months--I didn't get to win once.",monica
2563, How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!,rachel
2564, I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.,monica
2565, I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.,phoebe
2566," There's more beer, right?",monica
2567," Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.",phoebe
2568," Phoebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.",rachel
2569," Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.",phoebe
2570," Ok, well, what kind of ritual?",monica
2571," Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.",phoebe
2572, Or?,rachel
2573," Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.",phoebe
2574, Burning's good.,monica
2575," Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.",rachel
2576," Good for you. [jumps suddenly] Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?",joey
2577, That's OK.,chandler
2578, [to Lorraine] We can't do that.,joey
2579, [disgusted] What? What can't you do?,chandler
2580," Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?",joey
2581," Uh, we might be leaving now.",joey
2582," Tell me it's ""you and me"" we.",chandler
2583," She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.",joey
2584," Ok, you can not do this to me.",chandler
2585," You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.",joey
2586," I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.",joey
2587, I hope she throws up on you.,chandler
2588, So...,chandler
2589," Oh, what a crappy night!",chandler
2590," Excuse me. [gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him] How ya doin'?",chandler
2591, Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?,chandler
2592," You got it. Good woman! [the waiter turns around, it's a man] Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?",chandler
2593," That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. [to Janice] I've always wanted to know...",chandler
2594," No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.",chandler
2595," Oh, Chandler, sorry.",monica

2597," Ok, well, this was very special.",chandler
2598," Rache, come see who's out here!",monica

2600, Janice is gonna go away now.,chandler
2601, I'll be right back.,monica

2604," Oh, good, Joey's home now.",chandler
2605," Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. [to Chandler] He just happened to call.",monica
2606," I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.",ross
2607," The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.",ross
2608, If you wanna put a label on it.,ross
2609," Nope, nope, that's it.",ross
2610," Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. [to Carol and Susan] Helloo!",ross
2611," Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.",phoebe
2612," All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.",monica
2613," Um, that's ok! [throws it in fire] Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.",phoebe
2614," Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.",rachel
2615, Can we just start throwing things in?,monica
2616," Ok, yeah, ok. [she throws the directions in] Oh, OK.",phoebe

2631, Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?,ross
2632," Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin.

2642," You did so. I swear, I swear--[noticing Kristin's absence] How long has she been in the bathroom?",ross
2643, Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.,ross
2644," Oh, god. [He puts his head down on the grill] You know, this is still pretty hot. [He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off and eats it.]",ross
2645," No, it's just...you know the whole ""getting on with your life"" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.",ross

2657," Hey guys, guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...",phoebe
2658, Hey!,chandler
2659, Never mind. But it was going to be really good.,phoebe

2662, So.... I quit.,chandler
2663, Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!,chandler
2664," Uh, Chandler... you've been there for five years.",monica
2665," If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.",chandler
2666, So was it a lot more money?,phoebe
2667, It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.,chandler
2668, ... the WENUS?,rachel
2669, Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.,chandler
2670, [sarcastic] Oh. That WENUS.,rachel
2671, So what're you going to do?,joey
2672, I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.,chandler

2674, Um... hi there.,monica
2675," Hi! [turns back to Chandler, then to Monica] Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....",phoebe
2676, Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.,chandler
2677," Yeah, yeah! Well, what kind of food is he looking for?",monica
2678," Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.",phoebe
2679, [excited] Oh my God!,monica
2680," Yeah, I know! [turns to Chandler] Well, what do you think?",phoebe
2681," Thanks, Phoeb. But I just don't see myself in a big white hat.",chandler
2682, OK. [pause] Hey Monica! Guess what!,phoebe
2683, Can you see my nipples through this shirt?,chandler
2684," No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.",rachel
2685," Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?",phoebe
2686," Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. [pause] I added the ""a-gogo"".",chandler
2687, Work counselor?,rachel
2688," Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.",chandler
2689, I don't!,rachel
2690," Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.",chandler
2691," Ah, the lesser-known ""I don't have a dream"" speech.",ross
2692," Oh, I love my life, I love my life!",monica
2693, Ooh! Brian's Song!,phoebe
2694, The meeting with the guy went great?,rachel
2695," So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.",monica
2696, Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?,chandler
2697," So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.",monica
2698, What are you going to make?,rachel
2699, [as though Rachel wasn't paying attention] Yummy noises.,phoebe
2700," [pause] And Monica, what are you going to make?",rachel
2701, I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!,monica
2702," Ooh! I know what you could make! [runs over to join Monica and Rachel in the kitchen] I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know. [sits down]",phoebe
2703," Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?",ross
2704," How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.",joey
2705," OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?",ross
2706, Who are you going out with?,chandler
2707," Oh, is this the bug lady?",phoebe
2708," [trying to sound like a bug] Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.",rachel
2709, Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.,ross
2710, So what are you guys going to do?,rachel
2711," Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I might introduce her to my monkey.",ross
2712, And he's not speaking metaphorically.,chandler
2713," [aside to Ross] So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... [gestures with hands, back and forth] huh-huh?",joey
2714," Well, I don't know.... [gestures] huh-huh.... but I'm hoping [gestures] huh-huh.",ross
2715," I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.",joey
2716," He's not going to hurt you! Keep going, Celia. Marcel...",ross
2717, Alright... [lifts Marcel away],ross
2718," [to Joey] OK, try this salmon mousse.",monica
2719, [tasting] Mmmm. Good.,joey
2720, Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,monica
2721, It's creamier.,joey
2722," Yeah, well, is that better?",monica
2723," I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?",joey
2724, My God! What happened to you?,rachel
2725," Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? [he taps the results and reads them] ""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.""",chandler
2726, That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!,phoebe
2727," Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing... something.",chandler
2728," [comes up and rubs him on the chest] Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!",rachel
2729," [brings a plate of tiny appetizers over] Hey, maybe this'll cheer you up.",monica
2730," Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.",chandler
2731, It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.,monica
2732, [tastes it] Well.... it is amouz-ing...,chandler
2733," [on phone] Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye. [hangs up]",monica
2734, Ten dollars an hour for what?,rachel
2735," Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.",monica
2736, [hurt] Waitressing?,rachel
2737, Uh-oh.,joey
2738, Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...,monica
2739," But, but?",rachel
2740," But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.",monica
2741, Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.,rachel
2742," You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. [dead silence] Amouz-bouche? [holds out tray]",chandler
2743," OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...",ross
2744," [embarrassed] Wha... what, here?",ross
2745, Ah....,ross
2746, [panicked] Er.... um.....,ross
2747, Um... uh.... vulva.,ross
2748, [in disbelief] Vulva?,joey
2749," Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.",ross
2750, [sarcastic] Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??,joey
2751," Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?",ross
2752, What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.,joey
2753, [deadpan] Please be kidding.,ross
2754, Why not? Come on! Close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.,joey
2755, OK. [closes eyes] I'm in my apartment...,ross
2756, ....yeah... what else?,joey
2757," That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. [gets up, walks across room]",ross

2763, I... ahem... I really don't think so.,ross
2764," Come on! You like this woman, right?",joey
2765, Yeah.,ross
2766," You want to see her again, right?",joey
2767, Sure.,ross
2768," Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!",joey
2769," OK, turn around. [Joey looks taken aback] I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.",ross
2770," [turning around] Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.",joey

2781," Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.",joey
2782, Again?,chandler
2783," And again, and again, and again... [phone rings, he answers] Hello? [hands phone to Chandler] And again.",joey
2784," [on phone] Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?... Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?... Well, that's very generous... er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?... Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection!.... No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday! [slams the phone down]",chandler

2836," Oh, I was unbelievable.",ross
2837," All right, Ross!",joey
2838," I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were different characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.",ross
2839, Whoa! And the... [gestures with hands] huh-huh?,joey

2976," Knit, good woman, knit, knit!",chandler
2977, And that's the Chrysler building right there.,chandler
2978," Yes, yes she is. Didn't I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, uh, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Fl---, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan, and uh, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly. In fact, he uh, mentioned the word ""frenzy"".",chandler
2979," Oh, no, no. Nina--she is whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.",chandler
2980," And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself or others.",chandler
2981," Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir.",chandler

2996," Uh, sure, Nina. What's up?",chandler
2997," Oh, well, uh, maybe that's because they're uh, jealous of us.",chandler

3002," Well, I ended up telling her everything.",chandler
3003," Oh, how'd she take it?",rachel

3010," Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I'm not saying she's like evil or anything. She just, you know, she's always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. Oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like, have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?",phoebe
3011," Well, but that's what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then broke his heart, and then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore. Because he said he didn't wanna be around anything that looked like either one of us. I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but--",phoebe
3012, You're not gonna lose him.,chandler
3013," Come on, you gotta talk to Joey.",monica
3014, Yeah.,phoebe

3031," Why, how much is this gonna cost?",rachel
3032," I have no idea, but x-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.",monica
3033, Well what are we gonna do?,rachel
3034, There's not much we can do.,monica
3035," Um, unless, unless I use yours.",rachel
3036, No no no no no no no no no.,monica
3037," Well, now, wait a second. Who did I just put as my ""In case of emergency"" call person?",rachel
3038, That's insurance fraud.,monica

3045, I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.,ross

3049, What are you crazy? That's a baby!,chandler
3050, He should take the sack?,joey
3051," Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield, and I realize that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See, I am so not ready to be a father.",ross
3052," Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.",chandler
3053," Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking. Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?",joey

3063, And your friend Phoebe?,chandler
3064," Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?",joey
3065," Man if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.",chandler

3075," Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said yes.",rachel
3076," I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. I say we blow off the dates.",monica

3102, It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.,monica
3103, Would you stop being such a wuss?,rachel
3104," A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, ok?",monica

3157, And I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.,rachel
3158, I know. I'm just not that bright either.,rachel
3159," Ok, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father. Say your son never feels connected to you as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.",chandler
3160, Do you have a point?,ross

3561," I know, I know, I'm sorry-",rachel
3562," No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.",ross
3563," [Tearfully] Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- [Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it] Oh! Who is it?",rachel
3564, See? I've even called Animal Control!,rachel
3565, You called Animal Control?,ross
3566, Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?,rachel
3567," Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.",ross
3568," O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...",rachel
3569," That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!",ross
3570," Hi, thanks for coming.",rachel

3605," We can't, alright? [To the women] We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.",joey

3626," Ross, you don't know that.",rachel
3627," Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. [Kicks a sign in frustration] And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.",ross
3628," Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. [Kicks the sign] Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!",rachel
3629," Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!",ross
3630," Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.",rachel
3631," Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...",ross
3632, Ross.,rachel
3633," I don't even wanna hear it, you're just-",ross
3634, Ross.,rachel
3635," Oh, forget it, okay?",ross
3636, Ross!,rachel

3648," Oh, c'mon, Luisa!",rachel
3649," [To Rachel] You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.",ross
3650," Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!",rachel
3651," Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?",rachel
3652," It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. [Marcel resists] Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.",ross
3653," Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.",rachel

3657, That'd be good.,rachel
3658," Alright. [He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised] The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. [He sits down and starts to pour the wine] Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um-",ross
3659, Barry?!,rachel
3660, We have got to start locking that door!,ross
3661, This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?,monica
3662, Nope.,phoebe
3663, That's because I'm in front of them.,monica
3664, Eh. I thought that was an alp.,chandler
3665," Well, high school was not my favourite time.",monica
3666," I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and s*x.",joey
3667," Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any s*x I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.",chandler
3668," Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?",monica
3669, Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! [She stands up and starts to dance around] Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!,phoebe
3670, I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.,chandler
3671," No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.",joey
3672," I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.",ross
3673,  Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!,monica
3674, I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!,ross
3675," Oh, that is so sick.",rachel
3676, I feel violated. And not in a good way.,chandler
3677," How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!",phoebe
3678," I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...",chandler
3679, So have you called her yet?,monica
3680," Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem?  I'm right, right?",chandler
3681, I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.,monica
3682," Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!",phoebe
3683," Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.",chandler
3684, Her answer machine?,joey
3685," No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.",chandler
3686," So, uh, why didn't you say anything?",phoebe
3687," Oh, no no no no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase 'Yes indeedy-o'.",chandler
3688," Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!",monica
3689," Okay, okay, what's going on?",ross
3690," Okay, they're just talking...",phoebe
3691," Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?",ross
3692," No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!",phoebe
3693, What? What? What?!,ross
3694, That man across the street just kicked that pigeon!  Oh!,phoebe
3695,"  And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.",chandler
3696, Hey Rach!,chandler
3697, How'd it go?,monica
3698," Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...",rachel
3699, Not a good day for birds...,phoebe
3700," Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...",rachel
3701," That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?",ross
3702," Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!",rachel
3703," That's, that's nice twice!",ross
3704," Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?",monica
3705," Duh, where've you been?",joey
3706," Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?",rachel
3707, Yes!,chandler
3708, Why?,rachel
3709, I have my reasons.,chandler
3710," Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex- best friend?",monica
3711," All right. All right all right all right all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!",rachel
3712, Wow... Wow!,rachel
3713," I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.",rachel
3714," Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...",rachel
3715,"  Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye bye.  Oh God!",chandler
3716, THAT's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!,monica
3717," Hey, I've been honing!",chandler
3718, What was with the dishes?,ross
3719," Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",chandler
3720,"  Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!",monica
3721, Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!,phoebe
3722," Great, now he's waving back.",monica
3723," Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!",joey
3724, What kinda stuff..?,monica
3725," Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.",joey
3726, You cook naked?,phoebe
3727," Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.",joey
3728, What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.,chandler
3729," Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.",rachel

3737," Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.",monica
3738," Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?",chandler
3739, Maybe she never got your message.,joey
3740," Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.",phoebe
3741, Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...,chandler
3742," ...desperate, needy, pathetic?",ross
3743," Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.",chandler
3744, How many beeps?,phoebe
3745, She answered.,chandler
3746," Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.",monica
3747," I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.",chandler
3748, How'd he take it?,phoebe
3749," Pretty well, actually... ",rachel
3750,"  Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?",monica

3760," Please. If she said to you, ""Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now"", what would you say? ",rachel
3761," If it helps, I could slide over.",chandler
3762," It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.",ross
3763, Where are you going?,phoebe
3764,"  I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?",ross

3930, At the vet.,ross
3931," She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?",chandler
3932, She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.,ross

3934," She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.",ross
3935, So what does this mean?,chandler
3936, I'm gonna have to give him up.,ross
3937," I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!",joey

3940, Isn't there any way you can keep him?,joey
3941," No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin', he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.",ross
3942, How do you get a monkey into a zoo?,joey
3943," I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.",chandler
3944," Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.",ross
3945," Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.",chandler
3946," Hey. We found her, we found the girl.",phoebe
3947, What?,chandler
3948, Did you call the cops?,joey
3949, Nope. We took her to lunch.,rachel
3950, Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.,chandler
3951, What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.,ross
3952," Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this- with this amazing spirit.",monica
3953," Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.",ross
3954, ...Take off their hats!,chandler
3955, Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.,phoebe
3956, No way. No way did you do this.,rachel
3957, It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!,monica
3958, ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!,monica
3959," Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. [Exits]",rachel
3960, 'Scuse me?,monica

3963," Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.",monica
3964, Uh-huh.,monica
3965, Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.,monica
3966," [Reading letters] Oh God. [To Marcel] We didn't get into Scranton. [To the others] That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.",ross
3967, I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.,phoebe
3968," Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?",ross
3969," Oh, somebody will.",rachel
3970, You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?,joey
3971, You're kidding.,chandler
3972, Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!,joey
3973," Y'know, you'd think I would've.",chandler
3974, Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?,joey
3975, ...Flame Boy.,phoebe
3976, Where exactly is your zoo?,ross
3977, Yes.,ross
3978," Nono, he's, he's very docile.",ross
3979," Well I, I don't know. Why?",ross
3980," He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...",ross
3981, Why- why- why would he need a blade?,ross
3982," We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing-",joey

4529, [panicked] ahem... um... Crystal duck.,chandler
4530," No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?",rachel
4531, [stuttering incoherently] F-hah.... flennin....,chandler
4532, Oh.... my God.,rachel
4533," [rubbing his temples] Oh, no no no no no....",chandler
4534," [pats Chandler on the leg] That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.",joey
4535," I mean, this is unbelievable.",rachel
4536," I know. This is really, really huge.",phoebe
4537, No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.,chandler
4538, Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.,phoebe
4539," OK, is there a mute button on this woman?",chandler
4540," I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?",monica
4541," No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... [to Joey]: W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?",rachel
4542," Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.",joey
4543," Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. [gets up to leave]",rachel
4544, [quickly] H-He's in China!,chandler
4545, The country.,joey
4546," No, no, wait. [checks Ross's itinerary] His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.",monica
4547, What about the time difference?,chandler
4548, From here to the airport?,monica
4549, Yes! [Rachel walks towards door] You're never gonna make it!,chandler
4550," Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?",monica
4551, I-I-I don't know.,rachel
4552, Well then maybe you shouldn't go.,chandler
4553," He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.",joey
4554," Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.",monica
4555, I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.,rachel
4556," Here, look, alright, does this help?",phoebe
4557," Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later. [opens door]",rachel
4558," Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! [she leaves]",chandler
4559, [something in Chinese],ross
4560, Ni-chou chi-ma! [walks onto jetway],ross
4561," Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....",rachel
4562, Hi.,rachel
4563," Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.",rachel
4564," No, I know, but I--he just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...",rachel
4565," OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.",rachel
4566, Uh... I don't know.,rachel
4567," Heh, heh. It was nothin'.",joey
4568," [panicked] Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.",joey
4569, Sure! Why not?,joey
4570, How do you mean?,joey
4571," Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?",monica
4572," I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.",rachel
4573," I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.",rachel
4574," Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!",monica
4575," Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.",phoebe
4576, Another good point.,monica
4577," No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.",phoebe
4578, [confused] Huh?,rachel
4579," Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?",phoebe
4580, Why isn't it working out?,monica
4581, I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.,rachel
4582, Is he not cute enough for you?,monica
4583, No!,rachel
4584, Does he not make enough money?,monica
4585," No, I'm just....",rachel
4586, Maybe there's someone else.,phoebe
4587, Wha--,rachel
4588, Is there? Is there someone else?,monica
4589, No! There is.. there is noone else!,rachel
4590, Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?,monica
4591," Hey, big--",chandler
4592, Shhhh!,joey
4593, [quietly] --spender.,chandler
4594, She's still asleep.,joey
4595, So how'd it go?,chandler
4596," Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?",joey
4597, The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.,chandler
4598," Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!",joey
4599," Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.",chandler
4600," It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.",joey
4601, I didn't know you had another level.,chandler
4602, I know! Neither did I!,joey
4603," Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?",monica
4604, Yeah.,rachel
4605," Oh, from who?",monica
4606, From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.,rachel
4607," Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?",monica
4608," Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this--this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.",rachel
4609," Oh, why?",monica
4610," Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna--",rachel
4611," [gets up] No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!",monica
4612," Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...",rachel
4613," I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.",monica
4614, Who is it?,rachel
4615, C'mon up.,rachel
4616, Behind my brother's back? [Rachel glares at her] ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.,monica
4617, Seven hundred bucks!,joey
4618," Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?",chandler
4619," Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.",joey
4620," Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?",chandler
4621," What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? [Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.]",joey
4622, I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.,ross
4623," Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.",rachel
4624," Fine, just stop thinking about me.",ross
4625," Can't do it, can you?",ross
4626, So I'm thinking about you. So what?,rachel
4627," I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?",ross
4628, Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....,rachel
4629," Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.",ross
4630," Ross, it's too hard.",rachel
4631," No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.",ross
4632," Ross, you're like my best friend.",rachel
4633, I know.,ross
4634," If we broke up, and I lost you...",rachel
4635," Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?",ross
4636," Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?",rachel
4637," [pause] No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?",ross
4638," I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.",rachel
4639," Well, start looking.",ross
4640, Wow.,rachel
4641, Right! You're right!,rachel
4642, You know what?,rachel
4643," I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... [gives him her drink] I mean--I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.",rachel
4644," [sifting through crowd] Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.",rachel
4645," Oh, hey, hey, I got that.",ross
4646, No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.,ross
4647, Yeah.,ross
4648," No, no, they will. I just... uh...",ross
4649," Come on, they're gonna love you.",ross
4650," Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like ""forget about her"" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, ""Oh my god."" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?",phoebe
4651, Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Emergency! Excuse me!,rachel
4652, Rache!,ross
4653," Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?",rachel
4654," It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?",ross
4655, What?,rachel
4656, You're bleeding.,ross
4657," I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. I wanna hear everything!",rachel
4658," Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.",ross
4659," These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.",rachel
4660," Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.",rachel
4661," I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross.",monica
4662," Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?",phoebe
4663," Um, this?",joey
4664, Yes.,phoebe
4665," Guys, you got your hair cut.",monica
4666," Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.",chandler
4667," 'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.",phoebe
4668," Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.",rachel
4669," Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.",chandler
4670," You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!",rachel
4671," That's all right, Rache, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica, Chandler, Joey. Everyone, this is Julie.",ross
4672, And bus.,ross
4673, You gotta hear this story.,ross
4674," And the chicken poops in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.",rachel
4675," This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?",monica
4676," But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.",ross
4677," Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?",rachel
4678, It's just an expression.,monica
4679," Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.",ross
4680," Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.",ross
4681," Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen, 'cause I like to be surprised.",chandler
4682," Hey, Rache, can I get some coffee?",ross
4683," Yeah, sure.",rachel
4684, Thank you.,ross
4685," Hey, Rache, can I get--",chandler
4686, Did you talk to him?,rachel
4687, Not yet.,chandler
4688," Then, no.",rachel
4689," So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.",chandler
4690," I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?",ross
4691, God?,chandler
4692," It was you, pal.",ross
4693," Well, maybe it was God, doing me.",chandler
4694," Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.",ross
4695," Well, you owe me one, big guy.",chandler
4696, Here's your lemonade.,rachel
4697, I didn't order lemonade.,ross
4698," Oh. Well than, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.",rachel
4699, But--,ross
4700," Go go go go, come on! Well, what did you find out?",rachel
4701," He said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself without any outside help whatsoever.",chandler
4702, How is that the silver lining?,ross
4703, You have to really wanna see it.,chandler
4704," Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.",ross
4705," Phoebes, you know what I'm thinking?",monica
4706," Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had s*x, you're wondering if they've changed it?",phoebe
4707," No, although now that's what I'm thinking.",monica
4708," All right, so what were you thinking?",phoebe
4709," Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?",monica
4710, Oh. No.,phoebe
4711, Why not?,monica
4712," Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly a**l and an unbelievable control freak.",phoebe
4713, No you're not.,monica
4714," I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.",phoebe
4715," Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie.",joey
4716, Hello? Hi.,ross
4717, Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?,chandler
4718, Needs some clothes altered?,joey
4719," No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.",chandler
4720," Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?",joey
4721, You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!,chandler
4722," Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either. Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y--",ross
4723," Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.",rachel
4724, Rachel! I'll just call her back.,ross
4725," Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.",rachel
4726," Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.",monica
4727," I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.",rachel
4728," Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.",chandler
4729," You know, I think I was sixteen.",joey
4730," Please, just a little bit off the back.",monica
4731," I'm still on ""no"".",phoebe
4732," Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?",rachel
4733," No no no no no, I'm not fallin' for that again.",joey
4734, What's goin' on?,phoebe
4735," Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",rachel
4736, What stupid thing did you do?,chandler
4737, Ewww!,phoebe
4738," Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.",rachel
4739," Rachel, how did this happen?",monica
4740," I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.",rachel
4741, Where?,phoebe
4742, At his apartment. Is this juice?,rachel
4743," Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?",joey
4744," I know, I know I'm a pathetic loser.",rachel
4745," Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.",monica
4746, People do stupid things when they're upset.,chandler
4747," My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't--but this is about your horrible mistake.",monica
4748," Hi. Sorry we're late but we were--well, there was touching.",ross
4749," Hey, hey Ross.",phoebe
4750," Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?",ross
4751," So, uh, he's back.",ross
4752," Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?",rachel
4753," No, not a problem.",ross
4754, I'm glad it's not a problem.,rachel
4755," Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.",phoebe
4756," Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.",chandler
4757," Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey says hello. He'll know what it means.",joey
4758, Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?,chandler
4759," You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.",monica
4760," All right. Ok, but, but you have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.",phoebe
4761, I promise.,monica
4762," All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.",phoebe
4763," All right, that's it, I quit.",phoebe
4764, What? I didn't say anything.,monica
4765," Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.",phoebe
4766," I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.",monica
4767, Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.,phoebe
4768, How who wears it?,monica
4769, Demi Moore.,phoebe
4770, Demi Moore is not a he.,monica
4771," Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.",phoebe
4772, That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.,monica
4773," Oh, oh, oh my god!",phoebe
4774, Oh my god!,monica
4775," I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?",phoebe
4776," She's the actress who was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost.",monica
4777," Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.",phoebe
4778, I KNOW!,monica
4779, At least as long as I have the pants.,chandler
4780, How is she?,rachel
4781," It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.",phoebe
4782, How's the hair?,ross
4783," I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.",phoebe
4784, Can we see her?,joey
4785," Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, you come on in.",phoebe
4786, How're you doing?,joey
4787, I'm ok.,rachel
4788," Ooh, that bad, huh? Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.",joey
4789," When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, then 50 feet of crap, then me.",rachel
4790, You gotta tell Ross how you feel.,joey
4791, Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?,rachel
4792, What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.,joey
4793," I don't know, I don't know.",rachel
4794," Look, Rache, Rache, I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.",joey
4795," Yo, paisan. Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man.",chandler
4796, Frankie? What're you talking about?,joey
4797," Hey, what's goin' on?",ross
4798, Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.,chandler
4799, What?,ross
4800, No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.,joey
4801," He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite--",chandler
4802, what?,ross
4803, Cupping.,chandler
4804," That's how they do pants. First they go up one side, they move it over, they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?",joey
4805," Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?",ross
4806, What? That's not? Oh my god.,joey
4807, Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.,monica
4808," I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.",ross
4809, Thank you. My hair is very amused.,monica
4810," Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.",chandler
4811, Thank you.,phoebe
4812," Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rache.",ross
4813," Wait, are you leaving?",rachel
4814," Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by ""bye!""",ross
4815," Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...",joey
4816, That's ok.,chandler
4817, What's goin' on?,ross
4818," Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all, what?",rachel
4819," Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?",ross
4820, No.,rachel
4821," Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that. You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking ""Oh my god, I'm with Rachel"". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?",ross
4822," No, I think that was the whole all.",rachel
4823," I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.",joey
4824, You wanna do it right now?,phoebe
4825," Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andy McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?",phoebe
4826, No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andy McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.,rachel
4827," Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.",phoebe
4828, You're welcome.,rachel
4829," Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.",monica

4837," This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.",ross
4838," Carol, Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?",chandler
4839," Uh, does it hurt?",joey
4840, Chandler?,joey
4841," So, uh, how often can you do it?",chandler

4888," Ben, dinner!",phoebe
4889," Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.",ross
4890," Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.",phoebe
4891, What did you just do?,chandler
4892," I licked my arm, what?",phoebe
4893, It's breast milk.,ross
4894, So?,phoebe
4895," Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.",rachel
4896, What is the big deal?,joey
4897, What did you just do?,chandler
4898," Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?",ross
4899, You won't even taste it?,phoebe
4900, No!,ross
4901, Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?,phoebe
4902, Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.,ross
4903," Hey, where is everybody?",monica
4904, They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?,rachel
4905," Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.",monica
4906," Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon. Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?",rachel
4907, You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.,monica
4908, And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket,rachel
4909, That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.,monica
4910," Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?",rachel
4911, Judy.,monica
4912, Who?,rachel
4913, Julie.,monica
4914, What?,rachel
4915, Jody.,monica
4916, You were with Julie?,rachel
4917," Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.",monica
4918, Oh. Oh my god.,rachel
4919," Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.",monica
4920," Yeah, right.",rachel
4921," Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out.",monica
4922," Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.",rachel
4923, That is not true!,monica
4924," Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?",rachel
4925, Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?,monica
4926," Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdales? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.",rachel
4927," Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanna, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.",monica
4928," Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.",phoebe
4929, I did not freak out.,ross
4930, Because it's breast milk. It's gross.,ross
4931," No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults.",ross
4932, Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.,chandler
4933, That would be no.,ross
4934, Come on. It doesn't taste bad.,phoebe
4935," Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh--",joey
4936, Exactly.,joey
4937, You've tasted it? You've tasted it.,ross
4938," Oh, you've tasted it.",ross
4939, Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.,ross
4940, Howdy.,chandler
4941," Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.",joey
4942," Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.",chandler
4943," Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.",joey
4944, What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.,chandler
4945," I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.",joey
4946," All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?",chandler
4947, Yeah I guess you're right.,joey
4948, You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.,chandler
4949, I'm gonna do it.,joey
4950, All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.,chandler
4951, I don't know what else to say.,monica
4952," Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.",rachel
4953," I feel terrible, I really do.",monica
4954," Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?",rachel
4955," Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?",monica
4956, Yes.,rachel
4957, It's that terrible?,monica
4958," Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually, but now she's actually stealing you.",rachel
4959," Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.",monica
4960, I love you too.,rachel
4961," You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.",phoebe
4962," Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?",monica
4963," I'd do anything for you, you know that.",rachel
4964, I'd do anything for you.,monica
4965," Wait, wait, wait, wait!",phoebe
4966," Mornin'. I said, mornin'.",joey
4967," Yeah, I'm ready.",joey
4968," These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?",joey
4969," So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?",rachel
4970, Really? Me?,rachel
4971," Well, you're not totally paranoid.",rachel
4972," Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",rachel
4973," Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.",rachel
4974," All right, Julie. What a manipulative bitch.",rachel
4975, Hey.,chandler
4976, So how was Joan?,monica
4977, I broke up with her.,chandler
4978," They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.",chandler
4979," Come on, they were not that huge.",rachel
4980," I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.",chandler
4981, How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?,monica
4982," Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.",joey
4983, You or me?,chandler
4984," I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.",ross
4985," You guys are messin' with me, right?",joey
4986," That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, ""whoa.""",joey
4987, You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.,phoebe
4988, Maureen Rosilla.,chandler
4989, Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.,ross
4990," Hello, Mr. Heckles.",monica
4991, We're not doing anything.,monica
4992, You don't have birds.,rachel
4993," Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.",monica
4994," All right, bye-bye.",rachel
4995," Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.",chandler
4996, We'll give you Janice.,ross
4997," I miss Janice though. ""Hello, Chandler Bing.""",phoebe
4998," ""Oh, my, god.""",rachel
4999," ""Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!""",joey
5000," Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.",monica
5001, We won. We won!,rachel
5002, Mr. Heckles.,monica
5003, How did this happen?,rachel
5004, That's terrible.,monica
5005," Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!",phoebe
5006," Ok, Phoebe.",chandler
5007," I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.",phoebe
5008, Such as?,joey
5009," Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?",phoebe
5010," Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?",ross
5011, Nah. Not really.,phoebe
5012, You don't believe in evolution?,ross
5013," I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.",phoebe
5014," Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?",ross
5015," Yeah, I just don't buy it.",phoebe
5016," Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.",ross
5017," Ok, don't get me started on gravity.",phoebe
5018," You uh, you don't believe in gravity?",ross
5019," Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.",phoebe
5020," Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.",chandler
5021, What can we do for you?,monica
5022," Well, what about his family?",monica
5023," Ok, so let's talk money.",rachel
5024," I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!",monica
5025, Have you ever seen so much crap?,rachel
5026," Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap",chandler
5027, Check this out. Can I have this?,joey
5028, How can you not believe in evolution?,ross
5029, Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!,phoebe
5030," Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.",ross
5031, Really? You can actually see it?,phoebe
5032," You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.",ross
5033," See, I didn't know that.",phoebe
5034," Well, there you go.",ross
5035," Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?",phoebe
5036," Hey, look at this. ""My Big Book of Grievances.""",chandler
5037," Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.",joey
5038," April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.",chandler
5039," Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.",rachel
5040," Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.",monica
5041," What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.",rachel
5042, It doesn't go with any of my stuff.,monica
5043," Well, what about my stuff?",rachel
5044, You don't have any stuff.,monica
5045," You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?",rachel
5046, No.,monica
5047," Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.",rachel
5048, Mmmmm.,monica
5049," Ok, while you ""mmm"" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.",rachel
5050," Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?",ross
5051, Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.,phoebe
5052, Please tell me you're joking.,ross
5053," Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.",phoebe
5054," No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--",ross
5055," What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.",phoebe
5056, Is there blood coming out of my ears?,ross
5057," Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.",joey
5058," Wow, he looks so normal.",chandler
5059, He's even kind of cute.,phoebe
5060," ""Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.",joey
5061, Funniest? Heckles?,chandler
5062, That's what it says.,joey
5063," Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?",chandler
5064, I'd call that excessive.,phoebe
5065, Whoa!,chandler
5066, What?,joey
5067," Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.",chandler
5068," So, you were both dorks. Big deal.",joey
5069," I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?",chandler
5070, Have you been here all night?,joey
5071," Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.",chandler
5072," Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.",joey
5073," Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.",chandler
5074," All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.",joey
5075," What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it ""supposably""?",chandler
5076," Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.",joey
5077, How do you know that? How?,chandler
5078," I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.",joey
5079," You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?",chandler
5080," Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?",joey
5081," Yeah, I understand.",chandler
5082," You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?",joey
5083, You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.,chandler
5084, Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.,joey
5085,"  Hi, it's me.",chandler
5086, Janice? You called Janice?,phoebe
5087," Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?",chandler
5088," You remember Janice, right?",ross
5089," Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.",chandler
5090," Oh, my, god!",chandler
5091," Geez, look how fat she got.",joey
5092," Janice, you're--",chandler
5093, Is it--?,chandler
5094, Congratulations.,chandler
5095, You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?,chandler
5096," Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?",monica
5097, What?,rachel
5098, Hide the Lamp.,monica
5099," Monica, let it go.",rachel
5100, Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?,monica
5101," Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.",rachel
5102, Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.,phoebe
5103," Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.",ross
5104," Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.",phoebe
5105," It's the only possibility, Phoebe.",ross
5106," Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?",phoebe
5107," There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.",ross
5108, I can't believe you caved.,phoebe
5109, What?,ross
5110," You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?",phoebe
5111, I am. Let me just get my coat.,rachel
5112," Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.",monica
5113," Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?",rachel
5114," Phoebe, tell her!",monica
5115," Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.",phoebe
5116, Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.,rachel
5117, Neat. I'm gonna die alone.,chandler
5118," Ok, you win.",rachel
5119," Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.",monica
5120," Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.",chandler
5121, Uh huh. Why is that?,phoebe
5122," If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. ""Run away from Crazy Snake Man,"" they'll shout!",chandler
5123, You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.,monica
5124," Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.",chandler
5125," Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.",rachel
5126, You are not a freak. You're a guy.,monica
5127, She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.,rachel
5128," Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.",monica
5129, In a bad way?,chandler
5130," No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.",monica
5131, Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.,rachel
5132," Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!",phoebe
5133, You made it!,monica
5134, You're there!,phoebe
5135, You are ready to make a commitment!,rachel
5136, Whoa! Don't know about that.,chandler
5137, What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?,rachel
5138," No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.",monica
5139, Thank you.,rachel

So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.",phoebe
5887, Wow.,joey
5888," Yeah, so I said, ""OK, relax please,"" y'know, I mean, s*x can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.",phoebe
5889," Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.",joey

5904," Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.",rachel

5906," Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?",rachel

6012," I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.",ross
6013, You could say that.,joey
6014," And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.",ross
6015, Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?,chandler

6054, And I'm in it? Then let me read it.,rachel
6055, Come on.,rachel
6056," Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?",joey
6057," [through gritted teeth] Alright. [clears his throat] ""It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end.""",chandler
6058, That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.,ross
6059," All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.",rachel
6060," No, you don't.",ross
6061," All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it. [Rachel grabs the paper and runs across the room, reading it to herself.]",rachel
6062," What is this? Ross, what is this?",rachel
6063, Good luck.,chandler
6064," Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?",ross
6065, Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?,rachel
6066," Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type ""little"", the idiot.",ross
6067, Just a waitress?,rachel
6068," No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?",ross
6069, Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!,rachel
6070," No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.",ross
6071, She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.,rachel
6072," No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?",ross
6073," My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.",chandler
6074," You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.",monica
6075, I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.,phoebe
6076," Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.",joey
6077, What?,phoebe
6078, What?,monica
6079," Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.",chandler
6080, This was your idea?,monica
6081, What were you thinking?,phoebe
6082," [squirming] All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.",chandler
6083, Yeah. You!,monica
6084," All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?",chandler
6085," Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.",phoebe
6086," Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!",ross
6087," [coldly] When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.",rachel
6088, I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.,ross
6089, Not interested.,rachel
6090," [reading his list] Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.",ross
6091, Number six: the way you smell.,ross
6092," [opens the drapes] Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?",joey
6093," Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?",ross
6094," Oh, yeah, I do.",joey
6095, What are you doing out there?,chandler
6096," I am, uh, I am...",ross
6097," Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?",monica
6098," Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.",ross
6099, No.,rachel
6100, No?,ross
6101, That's what I said.,rachel
6102," Look, maybe we should go?",chandler
6103," No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.",rachel
6104," Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.",ross
6105," [near tears] No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.",rachel
6106," No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.",ross
6107," Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. [to the others] I said don't go!",rachel
6108," You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.",ross
6109," Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.",rachel
6110," [quietly] I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? [Ross stares blankly at him] Maybe a little longer.",joey
6111," Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.",monica
6112, What?,monica
6113," Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.",monica
6114," Well, uh, I ate some.",monica
6115, Hello?,monica

6117," [to Monica] Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.",rachel
6118," [to Ross] Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.",monica
6119," Look, can, can you do something for me?",ross
6120," Sure, what? Ok, ok. [hangs up the phone] [to Rachel] Music?",monica
6121," Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.",monica
6122, Cat hair.,monica

6129," Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.",monica
6130, And twenty-five it is.,chandler
6131, You gave him cookies?,joey
6132," Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.",monica
6133, I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.,phoebe
6134," Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?",chandler
6135," Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.",phoebe
6136," So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?",ross
6137," Uhh, the mailman, the super.",rachel
6138," Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.",monica
6139, Oh my God.,joey
6140, What?,rachel
6141," Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.",joey
6142," Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.",rachel
6143," Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.",monica
6144," Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.",ross
6145," I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.",joey
6146, Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.,chandler
6147, Hey guys.,ross
6148," Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. [Rachel is not impressed]. . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. [sings] Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . .",ross
6149, Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?,rachel
6150," How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? [Rachel walks off] Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?",ross
6151," Here, go nuts. [gives him the Slinky and goes and sits with others at the couches]",ross

6159," Ross, that is gorgeous!",monica

6162, Hey.,phoebe
6163," Happy Christmas Eve Eve. [sees Ross's picture frame] Oh my God, where did you get this?",phoebe
6164," Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.",ross
6165," This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.",phoebe
6166," Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.",chandler
6167," No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.",phoebe
6168," Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.",rachel
6169," No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.",phoebe
6170, How have you never been on Oprah?,rachel
6171," [showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.",phoebe
6172," Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.",monica
6173," It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]",phoebe
6174," Oh, wait a minute honey.",monica
6175, Wow.,monica
6176," So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .",joey

6182," OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.",phoebe
6183," Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.",phoebe
6184, Oh God.,phoebe
6185," Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?",phoebe
6186," OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?",phoebe
6187, [realizes] Oh.,phoebe
6188, Oh.,phoebe
6189," Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.",chandler
6190," Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.",rachel
6191, Who said anything about Christmas?,chandler
6192, Hi.,monica

6203, Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?,chandler
6204," Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent. [hands her a smashed box]",rachel
6205," Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.",monica
6206," Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.",joey

6218, Wow. Thank you.,phoebe

6236," Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.",phoebe
6237, [grabs for seat belt] Where's my seat belt?,chandler
6238," Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. [Chandler jumps out of the car]",phoebe

6301," Well, so why not go knock?",chandler
6302," Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.",phoebe

6335," You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.",monica

6337," Here it is, here it is. [reading from newspaper] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.",joey
6338," OK, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. Phoebs, read yours.",chandler
6339," OK. [reading] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...",phoebe

6345," Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.",ross
6346," No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.",joey
6347," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believe this will change your mind. [Reads from paper] In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able to achieve brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153...[turns it] sucking.",monica
6348," When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.",joey
6349, [sullenly] Hiiiiii.,ross
6350, Are... are you OK?,phoebe
6351," Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?",ross
6352, Maybe.,monica
6353, Don't toy with me.,ross

6358," No, I'm alright man. Really.",joey
6359," Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... [Fun Bobby picks Joey up off the ground, bounces him. Joey laughs.] Alright! It still works.",joey
6360," OK, I'll see you later babe.",monica
6361, Fun Bobby is so great.,phoebe
6362," Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.",monica
6363, Half full of looooovvvvve.,phoebe
6364," And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.",monica
6365, Cabin of loooooovvvvve.,phoebe
6366," We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys. [walks over to table, holding five empty wine bottles]",rachel

6377," Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'",phoebe
6378," Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?",joey
6379," Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.",monica
6380," Rach, does this have nonfat milk?",monica
6381," Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.",rachel
6382," [takes a sip] Mmmm, no.",monica
6383," Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.",rachel
6384," Um, cake.",phoebe
6385," Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake. [Phoebe and Rachel go to counter.]",rachel
6386, You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.,monica
6387, Bobby.,monica
6388," Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.",monica
6389," So, what are you saying now?",monica
6390," [comes back to couch, with cake] Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?",phoebe
6391," [sad] Ooohh, why?",phoebe

6398," No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.",chandler
6399," Oh, no.",phoebe
6400," OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.",chandler
6401," Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!",joey
6402," Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.",phoebe
6403," Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.",chandler
6404," Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.",phoebe
6405," Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.",rachel

6407," Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.",rachel
6408, What?,monica
6409, With a man?,joey
6410, What? What is so strange about me having a date?,rachel
6411," What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?",joey
6412," Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.",rachel
6413, What are you talking about?,monica
6414," I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.",rachel
6415, But you guys came so close.,phoebe
6416," Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.",rachel
6417," Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.",rachel
6418," Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.",joey
6419, No.,joey
6420," OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...",joey
6421," Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.",joey
6422, What's the matter?,rachel
6423, It's Fun Bobby.,monica
6424," What, isn't he sober?",rachel
6425," Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.",monica
6426," Ohhh, OK.",rachel
6427," Alright, here you go, sweetie. [hands Fun Bobby his coffee]",monica
6428," Oh God, yes!",monica
6429, That is funny.,phoebe

6431, Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.,chandler
6432, Oh.... my... God.,monica
6433, It's not that bad.,phoebe
6434, Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?,monica
6435," OK, OK, don't get all squinky.",phoebe
6436, Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.,rachel
6437," But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.",monica
6438," Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.",phoebe
6439, [turning around] Hey Ross.... bahhhh!,chandler
6440," Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?",rachel
6441," Rachel? Um, hi.",phoebe

6448," Oh, my, oh!",phoebe

6452, Alright.,ross
6453," [to Phoebe] Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. [introducing Russ and Ross] Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.",chandler
6454, Hi.,ross

6459," Yes, yes I am. And you are a....",ross
6460, See? They're as different as night and... later that night.,monica
6461," Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.",ross

6465," Well, we're not seeing each other, so....",rachel
6466," Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...",ross
6467," Well, yeah, this is the deal.",rachel
6468," OK, well, um, have a nice evening.",ross
6469," Um, Russ, you ready?",rachel
6470, Bye.,rachel

6474," Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?",chandler
6475, What do you mean?,ross
6476, Do you not see it?,monica
6477," See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.",ross
6478," Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?",chandler
6479, ....................Yeah.,ross
6480, Hey.,chandler
6481, Hey.,joey
6482," Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.",chandler
6483," Well, the part's mine if I want it.",joey
6484, Oh my God!,chandler
6485," Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.",joey
6486, [not knowing how to react] Oh my... God?,chandler
6487," Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.",joey
6488," So, what're you gonna do?",chandler
6489," Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?",joey
6490," Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.",chandler
6491, I've never slept with someone for a part.,joey
6492," Well is she... [reaches into the cookie jar for a cookie, takes his hand out, covered with pasta sauce]",chandler
6493, Sorry.,joey
6494, It's alright. Is she good-looking?,chandler
6495," Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. [pause] You know, after having slept with her.",joey
6496," Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have s*x. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.",chandler
6497," I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.",joey
6498, Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?,chandler
6499," Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.",joey
6500," Yes, I would like something. [looks at Fun Bobby, changes her mind] No, no thank you.",monica
6501," No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. [to waiter] Just some water.",monica
6502, [grabs waiter as he's leaving] I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.,monica
6503," Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.",chandler
6504, [condescendingly] Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.,ross
6505," And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.",chandler
6506, You don't see it? You actually don't see it?,phoebe
6507, What?,rachel
6508," OK honey, you're dating Ross.",phoebe
6509," No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.",rachel
6510, Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!,phoebe
6511, Steve... sleeve!,rachel
6512," OK, noone is named Sleeve.",phoebe
6513," Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.",rachel
6514," [to Russ] For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.",ross
6515," OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.",chandler
6516," Oh you do, do you?",ross
6517, Of... of what?,ross
6518," Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.",ross
6519," No, no, let me finish.",ross
6520," No, you let me fini...",ross
6521, Hi.,ross
6522," Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww! [turns away]",rachel
6523, Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?,rachel
6524," No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?",chandler
6525, I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?,rachel
6526, Me.,chandler
6527, Why would I have to sleep with you?,rachel
6528, It's my game. You want the job or not?,chandler
6529, Hey.,chandler
6530, Morning.,monica
6531, Where ya goin'?,ross
6532," Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?",monica
6533, Ooooohhhh.,ross
6534, What's with all the bottles of liquor?,phoebe
6535," What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?",ross
6536," Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.",monica
6537," Oh God, even his knock is boring.",rachel
6538, Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.,monica
6539, Sure.,monica
6540," Oh God, you fell off the wagon.",monica
6541, What about me?,monica
6542," What these? [holding up liquor bottles] Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.",monica
6543, Oh... shoot.,monica
6544, OK.,monica
6545, Take care.,monica
6546, What happened?,rachel
6547, Well we... we kinda broke up.,monica
6548, [holding bottles] Does anybody want these?,monica
6549, I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.,chandler
6550, Hey.,joey
6551, How'd the callback go?,ross
6552, It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.,joey
6553, So what'd you do?,chandler
6554," Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.",joey
6555, Good for you.,ross
6556," But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.",joey
6557, So... and?,phoebe
6558," Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!",joey
6559, Alright... I've got to go shower. [leaves],joey
6560," Oh, hey.",chandler
6561, Hi.,phoebe
6562," Yeah, I'm sorry man.",chandler
6563," Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.",phoebe
6564, Hey!,chandler
6565," Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?",phoebe
6566," Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!",ross
6567," Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.",ross
6568, Ok.,ross
6569," Oh, you and me?",ross
6570, Ok.,ross
6571," As in, ""I now pronounce you wife and wife"" married?",ross
6572, Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.,ross
6573," No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!",ross
6574, Mmm hmmm.,ross
6575, Uh-huh.,ross
6576, This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.,ross
6577," It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..",joey
6578," Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.",monica
6579," They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?",monica
6580, Would it matter?,ross
6581," Oh, you are so great! [kisses him] Thank you!",monica
6582, Are you really not going?,joey
6583," I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?",ross
6584," They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.",monica
6585, If you wanna call that a reason.,ross
6586," [singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood] Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.",chandler
6587," Ross, I thought you were over this.",monica
6588," Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.",ross
6589," Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.",joey
6590, [entering hurriedly] Did I miss it? Did I miss it?,rachel
6591," No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.",joey
6592," Whoa, she's pretty.",chandler
6593," Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.",joey
6594," I'm sorry, what?",rachel
6595, What?,monica
6596," It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.",joey
6597," Oh, ok.",chandler
6598," There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] ""Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.",joey
6599, I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.,joey
6600, Nice!,chandler
6601, That's great!,rachel
6602, Excellent!,ross
6603, For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.,chandler
6604, That is so good! Do it again!,ross
6605," All right, all right. ""Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!""",joey
6606," That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.",chandler
6607," No no, that's me.",ross
6608," Oh, yeah.",chandler
6609," Oh, hello.",ross
6610," Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...",phoebe
6611, Is everything ok?,ross
6612," Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.",phoebe
6613, Oh my god.,ross
6614, That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.,chandler
6615," Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.",phoebe
6616," Oh, honey.",monica
6617," Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ""ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage."" Little did she know God was thinking, ""Ok, but that's it."" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.",phoebe
6618, What do you mean?,rachel
6619, I think it went into me.,phoebe
6620," God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.",monica
6621," Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.",chandler
6622," Ok, who ordered what?",rachel
6623," Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.",ross
6624," Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?",chandler
6625, Oh god.,rachel
6626, I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.,joey
6627," I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?",rachel
6628, [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.,phoebe
6629," Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?",joey
6630," I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Sit up!",phoebe
6631, Mom!,rachel
6632, Pretty much.,rachel
6633," This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.",rachel
6634," Hi, Mrs. Green. [He gets up to shake her hand, but she ignores him.]",ross
6635, Oh Mom!,rachel
6636," Believe me, sometimes that happens.",chandler
6637, Really?,rachel
6638," I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.",phoebe
6639," Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?",joey
6640, I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?,phoebe
6641," Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.",rachel
6642," I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?",rachel
6643, For...me.,rachel
6644," Well, what do you mean?",rachel
6645," [entering] All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.",monica
6646, Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.,rachel
6647, Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.,monica
6648, And you had no idea they weren't getting along?,ross
6649, None.,rachel
6650, They didn't fight a lot?,joey
6651," No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?",rachel
6652," [Mrs. Adelman's voice] In my day, divorce was not an option.",phoebe
6653," Hey, look who's up.",joey
6654," I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.",rachel
6655," Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.",monica
6656," Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?",rachel
6657," You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.",chandler
6658, That's him.,phoebe
6659, Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.,chandler
6660," Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.",phoebe
6661," Um, do you wanna sit?",phoebe
6662," I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.",phoebe
6663," Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?",phoebe
6664, Everything?,phoebe
6665," Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.",phoebe
6666," I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.",phoebe
6667, These are from Halloween three years ago.,rachel
6668," No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.",rachel
6669," Um, you guys, you know when I said before, ""thank you, but I don't really need your help""?",monica
6670," Actually, what I think you said was, ""don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.""",rachel
6671," Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.",monica
6672," Hey, Mon, you want some help?",rachel
6673, If you want.,monica
6674," [enters] Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.",phoebe
6675, She's still with you?,rachel
6676," Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. [Takes Mrs. Green's chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh, such a pretty face.",phoebe
6677, God!,rachel
6678," All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.",monica
6679, Oh! What's new in s*x?,rachel
6680," I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.",monica
6681," Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?",rachel
6682, You want me to talk you out of it?,rachel

6739, I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.,ross
6740," I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.",phoebe
6741, And the fact that they're both monkeys.,monica
6742," Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.",ross
6743," Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.",rachel
6744," Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.",ross

6768, Let's get out of here.,joey
6769, The one time they're not home.,chandler
6770," OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.",joey

6787, Oh my God.,rachel
6788," Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.",monica
6789," Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.",chandler
6790," No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.",phoebe
6791," I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?",phoebe

7165," Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?",joey
7166," OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that.

7878, We don't need to remedy that.,chandler
7879," Oh yeah, it'll be fun. [throws a tennis ball at Eddie's bedroom door]",phoebe

8357," Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.",ross
8358, Uh-huh.,rachel
8359," Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.",ross
8360," Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.",rachel
8361, Huh?,ross

8384," It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?",monica

8391," [enters] Ok, what the hell happened back there?",ross
8392," I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.",rachel

8400," Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.",rachel
8401, Yeah.,ross
8402," But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.",rachel
8403, Ok fine.,ross
8404, Thank you.,rachel
8405, We're not done.,ross
8406, I didn't know that.,rachel
8407," Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.",ross
8408," Fine, I will.",rachel

8420," Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?",monica
8421," I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, ""It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does.""",phoebe
8422, Kick save and... denied.,chandler

[starts the tape again]",phoebe
8472," Oh, I'm so glad you're here.",phoebe
8473," Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?",joey

8481, And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.,phoebe
8482, His indian name?,monica

8696, What?,monica
8697, Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?,ross
8698, You wanna be in charge of the food committee?,monica
8699, Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?,ross
8700, Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?,joey
8701, Yeah.,ross
8702," Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.",phoebe
8703," Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.",monica
8704," Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See [squeezes her breast] honk honk.",monica

8708," Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.",joey
8709, Why not her?,phoebe
8710," Cause she uh, she steals stuff.",joey
8711, Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.,chandler
8712, Joey that is horriable.,monica
8713," Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.",joey
8714," I'm sorry, I didn't know.",phoebe
8715," I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.",joey
8716," Hi honey, how did it go?",ross
8717," Agh, it was the graduation from hell.",rachel
8718," Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.",chandler
8719," Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.",rachel
8720, So what happened?,monica
8721," My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.",rachel
8722," Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.",phoebe
8723," Well, how bout just her mom?",monica
8724, Why her mom?,chandler
8725, Cause I already invited her.,monica

8732," Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.",joey
8733, [answers the door] Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?,monica
8734," No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.",monica
8735," No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.",monica
8736," This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?",chandler
8737, Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.,monica
8738," So, basically just a Chinese guy.",chandler
8739," Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.",joey
8740," Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.",monica

8742," And because you're both, you know, white women.",phoebe
8743," NO! No, I'll take that for ya.",chandler
8744," [cutting Mrs. Greene off] Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon. [they go in the bathroom]",phoebe
8745," Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.",monica
8746," Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?",chandler
8747," [peeks back out] Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, [sees that the coast is clear] oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.",joey
8748," So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.",monica
8749," Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?",chandler
8750, Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.,monica
8751, Right this is staging.,joey
8752," Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.",chandler
8753," [as they're walking out, Dr. Greene questioningly gestures at the Happy Birthday sign over the door] This is clearly in the wrong apartment. [they all walk across the hall]",joey
8754," Alright you guys are off to party number one [ushers 3 guys into Monica's apartment] and you, you are off to party number two [ushers four women into his apartment. Two guys try to follow and Chandler blocks them and shoos them off to Monica's apartment] Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.",chandler

8775," Well, we could count again.",chandler
8776, I can't believe this is happening.,rachel
8777," You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.",ross
8778, I do.,rachel
8779, That's who.,ross

8794," Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.",monica
8795," Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?",ross

8838," Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.",chandler
8839," Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.",rachel
8840, Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?,chandler
8841," It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...",rachel

8851," Sorry, we're on a major flan high.",chandler
8852," Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. [opens the door, the guys are right there] Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.",phoebe
8853," Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.",phoebe

8873," Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.",phoebe
8874, You went out with a guy in the Navy?,rachel

8876," Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?",joey

8899, But don't you need experience for a job like that?,joey
8900," It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.",chandler
8901," Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.",chandler
8902," Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.",joey

8932, Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.,chandler
8933," Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.",joey
8934," Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.",chandler
8935," Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.",joey

8952, Sir.,joey
8953, Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.,chandler
8954," Yeah Bing, what's that about?",joey

8957," Uh, if you say so sir.",chandler

8961, Why?,chandler
8962," Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.",joey
8963, This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.,monica
8964, It's for their own good.,monica
8965," Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?",monica

8975, What if they get mixed up?,monica
8976," You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.",monica
8977, Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.,joey
8978, Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?,chandler
8979, 'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.,joey
8980," Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?",chandler
8981," Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.",joey
8982," Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.",chandler
8983," What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.",joey
8984," I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.",chandler
8985," Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.",joey
8986," Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.",chandler

8988," Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.",chandler
8989, Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.,joey
8990," Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.",chandler
8991, Really?,joey
8992," No freakshow, she's fictional.",chandler
8993," Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.",joey

Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match.

9711," Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....",chandler
9712," Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?",ross

9715," Okay, so you both just know this stuff?",chandler
9716," Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.",rachel
9717," Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?",ross
9718," That's easy, baggage claim.",chandler
9719,"  Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.",ross
9720," Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.",chandler
9721," Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers.  Okay, I'm late for work.",rachel
9722, Oh.,ross

9746," Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.",phoebe
9747," Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.",chandler
9748," Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.",phoebe
9749," Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.",ross
9750," No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.",phoebe

9768," Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!",ross
9769," It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.",monica
9770," That, that's what's stupid.",chandler

10525,"  Hey, you guys!",joey

10536, Y’know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.,ross
10537,  I know!,joey

10543," Good evening. I’m Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as  Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives,  I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don’t have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this.  Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.",joey
10544, Hi!,joey
10545, Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?,phoebe
10546," Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, ’Hey, the bell doesn’t dismiss you, I dismiss you.’",joey

10574, You remember Ross.,rachel
10575, Nice to see you again Dr. Green.,ross
10576," Ugh, museum.",ross
10577," There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.",ross
10578," Yeah, if you’re really hungry.  It was a joke, I made a joke.",ross
10579," Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.",rachel
10580, It’s not a library...,ross
10581," So, Dr. Green, how’s the old boat.",ross
10582, It gives it a nice antiquey look.,ross
10583," Wow. I’m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. ",ross
10584, Okay.,rachel
10585, Okay! ,ross
10586, Aw honey stop! It’s not that bad.,rachel
10587, Yeah.  Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must’ve added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.,ross
10588, Yeah. That’s Daddy.,rachel
10589, That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a waitress.,ross
10590," Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I’d be serving him sneezers.",rachel
10591, So?,ross
10592," So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not gonna change.",rachel
10593, You really serve people sneezers?,ross
10594," Well um, I don’t.",rachel
10595," Thanks again, Dr. Green.",ross
10596," Oh, ah, you don’t need that.",ross
10597," The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.",ross
10598," Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really.",ross
10599," Yeah it is, it is.  We really, really have to do something about that.",rachel
10600, I know.,ross
10601," Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he really didn’t.",rachel
10602," Nothing I do means anything, really.",ross
10603, Well Mr. Big Shot is better than ‘wethead’.,ross
10604," Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’  Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.  And that’s how it’s done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.",joey
10605, Hey-hey.,joey
10606," Awww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud.",joey

10609, Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food.,ross
10610," Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.",rachel
10611," Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.",ross
10612," Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?",ross
10613," I’m, I’m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn’t have! All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?",phoebe
10614, Um. yeah.,rachel
10615, I am soo dead. ,phoebe
10616," All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",rachel
10617," Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.",ross
10618," Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.",rachel
10619," Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’",ross
10620," Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",rachel
10621," Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.",ross

10677, Excellent!,ross
10678,"  There will come a time in each of your careers when you’ll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I’m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he’s got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV.

10691, See that is the problem with invisible dentists.,chandler

11607," A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich�. Why don't you get a magician?!",phoebe
11608," Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.",chandler
11609," She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and,  he's really good looking.  What am I gonna do?",ross

11724," Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog.

12399," Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?",joey
12400," You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did.",ross
12401," Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?",chandler
12402," What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?",ross
12403," Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble.",joey
12404," He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her.",chandler
12405," Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.",joey
12406," Yeah, but don’t you think....",ross
12407," All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.",chandler
12408," Yeah, okay. ",ross
12409," All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way.  Did you think about the trail?",joey
12410, What trail?,ross
12411,  The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!  You always have to think about the trail!,joey
12412," Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail.",ross
12413," Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!",chandler
12414,"  After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,",phoebe
12415, Did that!,monica
12416, Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.,phoebe
12417, Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!,monica
12418, Was it not pain-free?,phoebe
12419," No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.",monica
12420," Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.",phoebe
12421," That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.",monica
12422,  Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!,phoebe
12423," Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?",monica
12424,  Chloe? Hi..,ross
12425, You took my watch?,ross
12426," Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?",ross
12427," Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?",ross
12428," You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met...",ross
12429," Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.",ross
12430," Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.",ross
12431," Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?",ross
12432," Actually, no, we’re not.",ross
12433," No, we’re not.",ross
12434," No, we’re not!!",ross
12435, Right.,ross
12436, Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.,ross
12437,  Jasmine?,ross
12438," We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller.",ross
12439," Yes, I did.",ross
12440, Very bad.,ross
12441," I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?",ross
12442," Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?",ross
12443," Thank you, thank you.",ross
12444,  Who’s your roommate?,ross
12445," Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.",ross
12446, Ow!,monica
12447, Oh!!,phoebe
12448, Ow!! Ow!!,monica
12449, Ow!!!,phoebe
12450, We’re all right.,phoebe
12451," It’s okay, it’s okay.",monica
12452, We’re all right.,phoebe
12453, We were just waxing our legs.,monica
12454, Off?!!,chandler
12455," For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.",phoebe
12456," Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.",chandler
12457," Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax.",joey
12458," Oh yeah, come here. ",phoebe
12459," Oh, that’s mature.",chandler
12460," Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?",joey
12461, Uh-huh.,phoebe
12462, That’s right.,monica
12463,"  Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!",ross
12464, I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!,rachel

12473, Whe-where did he put it?!,phoebe
12474," Ross, you had s*x with another woman!",rachel
12475, Oh my God.,monica
12476," Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.",phoebe
12477," Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....",chandler
12478, Oh!!  You guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us?!,monica
12479,"  He has s*x, and we get hit in our heads.",chandler
12480,"  Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!",rachel
12481, No!!,ross
12482, Just get out! Now!!,rachel
12483, No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.,ross
12484, Okay! All right! How was she?,rachel

12500, Should we do something?,phoebe
12501," Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.",chandler
12502," I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.",ross
12503," Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave?  Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!",rachel
12504," Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!",ross
12505, And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!,rachel
12506," Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.",ross
12507, We were on a break!,rachel
12508," That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.",ross
12509, You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?,rachel
12510," Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!",ross
12511," Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!",rachel
12512," Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore. ",joey
12513,"  What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there.",monica
12514, Why not?!  I’m hungry.,joey

12516, God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!,rachel
12517," Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!",ross
12518," Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.",rachel
12519," Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.",chandler
12520," Yeah, we’ll be fine.",joey
12521," Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.",ross
12522,"  Wax the door shut, we’re never leaving, ever.",chandler
12523," Hi, it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, ‘cause it’s like 9:15 now, and I’m not there.",phoebe
12524, Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having s*x with Mark?,ross
12525, All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?,rachel
12526,  Yes I would.,ross
12527," You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?",rachel
12528,  Yes.,ross
12529," You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....",rachel

12553, Are you actually saying these words?,chandler
12554," What, now you’re not even taking to me?  Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey!",ross
12555," Whoa-ho-ho!  Yeah, okay.",joey
12556, Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.,monica
12557," Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.",phoebe
12558," Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!",ross
12559, That’s....,rachel
12560, That’s what?!,ross
12561, That is neither here nor there.,rachel
12562," Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail?  Look, I,  I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can’t.  I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.",ross
12563," No Ross!!  Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?",rachel
12564," Okay, okay, okay.",ross
12565,  I think you should go.,rachel
12566, What?,ross
12567,  I really think you need to go now.,rachel
12568,"  Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together...",ross
12569," Yeah, what the hell did I know!",rachel
12570," Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,  I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life without you.  Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach,  and, and....",ross
12571,"  No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t,  it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything. Forever.",rachel
12572,"  Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.",ross
12573, Then how come it is?,rachel
12574, They’ve been quiet for a long time.,phoebe
12575, Maybe she killed him?,joey

12590, Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.,joey
12591, Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else.,phoebe
12592," Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.",joey
12593," Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.",phoebe
12594," Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.",chandler
12595," Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....",phoebe

I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!",monica
13093," Yeah, kinda.",phoebe

13124, It’s just I miss her so much.,ross
13125, I know. ,chandler

13127, Y'know what?,rachel
13128, I can’t do this.,rachel
13129," Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.",rachel

13137, I’m sorry.,monica
13138, It’s not?,monica

13140, I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.  Draw!! ,chandler
13141,"  I wasn’t doing anything.  Uh-oh, what did she do now?",chandler
13142," Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she’s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!",joey

13177, Yeah! Oh my God!  Is this what it’s like to be you?,joey
13178," Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?",monica
13179," Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like somebody’s ripping out my heart!",joey
13180," Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this!",phoebe

13223,  And is this in case the house sneezes?,chandler
13224," No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic.",phoebe
13225, I don’t want a ghost.,monica

13329, Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!,chandler
13330," I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!",rachel

14157, Doug!!,chandler
14158, I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.,chandler

14160," Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.",chandler

14703, You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!,rachel
14704," No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.",phoebe
14705," Are you sure she’s in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again?",ross
14706," No Dr. Skeptismo! I’m sure. First of all, okay, there’s the feeling.  Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt.  My Mother’s favourite fish is Orange Roughy...  Cats....like....fish!   Hi, Mommy.  Oh, I haven’t seen this smile in 17 years!",phoebe

14717," Look, you and I went to different high schools...",monica
14718," Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school.",rachel
14719," You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.",monica
14720,  They had to have that specially made?!,rachel
14721, It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.,monica
14722,"  Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!",rachel
14723," Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.",monica
14724," Oh, you go out with him.  ",rachel
14725," Oh, really?!",monica

14731,"  Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.",phoebe
14732," So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?",ross
14733," Well, I’m not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there’s y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she’s worried that y'know, she’s gonna, she’s gonna be replaced.  Well, that’s not gonna happen is it? Noo.  Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.",phoebe
14734, Why can’t you use the phone in here?,monica
14735," Well, I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. ",phoebe
14736," So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?",ross
14737," Ross, don’t start.",monica
14738," Come on, you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that there’s a woman inside that cat!",ross

14837, I think she would like that.,phoebe
14838,"  Come here, here, come here, come here,  Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend’s mother.",ross

14856, I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.,monica

14858," Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.",monica
14859," Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do.",ross

14867,  No. No!,chandler
14868," Well, not at first.",chandler
14869, What is she doing here?,rachel
14870," I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’",rachel
14871," Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.",chandler
14872," Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!",rachel
14873," Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.",chandler

14884," Okay, I didn’t hear that.",phoebe

14901, And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!,phoebe
14902, Then why are you laughing?,monica
14903, What? You bet I’d lose a nail?,monica
14904, Frozen lasagnas?,monica
14905, You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was…,monica
14906," You promised Dr. Weinburg, you’d never use that phrase.",monica

14930,"  Rachel, could I see you for a moment?",chandler
14931," Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.",chandler
14932, You promised you would break up with her!,rachel
14933," I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!",chandler
14934, And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!,rachel
14935," It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.",chandler
14936," Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.",rachel
14937," No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and ",chandler

14945, You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great!  Ahhh! ,chandler

14948, Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?,rachel
14949, About what?,chandler
14950," When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired!",rachel
14951," I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!",chandler
14952," No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were! ",rachel

14965," Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on.",monica
14966," No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.",phoebe
14967, What?,monica
14968," Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, ""Yeah, he pulled a Monica."" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, ""Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica."" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, ""Yeah, that one’s outta here."" Though some things don’t change.",phoebe
14969,"  All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make.",monica

14996," I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.",rachel
14997, How do Monica and Phoebe know?,chandler
14998," Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous  or very  stingy.",rachel
14999,  Go on.,chandler
15000, I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle.,rachel
15001, And Milton Berle has a…,chandler
15002," Ohh, not compared to you. ",rachel

15340, Yeah! You don't like Kathy.,joey
15341, You got me.,chandler

15343, Yeah. Right.,chandler
15344," Good, and hey! My treat.  But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?",joey

15354, Ughh! ,rachel
15355,"  Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.",phoebe
15356, Thank you so much Phoebe.,monica
15357,  Sure.,phoebe
15358, What are you doing with those?!,monica
15359," But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.",phoebe

15365," Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.",chandler
15366, Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.,chandler
15367," Uhh, no-no thanks.",chandler
15368," Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. ",chandler
15369,  I'll be right back.  What was that?,joey

15371, Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.,joey
15372," Hey, look, what do you want from me?",chandler
15373," I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.",joey
15374, I am pretending.,chandler
15375," Well then, do it better!",joey
15376," Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?  No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!",chandler
15377," Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.",joey
15378,"  Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive.  So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?",ross
15379," No, sorry.",monica
15380, Well where's Amanda?,rachel
15381," Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?",monica
15382," I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.",rachel
15383," Ross, cough drops, please?",monica
15384, At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.,ross
15385," Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.",rachel
15386, You see Amanda and I have a very special...,ross
15387,  You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!,monica
15388,"  Ohh, that is soo sad.",rachel
15389," And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'",monica
15390," Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it! ",rachel
15391," That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!",monica
15392, Fine.,ross
15393, Sorry.,rachel
15394, Here.   At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.,ross
15395, Y'know...,rachel
15396,"  Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats.  Does it even work without my sexy voice?",phoebe
15397," Gunther, kiss me.",phoebe
15398,"  Hey!  Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?",joey
15399, Can I sleep on your couch?,chandler

15408," Yeah, come to papa.",phoebe
15409, I know!,ross
15410," Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?",monica
15411," Where did you, when did you, how did you...  How did you get a girl like that?",chandler
15412," Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?",rachel
15413," Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.",ross
15414," Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.",chandler
15415," I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.",ross
15416, Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.,rachel
15417, Fine by me; hope she wins.,ross
15418, Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?,chandler
15419, Oo! Is it for my birthday present?,phoebe
15420," Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.",chandler

15422," Well, I have a call in about that.",chandler
15423, 'Kay.,phoebe
15424," Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.",chandler
15425," Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!",rachel
15426," Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.",chandler
15427," Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?",rachel
15428," Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.",chandler
15429," Oh, honey, that's so sweet.",rachel
15430," Yeah, and what a great way to say, ""I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!""",phoebe
15431, It doesn't say that. Does it?,chandler
15432, How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?,ross
15433," Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.",chandler
15434, It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!,phoebe
15435,"  Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye.  I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.",monica
15436, Oh my God! What happened?,rachel
15437, Sixty guests.,monica
15438," So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?",ross
15439, Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.,monica
15440," Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican...  ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?",phoebe
15441, I don't know.,monica
15442," There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!",phoebe
15443, Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.,monica
15444," Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.",phoebe
15445," Well, you're not working either.",monica
15446," Yes, but I'm doing this.",phoebe
15447," Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!",monica
15448, Hey!,joey
15449, Why?,joey
15450, You can pee here!,joey

15455," And not one of your coupons for an hour of ""Joey Love.""",rachel
15456," Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?",phoebe
15457," No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.",rachel
15458, Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.,phoebe
15459, Hey!,monica
15460," Hey, how'd it go?",rachel
15461," Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow--the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!",monica
15462, Mon! I'm so happy for you!,phoebe
15463," Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff.  Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!",monica
15464," I'll have one, please. Plus my money.",phoebe
15465," Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look--I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.",monica
15466," Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.",phoebe
15467, Okay.,monica
15468,  Huh...,ross
15469, Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?,ross
15470, Mitzi is.....,ross
15471,"  Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh  ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?",ross
15472," Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...",ross
15473," Oh, yeah, why not?",ross
15474," Oh, is everything in the car?",monica
15475, Yes. Did you settle the bill?,phoebe
15476, No. I hate this part.,monica
15477," Oh, look what we almost left. ",phoebe
15478," No, that's not mine.",monica
15479," Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!",phoebe
15480," Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.",monica
15481," Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...",monica
15482, Just the matter of ...payment?,monica
15483, You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.,rachel
15484,  Sure...,chandler
15485, And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?,rachel
15486," I don't know... um, Grease?",chandler
15487, No....,rachel
15488, Rent?,chandler
15489, Yes! Rent!,rachel
15490," Okay, so when do you want to go?",chandler
15491," What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.",rachel
15492,"  Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.",joey
15493," Yes, it is, at Office Max.",chandler
15494, What did you get her? ,rachel
15495, A pen.,chandler
15496, It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?,joey
15497, Huh-huh! You can't give her that.,chandler
15498, Why not?,joey
15499, Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!,chandler
15500," Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?",rachel
15501," Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... ""Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!""",joey
15502," All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?",chandler
15503, She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.,joey
15504, For three years?,chandler
15505,"  Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...",joey
15506," All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?",chandler
15507," Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?",joey
15508, Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?,chandler
15509, Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.,joey
15510," But Mon, you have to get our money!",phoebe
15511," Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.",monica
15512," I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?",phoebe
15513, What?,monica
15514," Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, ""that massage wasn't long enough, or, ""I don't recognize any of those songs,"" or, you know, ""these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!""",phoebe
15515, Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?,monica
15516," Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.",phoebe
15517," Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.",monica
15518, She seems fine now.,phoebe
15519," So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?",joey
15520, You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?,ross
15521, Yeah.,joey
15522," Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived!  Here.",ross
15523," Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?",joey
15524, What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.,ross
15525," All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.",joey
15526," No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.",ross
15527, What kind of smell?,joey
15528, I don't know. Soap?,ross
15529," All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?",joey
15530, Yeah.,ross
15531," You wanna see her again, right?",joey
15532, Yeah.,ross
15533, So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!,joey
15534," Yeah, okay you're right.",ross
15535, Yeah.,joey
15536," I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?",ross
15537, Yeah!,joey
15538," It's, uh... it's endearing, really.",ross
15539, All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig!  Oink!,joey
15540," Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.",chandler
15541, Any luck?,rachel
15542," Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called ""Invisible things for Kathy.""  Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?",chandler
15543," All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.",rachel
15544," She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.",chandler
15545," Aw, honey, that's so sweet.",rachel
15546, Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?,chandler
15547, Oh! Pathetic! ,rachel
15548,  Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!,joey
15549, Where?,chandler
15550," Our place, the hall! I...",joey
15551, I got something for her.  It's a book!,chandler
15552,  A book?  Is it like a book that's also a safe?,joey
15553," No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?",chandler
15554," You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one.  Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?",joey
15555," No, it came out to an even twenty.",chandler
15556, Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.,joey
15557," You didn't get the money, did you?",phoebe
15558," Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!",monica
15559," No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough!  Hey, widow?",phoebe
15560," Okay, Widow!",phoebe
15561," Excuse me. Excuse me!  Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.",phoebe
15562, Good. ,phoebe
15563, I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.,monica

15569, I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!,rachel
15570," Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!",rachel

15572, Thanks!,rachel
15573," Oh, that's great! Congratulations!",monica
15574," Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?",rachel
15575," Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.",monica
15576, Yeah. I'm a hard ass.,phoebe
15577, And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.,monica
15578, Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!,phoebe
15579," Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!",monica
15580, Okay!,phoebe

15601," Uh, the book?",chandler
15602, What do you mean?,chandler
15603,"  Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, ""Uhl, ell.""",chandler

15606,"  Hey, that coupon expires, you know.",joey

15609, No?,monica
15610,  I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!,chandler
15611," Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a big surprise.",ross
15612," It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she’s smooth! Smooth! ",chandler
15613, Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?,phoebe
15614," Great! All right, so I’ll call you later.",joey
15615,  Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?,chandler

15617," Goin’ out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didn’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.",chandler
15618," No, things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.",joey
15619,  What?,chandler
15620, Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! ,joey
15621, Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!,chandler
15622, Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?,joey
15623," Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having s*x with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. ",chandler
15624, What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive.,joey
15625," Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.",chandler
15626, You got all that from the back of her head?,joey
15627," All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.",chandler
15628, Who’s Elaine?,joey
15629,"  ""Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease…"" Darn it! Now, I don’t know who to get to the next verse.",phoebe
15630," Oh, you could just go uh, ""greatest of ease…  BAH-bah-bha-bhannn."" Then go right into it.",ross
15631," Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’",phoebe

15806," Is that why you bought all this stuff?!  Well, y’know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I’m not gonna eat! You know why?!",joey
15807, Probably because…,chandler
15808," Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I’m not happy about you either.  Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. ",joey
15809," Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.",phoebe

15830, Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?,ross
15831, You shouldn’t.,rachel
15832," Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who.",phoebe

15838, I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!,phoebe

15840," Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it’s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let’s trade!",phoebe
15841," Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it…  Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it…  Her initials…",chandler
15842, Ohh.,phoebe

15858," Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.",rachel
15859," No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend!",monica
15860, He’s really picky about his patients.,chandler
15861," Honey, you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?",phoebe
15862, Like I remember his office number!  Speed dial 7.,monica
15863,"  Hi! Yeah, I’m calling on behalf of Monica Geller’s eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today.   He’s out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?",phoebe
15864, Yes!!,monica
15865, Yes! She’s very excited about that.,phoebe
15866," This is so cool, ‘til Monica gets back, it’s like I’m head chef and I get to make all the decisions. ",phoebe
15867," Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!",ross
15868," Okay, get out of my kitchen!",phoebe
15869,"  All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once!  I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.",chandler
15870, All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.,phoebe
15871," So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.",ross
15872," Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.",chandler
15873," Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice, what are you gonna get me?",ross

15875," Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.",ross
15876," Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.",chandler
15877," Oh, that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.",ross
15878, Like?,chandler
15879," Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.",ross
15880, When was the last time you saw her wear it?,chandler
15881," Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh…",ross
15882, Big dog?,chandler

15888, No! I’m putting that in my room.,joey
15889," Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?",ross
15890," Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?",joey
15891," That’s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?",ross
15892, Five years.,joey
15893, You’ve sentenced him?!,ross
15894, Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.,joey
15895," Joey, the guy’s your best friend.",ross

16191, I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro’s.,monica

16193," It’s okay, ‘cause y'know what? You don’t really need me for the business.",monica
16194, You’re the cook! With out you it’s just me driving up to people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!,phoebe
16195," All right. But umm, I-I-I’ll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.",monica

16267," Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung.",rachel
16268," Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas.",joey
16269," Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?",chandler
16270," Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve been single. How come you never offered this before?",rachel

16278," Hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘Quiet, bitch.’",phoebe
16279," Hey, honey! What’s the matter?  Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!",rachel
16280, I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. ,monica
16281, Ohhh!,joey
16282," I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting for my whole life.",monica
16283," Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell at them? Or, fire them?",rachel
16284," I would love too, but I can’t! I mean I just can’t, you know that I’m not good at confrontation.",monica
16285," Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.",chandler
16286," Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?",joey
16287," That’s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?",monica
16288, Good enough to get fired.,joey
16289," All right, you’re hired!",monica
16290, Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?,joey

16295,"  Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",chandler
16296," Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!",chandler

16338, You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?,ross
16339, Yeah.,chandler
16340," Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not fun.",ross
16341," If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?",phoebe
16342," Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.",ross
16343,  Hey!,joey
16344, Hey!,ross
16345," Hey, man!",chandler
16346," Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?",phoebe

16357," Well, like father, like son.",chandler
16358, Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.,rachel
16359, Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.,chandler
16360," Well, y'know, possibly.  You didn’t tell him that, though? Right?",rachel
16361," Ummmmmmmm, no.",chandler
16362, You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!,rachel
16363, Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see.,chandler
16364," Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh, he’s so gonna get the wrong idea.",rachel
16365," Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",monica
16366," Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",joey
16367,  There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks in this one!,joey
16368," Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?",monica
16369, Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,monica
16370," Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here’s the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm,  tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere…",monica
16371,"  A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here.  From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!!  Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!",monica
16372, No ma’am.,joey
16373, What the hell happened?!,monica
16374," I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, ""Wow! It’s been a long time since I had…  327 + 238 dollars!""",joey
16375," Joey, we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’ve got to fire you!",monica
16376," And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nice things I’ve been saying about you.",joey
16377, What kinda things have you been saying?,monica
16378," Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.",joey
16379,"  Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry…",phoebe

16387," The one with the cat. I gotta go, I’ve got another date.",ross
16388," So, did you pick one yet?",phoebe
16389," No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.",ross
16390," Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re done!",phoebe
16391," Y’know, you’re right. Thank you.",ross
16392," Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.",phoebe
16393, Prague?,chandler
16394, There’s sooo much you don’t know.,phoebe
16395," Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?",rachel
16396, I did! I absolutely did!,chandler
16397, You idiot!!,rachel
16398," I’m sure you’re right, but why?",chandler
16399, You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!,rachel
16400," Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry.",chandler
16401," Y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!",rachel
16402, I know! I know!,chandler
16403," Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks! ",rachel

16419, That’s not funny.,monica
16420,"  I’m a good person. And I’m a good chef, and I don’t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y’know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is…",monica
16421,  Hey! Chef Geller! Y’know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!,joey
16422, You do?,monica
16423," You bet I do! I just ah, wasn’t listening then, that’s all.",joey
16424, Well if you want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!,monica
16425, What are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?,joey
16426, You bet your ass I’m gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!!  All right! Anybody else got a problem? How ‘bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?,monica
16427, How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it’s funny now?,monica

16439, My little brother is married!,phoebe
16440," You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?",phoebe
16441," Wait, wait. Why were you at the courthouse?",phoebe
16442," Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother. Now I have a sister too!",phoebe
16443, Okay. Okay. Stop it. Don't!,phoebe
16444," So, ooh, I'm going to get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?",phoebe
16445," That's a really *nice* gift. I was thinking of, like, a gravy boat.",phoebe
16446, Check it out! Check it out! Guess what job I got? [smoothes the blue blazer he's wearing and has a big grin on his face],joey
16447," I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black. [stops]",chandler

16454," Oh, tour guide at the Museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.",joey
16455, Don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?,rachel
16456," No, not really. They give you all the information. It's like memorizing a script. [demonstrates] ""And on your left, you have Tyrannsoarus rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.""",joey
16457," Uh, actually Joey, it's the Cretaceous period.",ross
16458," Yeah, but I can pronounce ""Jurassic"".",joey

16468, Oh.,joey
16469, What did you tell them?,monica

16471, You're going to carry their child and get them a Sony Play Station?,chandler
16472," Honey, this is really an incredible thing to do for them but there are things to think about.",rachel
16473," Yeah, I mean you'd be pregnant. I mean, pregnant.",monica
16474, I know.,phoebe

16476," Yeah, what's your point? [goes to sit on the couch]",phoebe
16477, The stuff I just mentioned.,ross
16478," Wow, I don't know if I could ever do that. You know, I always figured the first time I had a baby, it would be with someone I love and that baby would be like, a keeper.",rachel
16479," You know, you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.",phoebe
16480," Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.",joey
16481, We just want you to think it through.,monica
16482, Why don't you talk to someone who's had a baby. Like your mom.,rachel
16483," My mom never gave birth. Oh, but my birth mom did!",phoebe
16484," Oh, yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway. It came with the pants.",chandler
16485," I am so jealous. You guys are just, really, right *there*, aren't you?",rachel

16487," In the beginning, you know, where it's all s*x and talking and s*x and talking...",monica
16488," Yeah, you've, you've got to love the talking.",chandler
16489, And the s*x?,monica
16490," Oh, we haven't had s*x yet. Okay, but what's the big deal, you know? This is special, and I want our love to grow, before we move to the next level.",chandler
16491," Chandler, that is so nice.",rachel
16492," Yeah, that is nice......lying!! No way is that the reason.",ross
16493," Why, just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?",rachel
16494," No, he's right, I'm totally lying.",chandler
16495, Then what is it?,monica
16496," Well, Kathy's last girlfriend was Joey.",chandler
16497, And you're afraid you won't be able to *fill his shoes*. [grins],ross
16498," No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.",chandler
16499," [stops grinning] Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",ross
16500, Yes and I was saying the actual words.,chandler
16501," Big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends. That doesn't mean he's good in bed.",monica
16502, We share a wall. So either he's great in bed or she just liked to agree with him a lot.,chandler
16503," Sweetie, with you it's going to be different. The s*x is going to be great 'cause you guys are in love.",monica
16504, Yeah?,chandler
16505, Yeah.,rachel
16506, Just go for it Chandler.,ross
16507," [gets up to leave] All right, all right, I'll sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys. [leaves]",chandler

16510, [waves back and takes something  from his hand and pretends to make it disappear in his ear. He then makes it appear from his mouth.],ross
16511," Okay, moving right along. [moves group away] Come on.",joey

16522, Okay. [puts the puppy in her lap and tries not to play with it.],phoebe
16523, [sighs softly],phoebe
16524, [playing with puppy again] Mom: I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.,phoebe
16525," All right, it's okay.",phoebe
16526," Oh, uh, would you mind sitting here? [gesturing across from him] I'm saving this seat for my friend Ross.",joey
16527, Doctor? I didn't know he had a nickname.,joey
16528," Well, uh, how come?",joey
16529, That's crazy.,joey
16530," I, I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables but Ross is one of my best friends. If I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it.",joey
16531," Ross, Ross, over here man. [gestures beside him] I saved you a seat.",joey
16532," [puts his tray on the table with the other scientists. He looks at the scientists and then at Joey.] That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later.",ross
16533," [enters] Hey.  Listen, I'm really really sorry about what happened today in the cafeteria.",ross
16534," It's no big deal you know. You do what you gotta do, right?",joey
16535, It's not just me. The scientists and the tour guides *never* sit together.,ross
16536, [looks at him for a second and then gets up to throw his garbage away.] Whatever.,joey
16537," It's like that everywhere Joey. Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work, the waiters eat with the other waiters and the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?",ross
16538, I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me. [Rachel puts her arm consolingly around Monica],monica
16539," Look, Ross, really, it's no big deal. You know, you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then, so be it. I understand. When I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So, you know, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow. [leaves]",joey
16540," Yeah, when we're in the audience, he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.",rachel
16541, [enters] Hey. Why's Phoebe singing to Karl Malden?,chandler
16542," Oh, you know what? I think it's time for the puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go on the balcony. [gets up with puppy]",phoebe
16543, What?,monica
16544," Uh, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. [to everyone] Oh, listen, don't go on the balcony until I get back. [leaves]",phoebe
16545," [to Chandler] So, did you do it?",monica
16546," [dejectedly] Yes, yes, we had the s*x.",chandler
16547," Uh-oh, was it bad?",monica
16548," It was fine, you know, but she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, uh, ""Oh, I see your point. I'm all right with it.""",chandler

16884," Oh my God, are you out of a job?",monica
16885," No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!",rachel
16886, Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?,phoebe
16887, Uh-huh.,rachel
16888, That sounds great!,phoebe
16889,  Hey! ,joey
16890," Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.",monica
16891,  There’s gravy?,joey
16892," If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now. ",monica
16893, What are you doing?,monica
16894, I think I left a donut up here.,joey
16895, Hey!,ross
16896, Hey!,phoebe
16897, Hey!,joey
16898, Ooh! How was Kathy’s play?,phoebe
16899," Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates s*x with a real good lookin’ guy.",ross
16900," Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!",chandler
16901, That’s a good idea for a business!,phoebe
16902," I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like, ""So where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?"" And she’ll go, ""No-no-no, it’s Chandler."" And he’ll go, ""Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!""",chandler
16903,  That-that is a good trick.,joey
16904," All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?",chandler
16905," Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them.",joey
16906," Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.",ross
16907, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.,joey
16908, Yeah.,ross
16909," Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.",phoebe
16910, They’re not a couple!,ross
16911," Oh-okay, I get the game now.",phoebe
16912," Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?",joey
16913, Oh yeah!,ross
16914," Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.",joey
16915, Really?,chandler
16916," Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?",joey
16917, No.,ross
16918, Noooo!!,joey
16919," So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?",chandler
16920," Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the s*x is between some guy and your girlfriend.",ross
16921," Yeah, I know but…",chandler
16922," Oh no-no-no, I’m there.",ross
16923,  Hey!,monica

16926, Yep! Grab a plate.,joey
16927, Okay. ,monica
16928," No-no, stay right there.  Gettin’ closer.",joey
16929," Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.",chandler
16930," Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.",joey
16931, Oh yeah!,ross
16932," Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",monica
16933," Oh yeah, who’s playing?",joey
16934, The players.,monica
16935, Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.,ross
16936,"  Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.",monica
16937," All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!",joey
16938, Oh. ,phoebe
16939,"  Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it!  I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now!  Yes I am!

16946," Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way. ",rachel
16947," I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!",chandler
16948," All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.",ross
16949," Come on, it was like cousins having s*x up there!",chandler
16950," Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t be…y'know you.",ross
16951, Hey!,ross
16952," Oh, absolutely! ",ross
16953," Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having s*x with him.",chandler
16954," Okay, I… ",ross
16955," Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!",chandler
16956," Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.",chandler
16957," Well, you can understand, given how we started.",chandler
16958," Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this!",chandler
16959," Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!",chandler
16960," I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!",rachel
16961, Rachel has a new doll.,phoebe
16962," Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.",rachel
16963," Uh, hello!",ross

16982," No, wait, please don’t go! I’ve got p0rn for you too!",monica
16983," Yeah, I don’t need it.",phoebe
16984, People are supposed to wanna hang out here!,monica
16985," Why? Honey, what is the big deal?",rachel
16986," I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.",monica
16987," Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?",phoebe
16988," ‘Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I’m-I’m done now. They’ve suffered enough.",monica
16989," If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out here!",phoebe
16990," Yeah, that’s true.",rachel
16991," All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s gonna be ten times better than that place!",monica
16992," Oh, are we gonna trash that place?",phoebe
16993, Steps!  Slut!  You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!,chandler

17010," Oh, yeah, totally! That’s such a turn-on!",joey
17011, Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?,rachel
17012," Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on.",joey
17013, He just got a divorce right?,phoebe
17014, Hmm-mmm.,rachel
17015," So he’s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.",phoebe
17016," Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before.",rachel
17017,  You’ve never asked a guy out?!!,phoebe
17018, No. Have you?,rachel
17019, Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?,phoebe
17020, I don’t even know how I would go about it.,rachel
17021," Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, ""Hey, how you doin’?""",joey
17022," Oh, please!",phoebe
17023,"  Hey, how you doin’?",joey
17024," You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, and I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out.  How you doin’?  Hi! Joshua? It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s.  Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we— the license? Well, that is a good idea!

You’ve done that a thousand times?",rachel
17025, I’ve never done that.,phoebe
17026," Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.",rachel
17027," Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!",joey
17028, Really?! You think that will work?,rachel
17029," Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?",joey
17030, What the heck is that?,joey
17031, Did she call?,chandler

17039," Dude, tell me she actually told you this.",joey
17040," She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!",chandler
17041, That’s all you’re basing this on?,ross
17042," That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.",chandler
17043," Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.",joey
17044, Oh my God!!,chandler
17045," Would you like to go to a basketball game with me?  You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too…  Umm, who likes the Knicks—",rachel

17055, Really?,rachel

17057," Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y’know, I know for me— Nick’s pants?",chandler
17058," Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!",chandler
17059," Okay, for next time, what do you say?",joey
17060," I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.",rachel
17061," So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?",ross
17062," He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got the date, I’m just not on it!",rachel
17063,"  Okay, it’s ready. Come on.",monica

17081, Oh good!,phoebe
17082, She is now.,chandler
17083, What are you saying?,ross
17084," I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.",chandler
17085, How? How is your fault?,phoebe
17086," Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!",chandler
17087," Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.",rachel
17088," Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…",ross
17089, Really?,rachel
17090," Yes! I will! Absolutely!  Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I’m glad. Rachel, I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?",rachel

What are you doing with your life?""",joey
17100," You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here. Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you.  Well, except you. ",chandler

17186, What?,monica
17187, Why?,phoebe

17189," Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?",phoebe
17190," No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, ""I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!"" and he let her right in.",rachel
17191, So you hit her in the face?,monica
17192," No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.",rachel

17558," We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua.  Look, he said he’s not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! ",rachel
17559," Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no party.",ross

17629," Well, I eat a lot of meat right?",joey
17630, Yeah.,phoebe

17632," Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me.",phoebe
17633," Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?",joey
17634," Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.",ross
17635, Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?,monica
17636," No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.",rachel

17710, Do we pay for this?,chandler
17711," No, we didn’t even pay our cable bill—maybe this is how they punish us.",joey
17712, Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill—free phone s*x.,chandler
17713, Maybe we shouldn’t pay our gas bill? ,joey
17714," Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!",chandler

17747, Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!,monica
17748, You had fantasies about Emily?,ross
17749," No! Y’know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.",monica
17750, Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?,ross
17751," Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!",monica

17755, You love her!,monica
17756, What-what is love really?,ross
17757," Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to the gate. You’re gonna call out her name and say, ""I love you!"" And she’s gonna say, ""I love you, too!"" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.",monica
17758, I am a good kisser.,ross

17760, Is that the heartbeat?,rachel
17761, Oh my God!,phoebe

17811, What?,chandler
17812, You know!,monica
17813, Okay.  Good one.,chandler
17814," It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn’t, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go! ",monica
17815," Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y’know just to she what’s going on, and, and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t. Then it’s over.",ross

18053, Huh.,rachel
18054, What?,ross
18055," She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.",rachel
18056, This totally makes sense!,monica
18057, It does not!,ross
18058," Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!",monica

18071, You’re actually going through with this?,phoebe
18072," Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.",chandler
18073," You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact—yes,  I’m, I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.",phoebe

19109," Yeah, I do. What’s the matter?",phoebe
19110, I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.,rachel
19111," Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married…",phoebe
19112,  Still in love with?!,rachel
19113, Yeah!,phoebe
19114, I’m not in love with Ross!,rachel
19115," Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.",phoebe
19116," Phoebe, I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I’m still in love with him! I mean, hey, y’know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y’know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don’t mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him. Y’know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him—Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my—why didn’t you tell me?!!",rachel
19117, We thought you knew!,phoebe
19118, We?!,rachel
19119," Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!",phoebe
19120, You all know? Does Ross know?,rachel
19121," Oh no, Ross doesn’t know anything.",phoebe
19122," Oh, I can not believe you didn’t tell me!",rachel
19123," Well, because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean.""",phoebe
19124, Hey!,joey
19125, Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?,joey
19126," Well, I don’t have to buy that, ""I’m with stupid"" T-shirt anymore.",chandler
19127," Well, I like it. Here you go. ",joey
19128," All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?",chandler
19129," Oh, I embarrass you?",joey
19130, How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?,chandler
19131, Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?,chandler
19132," All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.",chandler
19133, Oh yeah?  If you’re gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.,joey
19134, Thanks.,joey
19135," Okay, wait. All right, that’s it, okay, I’m out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore! ",chandler
19136," Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.",ross
19137, Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?,ross
19138, She said what?,ross
19139," Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?  This isn’t right.",ross
19140, I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? ,ross
19141, The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married.,ross
19142, No. I’m saying it’s now. ,ross
19143, There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!,ross
19144,"  No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please—",ross
19145, Hey!,phoebe
19146,  Hi.,rachel
19147," So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?",phoebe
19148, Manhattan does not have enough stores.,rachel

19150, You can?,rachel

19152, Um-hmm.,rachel
19153, And a small piece of chocolate.,phoebe
19154, Okay.,rachel
19155, And a glass of tepid water. ,phoebe
19156," Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?",rachel
19157," Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn’t feel like getting up. Okay, I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you’re going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.",phoebe
19158, I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.,rachel
19159," Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he’s such a great guy. Here.  Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you’re with Ross okay and imagine that you’re kissing him. And you’re-you’re running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it’s some kind of grease, it’s—uck! Hah?",phoebe
19160," I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.",rachel
19161," Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let’s try some uh, aversion therapy.",phoebe
19162, Okay.,rachel
19163, Okay?,phoebe
19164, All right.,rachel
19165," So uh, now look at the picture…",phoebe

19172, Hey. ,chandler
19173, Oh.  Sorry!,joey
19174," No-no-no, y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I’ve had a really lousy day.",chandler
19175, Me too.,joey
19176, Yeah?,chandler
19177," Noo!! I’ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!",joey

19192, I’m gonna go to the bathroom.,chandler
19193, Wait up! ,joey
19194," Hey-hey, since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady, here’s a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding at all?",ross
19195, She said that?!,monica
19196, Yeah.,ross
19197, Why?!,monica
19198," I don’t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.",ross
19199, Oh my God. You’re even dumber than I am!,monica
19200, Excuse me?,ross
19201," Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?",monica
19202, I don’t know. A month?,ross
19203," Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That’s what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top.  Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.",monica
19204," I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.",ross
19205, Sometimes we were.,monica
19206, Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?,ross
19207, Okay.,monica
19208, Come on. ,ross

19211,  I hope he did!,chandler
19212, Hello.,phoebe

19214," Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi!’ but then I figured, he doesn’t care if he looks like you.",phoebe
19215," That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?",joey
19216," Ohh, they’re having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn’t been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?",phoebe

20035,"  That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?",rachel
20036," Uh-huh, that one!",monica
20037," Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail.  Maybe that's him. ",rachel
20038,"  Okay, umm, okay, umm…  It's just Joey and Ross.",monica
20039, Why aren't you guys at the movie?,rachel
20040," Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!",joey
20041, I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!,ross
20042,  He's talking to London!,joey
20043, But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?,monica
20044," Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.",joey
20045,"  I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!",ross
20046, Ross! Way to suck up to the family.,joey

20055," Ugh, PBS!",phoebe
20056, What's wrong with PBS?,monica
20057," Ugh, what's right with them?",phoebe
20058," Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs?",joey
20059," Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.",phoebe
20060, Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.,chandler
20061, All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!,phoebe
20062," I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.",joey
20063," This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.",phoebe
20064," Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!",joey
20065, What-what are you talking about?!,phoebe
20066," Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?",joey
20067, Yeah. So?,phoebe
20068," It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.",joey
20069, Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.,phoebe
20070," Well, may I ask for one example?",joey
20071," Yeah, it's… Y'know there's—no you may not!",phoebe
20072, That's because all people are selfish.,joey
20073, Are you calling me selfish?!,phoebe
20074," Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?",joey
20075," I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.",phoebe
20076,  Hello.,ross
20077," Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily!  It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst!  Hi!",ross
20078," No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!",ross
20079, Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.,ross
20080,  She's talking.,ross
20081," Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?",phoebe
20082, That he doesn't exist.,joey
20083, Right. ,phoebe
20084," So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",rachel
20085," Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",chandler
20086," So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",rachel
20087," Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",monica
20088," Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",chandler
20089, I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best s*x she ever had!,rachel
20090, Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?,chandler
20091, I might've said that.  Why is that funny?,monica
20092," Because I'm very happy for him!  And you, you lucky dog!",chandler
20093,  Hi!,ross
20094, Hey!,monica
20095," Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.",ross

20099, What?!,monica
20100, She wants me to move to London.,ross
20101, But you live here!  You know that.,monica
20102, What-what-what are you gonna do?,rachel
20103, I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.,ross
20104," Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.",monica
20105, It could happen.,ross
20106,  How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!,joey
20107," That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.",joey
20108, But I'm the host!,joey
20109," You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.",joey
20110," I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!",phoebe
20111, Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.,rachel
20112, I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!,phoebe
20113,"  Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?",chandler
20114, Sure!,monica
20115," If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?",chandler
20116, Chandler!  Is he?,rachel
20117," Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.",monica
20118," Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. ",chandler
20119," All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.",ross
20120," Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?",ross
20121," Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.",ross
20122," All right, did you just say all right?",ross
20123," Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!",ross
20124," Yes, tell me.",ross
20125," I know. I am, I am so sorry.",ross
20126," Again, very sorry.",ross
20127," Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.",ross
20128, Oh that is so great! That's…,ross
20129," So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.",ross
20130, Yes!,chandler
20131, Ooh-ohh!,phoebe
20132, Great!,monica
20133, No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.,ross
20134, Why?,phoebe
20135, What?! You can't—what did you tell her?,monica
20136," I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!",ross
20137," Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.",chandler
20138," Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.",monica
20139, Yeah.,phoebe
20140, That's true!,chandler
20141," Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.",phoebe
20142, That's true!,chandler
20143," No, you cannot.",monica
20144," Thanks for the help, problem solved. ",ross
20145,  Hello.,monica
20146,  Hey Mon!,joey
20147," Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?",monica
20148," See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.",joey
20149,  You're not on TV.,monica
20150," Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? ",joey
20151," Hey, there he is! There he is!",chandler

20158," William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.",monica

20160," Yeah, so?",monica
20161," Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.",chandler
20162," Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.",monica
20163, Why?,chandler
20164, Why? ,monica
20165, What's your point?,chandler
20166,  PBS telethon.,joey
20167,"  Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.",phoebe
20168, What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?,joey
20169," Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.",phoebe
20170," Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.",joey
20171,"  Aw, dammit! ",phoebe
20172," Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?",joey
20173, Come on man! You've been here all day!,joey
20174,"  Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. ",ross
20175," A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!",monica
20176," Ooh, it's not a toy.",phoebe
20177," Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.  Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?  Ask again later. Later is not good enough.  Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!",ross
20178," All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have s*x tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.",monica
20179,  PBS Telethon.,joey
20180,  Hi Joey.,phoebe
20181, Hey Pheebs!,joey
20182, I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.,phoebe
20183," $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?",joey
20184," Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.",phoebe
20185, And you don't a little good about donating the money?,joey
20186," No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.",phoebe
20187," A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.",joey
20188," Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.",phoebe
20189," Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel—Oh no! ",phoebe

20206, For what?,ross
20207, For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.,rachel

20213," Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.",rachel
20214," No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.",ross
20215," Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to… Hi!",rachel
20216, Thanks.,ross
20217," Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it.  I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't.  Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!",rachel
20218,"  Hello.  Hi sweetie.  Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it.  So will you come to New York? ",ross

20237," Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.",monica
20238, I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.,chandler
20239,  Hey.,ross

20266," Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?",monica
20267,"  Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.",joey

20351," Hey, how was your chef thing?",joey
20352," Oh, it was awful.  I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.",monica
20353," Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.",chandler
20354, Chandler! ,monica
20355, Monica. ,chandler
20356," Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.",monica
20357," Okay, fine, $300.",chandler
20358, 300 dollars?!,monica
20359," Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!",chandler
20360, Urghh!!,monica
20361,  What are you guys woofing about?,joey
20362, Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!,monica
20363," Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!",joey
20364, You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.,ross
20365, You want my advice?,joey
20366, Yes! Please!,ross
20367, You're not gonna like it.,joey

20371, I told ya.,joey
20372, I'm going to the bathroom. ,ross
20373," Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.",joey
20374, Maybe I could do it.,monica
20375,  Hi!,rachel
20376," Hi, Rach.",joey
20377, Hi!,chandler
20378, Hey.,phoebe
20379, Hey.,monica
20380," Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?",rachel
20381," I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there. ",joey
20382, That's not Ross!,rachel
20383, Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.,phoebe
20384," Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.",chandler

20387,  Do you even know who Kip is?,rachel
20388, Who cares? You're Rachel!  Who's Kip?,joey

20390," Oh, that poor b*st*rd.",joey
20391," See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!",rachel
20392, You're not gonna be phased out!,monica
20393," Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother.  He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.",rachel
20394, Ehh!!,phoebe
20395," Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.",rachel
20396,  Hey!,chandler
20397," Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.",joey
20398, Yes that was mine.,chandler
20399, 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.,joey
20400, Yes that would have made more sense.,chandler
20401," Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.  Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!",joey
20402, Phoebe?  I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing.  You gotta come with me!,rachel
20403, Come where?,phoebe
20404," Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.",rachel
20405," Okay, but try and get Joey too.",phoebe
20406,"  Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?",ross
20407," Oh, sure!  Bye Ross!  Forever.",phoebe
20408, Hi.,ross
20409, Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?,rachel
20410," I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.",ross
20411," Oh, Ross…",rachel
20412," No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?",ross
20413," No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.",rachel
20414," Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?",ross
20415," Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!",rachel
20416, I can't believe this is happening.,ross
20417, I know.,rachel
20418, I am so sorry.,ross
20419, I know that too.,rachel
20420,"   Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.",joey
20421,  Hey!,chandler
20422, Hi.,monica
20423," I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?",chandler
20424," Yeah, it did.",monica
20425," So, I guess this is over.",chandler
20426, What?,monica
20427," Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.",chandler
20428," Why, exactly?",monica
20429," Because of the weekend, we had a fight.",chandler
20430, Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh! ,monica
20431," So, this isn't over?",chandler
20432,"  You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.",monica
20433, Really? Okay. Great!,chandler
20434," Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! ",monica
20435,  We're in a relationship?,chandler

20449,  You?!  And-and you?!,joey
20450," Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!",monica
20451, How?! When?!,joey
20452, It happened in London.,chandler
20453, IN LONDON!!!,joey
20454, The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.,chandler
20455, But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!,joey
20456, No-no-no-no-no! You can't!,chandler
20457," Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.",monica
20458," All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but…",joey
20459," I know, it's great!",monica
20460," Aww, I don't want to see that!",joey
20461, We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!,phoebe
20462," The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, ""Hi, Phoebe!""",phoebe
20463," Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.",monica
20464, Count for what?,phoebe
20465, Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.,monica
20466, I guess I'm done.,joey
20467, Fun's over!,chandler
20468," Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!",monica
20469, Uh-huh!,rachel
20470, I think I'm gonna take-off.,joey
20471," Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun!  Ohhh! ",monica
20472,"  Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!",joey
20473, What?!,monica
20474," Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.",joey
20475, Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?,chandler
20476," Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman!  And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.",joey
20477, Sorry.,monica
20478, Sorry.,chandler
20479,  I can hear that!,joey
20480,  Rachel's at work.,monica
20481, I can still hear you!,joey
20482, Hey!,phoebe
20483, Hey!,joey
20484, Hello!,chandler
20485," Hey, what's that?",monica
20486," Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.",phoebe
20487, Eeeee--ohh!! God! ,phoebe
20488," Argh-argh!!  Ooh, soft. Is this mink?",joey
20489," Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!",phoebe
20490," Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn't happen, I made that up!",chandler
20491,  Hey!,ross
20492, How come? Everybody else does.,ross
20493, What is that?,monica
20494," Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.",ross
20495,  This is all of your things.,monica
20496," Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's—Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.",ross
20497," So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.",monica
20498, Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.,ross
20499," Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?",joey
20500," Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.",ross
20501," Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?",chandler
20502, After what I did? Can you blame her?,ross
20503," Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.",phoebe
20504,"  What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?",joey
20505, Now calm down Joey.,monica
20506," No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!",joey
20507," Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.",phoebe
20508," Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence…",chandler
20509," Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?",monica
20510," No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.",joey
20511," Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?",rachel
20512," Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.",monica
20513, I want the little round waffles.,rachel
20514," All right.  Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?",monica
20515," Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!",rachel
20516, Arghhhh!!!!!!,rachel
20517, Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!,monica
20518, I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.,phoebe
20519, I'll take it!,joey
20520, That might work! ,phoebe
20521," Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  Enh? All right, what do you think?",joey
20522, You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.,chandler
20523,"  No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden.  No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. ",ross
20524, What's the matter Ross?,joey
20525," Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!",ross
20526, Why?,phoebe
20527," Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.",ross
20528, That's way uptown! That's like three trains away!  Which is great! I love to ride that rail!,joey
20529, So you're really okay with this?,chandler
20530," Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!",ross
20531," Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.",chandler
20532," Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him?  Ow!! He's not even here!!!",joey
20533, You guys! You guys!,rachel
20534," We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!",monica
20535," It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!",rachel
20536," And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!",monica
20537,"  Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!",rachel
20538," Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?",joey
20539, Yeah!,rachel
20540," Yeah, you fogged Danny.",joey
20541, Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?,rachel
20542," Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.",joey
20543," Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!",monica
20544," Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.",rachel
20545, We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.,monica
20546," Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.",rachel
20547," Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.",rachel
20548, Yeah.,monica
20549, Wow! That guy is so rude!,monica
20550, Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.,rachel
20551, Well you did a little bit.,monica
20552," Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!",rachel
20553, I totally forgive you!,monica
20554, Really?,rachel
20555, Yes!,monica
20556, Hey!,phoebe
20557, Hey!,monica
20558," So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?",phoebe
20559, Crematorium Chris? Sure!,monica
20560," He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.",phoebe
20561," Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!",rachel
20562," Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.",monica
20563," What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!",rachel
20564," This is fashion?!  Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny.  Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good?  'Cause I do.",phoebe
20565,  I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye. ,ross
20566," Okay, what is in here? Rocks?",chandler
20567," No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.",ross
20568," So, rocks.",chandler
20569," I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there. ",ross
20570," Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?",joey
20571," I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.",ross
20572," Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?",joey
20573," Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…",ross
20574," You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!",joey
20575, Why?,ross
20576," It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.",joey
20577, What's going on?,ross
20578, We all hate Emily!,joey
20579, Nooo!!,phoebe
20580," No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.",monica
20581, Yeah!,joey
20582," Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.",chandler
20583, Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!,joey
20584," Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do! ",ross
20585, I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.,phoebe
20586," God, I feel so guilty about Ross.",monica
20587," Oh, I know.",phoebe
20588, I kinda feel like it's my fault.,joey
20589, Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.,chandler
20590," Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! ",joey
20591," Well, I think it's very brave what you said.",chandler
20592," All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. ",phoebe
20593," Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?",chandler
20594," Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I—it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley!  Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!",phoebe
20595, Hi!,rachel
20596, What? Yeti—I mean Danny?,rachel
20597," Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so…. Y'know.",rachel
20598,  What?,rachel
20599, What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!,rachel
20600," So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!",rachel
20601," Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.",rachel
20602, And stop saying that! I hate that!,rachel
20603, Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?,rachel
20604, What?!,rachel
20605, Okay. Okay.,rachel
20606," Uh, Ross?",chandler
20607, Are you still mad at us?,phoebe
20608, Yep.,ross
20609," Oh good! Because we have an ""I'm sorry"" song.",phoebe
20610, Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.,ross
20611," Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.",joey
20612," Yeah, we are so sorry.",chandler
20613,  You're kinda stepping on the song. ,phoebe
20614," Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.",joey
20615," Whatever you decide, whatever you do.",monica
20616," Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!",phoebe
20617," Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.",ross
20618, Yes! Exactly! And that's why…,phoebe
20619, Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.,monica
20620, Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?,ross
20621," Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!",phoebe
20622," Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.",joey
20623," You do, huh?",ross
20624," Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air.  Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone…",joey
20625, What are you talking about?,ross
20626,  I'm not sure.,joey
20627,  Hi!,rachel
20628," Hey, look at you! Where have you been?",monica
20629," Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.",rachel
20630, How did that happen?,monica
20631, That yeti is one smooth talker.,rachel
20632," I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.",monica
20633," Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.",rachel
20634," Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really… I don't mind.",rachel
20635, Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh… It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.,ross
20636," Ross, I…",rachel
20637, RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!,joey
20638," Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.",rachel

21363," Come on, hurry!",monica
21364," Hey, how do you spell suspicious?",joey

21430, Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.,ross
21431, Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.,joey

21433," I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.",ross
21434," Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.",joey
21435," The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.",chandler
21436, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!,ross
21437," Come on look guys, don't fight.",joey
21438," And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.",ross
21439," Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?",chandler
21440, If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.,ross
21441," Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!",joey
21442," How about we settle this right now!  There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!",ross

21475," I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?",ross
21476, Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!,chandler
21477," Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?",joey

21544," Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.",phoebe
21545, She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.,monica
21546," In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.",ross
21547," I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the ""new thing you do that day!""  And it starts right now!",chandler

21557," Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.",monica
21558, I don't gossip!,rachel
21559," Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?",rachel

21598, Yeah! ,joey
21599, I like them a lot.,monica
21600," That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight.  Maybe there's something in that area.",chandler

22473,"  Ugh, can you believe that guy!",ross
22474, Yeah. I really like his glasses.,phoebe

That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.",ross
22476,  Sounds like a fun party.,chandler
22477," Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.",rachel
22478, It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!,ross
22479," Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.",rachel

22481, And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.,rachel
22482," Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.",chandler
22483," Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.",rachel
22484, Wh-wh-why?!,chandler
22485," Well, because she loves you and because you love her.",rachel
22486," Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!",chandler
22487," Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.",rachel
22488," I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?",chandler
22489," No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.",rachel
22490," Okay. It's not different at all, is it?",chandler
22491, Not unless different means the same.,rachel
22492,"  Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.",joey
22493," Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.",joey
22494, Isn't this great?,monica
22495, Hmm.,chandler
22496, Couldn't you just stay like this forever?  Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?,monica
22497," Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. ",chandler
22498, Are you okay?,monica
22499," Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.",chandler
22500, What-what are you doing?,monica

22502," Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!",monica
22503, What?!,chandler
22504, Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.,monica
22505," Well, you do want all that stuff, right?",chandler
22506, Oh and you know what I want!,monica
22507, Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!,chandler
22508, I do not have baby fever!,monica
22509," Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!",chandler
22510," Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!",monica
22511, Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!,chandler
22512, You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! ,monica
22513," Well, I did not know that.",chandler
22514," It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.",chandler
22515, By me?,chandler
22516," Oh, no!",ross
22517, No-no.,joey
22518," Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.",ross
22519," Yeah, big!",joey
22520," Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.",joey
22521," Gunther, can I get a coffee  to go?",monica
22522, Monica. ,chandler

22524, Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.,chandler
22525, What?!,monica
22526," Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.",chandler
22527," Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one. ",monica
22528, Phoebe! ,ross
22529," Oh, hi Ross!",phoebe
22530, What are you doing?,ross

22534, Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!,ross
22535," Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.",phoebe
22536," Yeah, but you're making me look bad!",ross
22537, No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!,phoebe

22543," Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.",rachel
22544," Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?",joey
22545, Hey! Hiya!,joey
22546," Hey! Hey, cute jacket!",rachel
22547, Oh! Ow! ,rachel

22563, But somehow you came off as the bad guy.,phoebe
22564, What?!,ross
22565," Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.",phoebe
22566,"  Ohh, this cake is really good!",ross
22567," Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!",phoebe
22568," All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross?  Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, ""Who hear likes Ross,"" and he's wearing two nametags!  I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys   Gold-digger,  cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.",phoebe
22569," Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.",phoebe
22570," Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.",ross
22571, Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?,chandler
22572,  I'm Monica.,monica
22573," I need to talk to you, it's urgent!",chandler
22574, Okay.,monica
22575," Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. ",chandler
22576, Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!,monica
22577,  Monica…,chandler
22578," No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!",monica
22579, Will you marry me?,chandler
22580, Oh-no. No. No.,ross
22581, What a bad idea!,joey
22582," Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! ",rachel
22583," Chandler, why are you doing this?",monica
22584, I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.,chandler
22585, Chandler.,monica
22586, I'm doing this because I'm sorry?,chandler
22587," Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?",monica
22588," No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.  Will you be my wife?",chandler
22589,"  Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.",monica
22590," Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.",chandler
22591, Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!,monica
22592," Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. ",chandler
22593, Who? Two divorces and Joey?!,monica
22594, Hey!,ross
22595, She's right y'know.,joey
22596," Yeah, but still, cheap shot!",ross
22597," Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.",monica
22598, I didn't think I was!,chandler
22599," Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?",monica
22600," Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. ",chandler
22601," Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?",joey
22602," No, I will not!",ross
22603," Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.",joey
22604," You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?",ross
22605," Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.",phoebe
22606," Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?",rachel
22607," Okay, how long is this going to go on.",chandler
22608," Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.",monica
22609," This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole ""We were on a break thing?"" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? ",ross
22610, That's not funny.,chandler
22611, That's not funny at all!,joey
22612, Hey!,joey
22613, Hey!,chandler
22614, Hey!,monica
22615, What are you guys doing up?,joey

22617,  Dark red.,joey
22618," Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later.  Hey, how about maroon?",chandler
22619,"  Yes, you are so smart! ",monica
22620," Aww, you guys are so cute!",joey

22633, Wow!,monica
22634," Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts.  Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.",chandler
22635," Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.",rachel
22636," Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! ",phoebe
22637,"  Hey, you guys!",joey
22638, Hey!,chandler
22639, Hey Joey!,rachel

22643," Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I’m not him.",joey
22644," I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.",monica
22645, No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!,joey
22646, Are you saying I smell bad?,monica
22647," No! No, you smell like a meadow.  I'm sorry. ",joey
22648, What's with him?,monica
22649," Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.",chandler
22650,  Ugh!,rachel
22651,"  Yeah, I still don't know.  I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, ""Kids welcome here."" But that also says,  ""Come here to me!""",ross

22654," Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.",rachel
22655, Yeah?,ross
22656," Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!",ross
22657," Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!",rachel
22658," Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you!  All right Rach, let's go! ",ross
22659, Yeah!   Are you kiddin'?,rachel

22663," Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. ",ross
22664, Ross!,rachel
22665, What's that supposed to mean?,ross

22667," Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.",ross
22668, Yeah! Rach?,ross

22696, I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.,phoebe
22697," Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.",chandler
22698," You could get arrested, right now!  All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. ",phoebe
22699,  Hey.,phoebe
22700,  Hey!  Oh.,joey

22710," Well, it involved Monica.",joey
22711," You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!  I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.   Anyway we're talking about your dream.  I love you.  Your dream? ",chandler

22713, What was the dream about?,monica
22714," Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.",joey
22715," Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love with me!",monica
22716, It-it doesn’t?,joey
22717, No!,monica
22718," No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.",chandler
22719, That kinda sounds like your dream dude.,joey
22720," Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.",monica
22721, In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.,joey
22722, Um-hmm.,monica
22723," Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?",chandler
22724,  Not really.,joey
22725, Well there you have it!,chandler
22726," Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats!  But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!",monica
22727," No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?",joey
22728," Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?",chandler
22729, Friends first? That's interesting.,joey
22730, You become friends after?,monica
22731," No, never done that either.",joey
22732,"  Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?",rachel
22733," Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.",chandler

22738," Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.",phoebe
22739," Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop. ",phoebe
22740," Ohh, no.  Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4. ",phoebe
22741," I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.",phoebe
22742," I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.",phoebe

22748," Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?",rachel

22752, I know.,rachel
22753, Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.,joey
22754, What's up Joe?,rachel
22755," Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…",joey
22756, Yeah?,rachel
22757," …is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, ""Who are my friends?"" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So…",joey
22758,  What are you saying?,rachel
22759, I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.,joey
22760," Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.",rachel
22761, I'll treat you real nice. ,joey
22762,"  Yeah, well, y'know umm… No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!",rachel
22763, Won't-won't that take longer?,joey
22764," Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.",rachel
22765," Yeah. I understand. I understand.  Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!",joey
22766," Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.",ross

22805,"  Well look, hey, it's all your fault!",joey
22806, What?! Why?!,rachel
22807," Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!  And her roommate!",joey

22816," Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!",rachel
22817," Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you  with me.  Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler.  Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!",phoebe
22818, Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!,phoebe
22819, I would love it if I weren't here!,phoebe
22820, Me?!,phoebe

22980," Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah,  who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted s*x in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage.  Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  So she didn't want to sue him.   Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got  courage, you got integrity, you got  courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr…",rachel

23003, I feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore.,monica
23004, Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?,chandler
23005, Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?,monica
23006," Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.",chandler
23007, Really?,monica
23008," Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting. ",chandler
23009," That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.",monica
23010, Yeah?,chandler

23032,"  Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town!  Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!  I mean, way to go Ben!  Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.",joey

23055," All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.",ross
23056, It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.,monica

23069," Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad….",joey
23070," Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you, ",ross

23079," I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!",rachel
23080," Yeah, it is the best.",chandler
23081," I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?",rachel
23082," Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.",monica

23406, Well that's pathetic!,monica
23407, Again true.,chandler
23408, And this goes for all guys?,monica

23584," Yeah, no one talks like that!",ross
23585, Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!,joey
23586," Hey, I'm more cop than you two!",ross
23587, How do you figure that?,chandler
23588," Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!",ross

23596,  I know!,rachel
23597," Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!",monica
23598, What?! We can't do that!,rachel
23599," We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?",monica
23600, Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!,rachel
23601," I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?",monica
23602, I don't think he's the one who needs help.,rachel
23603," No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day.   Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?!  Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.",monica
23604, Ugh!,rachel
23605," Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.",monica
23606," Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen! ",rachel
23607, Noooooooo!,rachel
23608," Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!",chandler
23609, What is it?,ross
23610,"  Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.",chandler
23611, What? What? What? What is it?,ross
23612, Is everything okay?,joey
23613, What's going on?,chandler
23614,  You okay man?,joey

23620, Oh yeah right! ,monica
23621," No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!",rachel
23622, There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!,monica
23623, Yeah well unless we tell him.,rachel
23624," Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.",monica
23625," Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.",rachel
23626,"  Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! ",ross
23627, Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!,monica
23628, Right?,rachel
23629,  John Glenn is here?!,phoebe
23630," Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car…",ross
23631, Hi!,phoebe
23632," Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!",ross
23633," My God, Joey!",phoebe
23634,  It was a car backfire!,chandler
23635," Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!",ross
23636," Yeah, I didn't know that.",joey
23637, And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.,ross
23638, Who jumps at loud noises!,chandler
23639, Wow! I could've died tonight.,ross
23640," Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. ",chandler
23641, I do have a newfound respect for life.,ross
23642,  Oh my God! ,chandler
23643," Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.",phoebe
23644, Okay!,phoebe
23645, Bye!,phoebe
23646, Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!,joey
23647, Dude! How come you took off?,joey
23648," Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever…",chandler
23649, Is something wrong?,joey
23650," No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.",chandler
23651, Okay.,joey
23652, You dove in front of Ross! Ross!,chandler
23653," That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!",joey
23654, I do not hate Ross!,chandler
23655, Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.,joey
23656, What picture?,chandler
23657," I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!",joey
23658," Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!",chandler
23659," Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I…knew…you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!",joey
23660," When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.",chandler
23661," Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.",joey
23662, From a bullet!,chandler
23663, I know it doesn't make much sense…,joey
23664, Much sense?!,chandler
23665," Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!",joey
23666," So you risked your life, for a sandwich!",chandler
23667," I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!",joey
23668," So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.",chandler
23669, No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!,joey
23670, Really?!,chandler
23671," Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here.",joey
23672, Thanks. ,chandler
23673," No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!",joey
23674, How good is that?,joey
23675,"  Oh-oi-ho, yeah!",chandler
23676, See?,joey
23677, Hm-hmm. ,chandler
23678," Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!",joey
23679, I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.,chandler
23680, Yeah. With a bite!  Gee-e-e-eez!,joey
23681, Hey! Hi!,rachel
23682," Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?",ross
23683," Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!",rachel
23684," Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh! ",ross
23685," Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?",rachel
23686, The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!,ross
23687, What?! What? What happened?!,rachel
23688," Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?",ross
23689, Yeah!,rachel
23690, And somebody took a shot at me!,ross
23691,  Really?!,rachel
23692," No, a car backfired, but  I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I…I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.",ross
23693, Because a car backfired?,rachel
23694,"  Okay, why are you here?",ross
23695," Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole ""seizing"" thing but um, Emily called you today.",rachel
23696, You talked to her?,ross
23697," No, she left a message.   But it-it kinda got erased. There's just  something wrong with your machine.",rachel
23698," Well, okay, what-what did she say?",ross
23699," Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.",rachel
23700, Wow!,ross
23701," Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?",rachel
23702," Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!",ross
23703," Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me—not important. The point is, I was right. You're decision. Okay? I was right.   You're decision.",rachel
23704," Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.",ross
23705," Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?",rachel
23706," Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!",ross
23707," Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!",rachel
23708," You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?",ross
23709," Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.",rachel
23710, Huh.,ross
23711," I mean, look-look today you escaped   death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?",rachel
23712," That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.",ross
23713," Well, there you go!",rachel
23714," Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.",ross
23715,  Close call day.,rachel
23716," Hey, thanks Rach. ",ross
23717," Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. ",rachel
23718, Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.,ross
23719, Oh?,rachel
23720,"  ""Hey Ross, it's you!""  Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.",ross
23721, No. ,rachel
23722,"  Hey umm, was-was Monica here?",ross
23723, Yeah.,rachel
23724," Yeah, I want my money back.",ross
23725,"  Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?",rachel
23726," Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?",ross
23727," Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.",phoebe
23728," I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.",ross
23729," Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.",monica
23730, Before or after you were shot by your own troops?,chandler
23731, I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.,ross
23732," Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.",chandler
23733," Yeah, hero sandwiches. ",joey
23734," Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way.  But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all.   Not you Joey.",phoebe
23735," I'm fine, thanks.",phoebe
23736,"  Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?",chandler
23737, No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.,monica
23738, Okay.,chandler
23739, Hiya doin' pumpkin?,chandler
23740, Nope. ,phoebe
23741," So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?",monica
23742,  Oh my God!,monica
23743, I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?,monica
23744," I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral…",monica
23745, Okay. Bye!,phoebe
23746," So, what movie should we see?",phoebe
23747,  Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!,monica
23748, What?! Really?!,phoebe
23749," He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!",monica
23750, I can't believe this!,phoebe
23751,"  Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!",chandler
23752, Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!,monica
23753," Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! ",chandler
23754," No, but it is fast. Isn't it?",phoebe
23755, Ohhhh!,monica
23756," No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!",phoebe
23757," So, what are you gonna do?",chandler
23758, I don't know. I'll just handle it—I'll ask you to talk to him!,phoebe
23759, Me?! Why me?,chandler
23760," Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a…man!",phoebe
23761," I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.",chandler
23762, That is so sweet! ,monica
23763,"  Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem. ",chandler
23764," Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?",joey
23765," Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.",ross
23766, Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.,joey
23767,  Also an island.,ross
23768," Hey, what time is it?",joey
23769,  2:17.,ross
23770," Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?",joey
23771, Are you serious?!,ross
23772, Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.,joey
23773, Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!,ross
23774," Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!",joey
23775,"  Hey, you guys…",rachel
23776, Hey!,joey
23777, Is Monica here?,rachel
23778," All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.",rachel
23779, You bought Shawn Cassidy!,ross
23780," Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?",rachel
23781, Okay!  Check it out!,rachel
23782, What-what is it?!,ross
23783, What the hell is that?!!,joey
23784," It's a, it's a cat!",rachel
23785," That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}",joey
23786, Yes it is!,rachel
23787, Why is it inside out?!,ross
23788," Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!",rachel
23789, How much did you pay for that?,ross
23790," Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.",rachel
23791, Yeah? How much?,ross
23792, A thousand bucks.,rachel
23793, ON A CAT??!!!!,ross
23794, It's not a cat!,joey
23795," All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!",rachel
23796," Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}",ross
23797, It's not a cat!,joey
23798," Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.  Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!",rachel
23799,"  Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?",ross
23800," Uhh, the ball thing.",joey
23801, Yeah?,ross
23802," Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!",joey
23803," Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!",ross
23804, Okay!,joey
23805,  Uh-oh.,joey
23806, What?,ross
23807, I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!,joey
23808," Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!",joey
23809," I know!  Don't switch hands, okay?",ross
23810, Hey ladies! What are you in here for? ,chandler
23811," Gary, I'm here to report a crime.",chandler
23812, It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.,chandler
23813," Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.",chandler
23814," Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!",chandler
23815, You mean scared.,chandler
23816, Scared? Happy?,chandler
23817," I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!",chandler

23851," You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, ""Rachel!""",rachel
23852, Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.,ross

23893, I tried! They won't take her back.,rachel

23895," Rach, why won't they take it back?",monica

23905, So you're moving in with him. What happened?,monica
23906," I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.",phoebe
23907," Why, do you write him a lot?",monica
23908," No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?",phoebe
23909," Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.",phoebe
23910," No, nothing.",phoebe
23911, Yeah.,phoebe

24812, Where is the waitress?! I’m starving!,joey
24813, It’s a buffet man.,chandler
24814," Oh, here’s where I win all my money back! ",joey
24815," Listen, I gotta talk to you.",chandler
24816, Sure! What’s up? ,joey
24817, Monica and I almost got married last night.,chandler
24818," Oh my God! That’s huge!  Wait a minute, why come I wasn’t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don’t say, ""Ross."" Do not say, ""Ross.""",joey
24819," Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?",chandler
24820, Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material.,joey
24821, What?!,chandler
24822," Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she’s anything like me, she’s just gonna be relieved.",joey
24823," How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s gonna break his heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore.",monica
24824, Well you don’t.,phoebe
24825, Yes I do!,monica
24826, Good! Good! I was just testing you.,phoebe
24827,  Hi.,chandler
24828," Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.",monica
24829," No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.",phoebe
24830, Hey!,ross
24831, Hey!,chandler
24832, What?,ross
24833, Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…,chandler

24841," No, we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous!",rachel
24842, We-we-we—I remember being in a chapel.,ross
24843, Oh my God.,rachel
24844, I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!,ross
24845, No!,rachel
24846, They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!,joey
24847," Hell, I’m drunk right now!  What? I can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation!",phoebe
24848, What are you guys gonna do?,monica
24849," Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? ",rachel
24850," Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free.",chandler
24851," Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get divorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment.",ross
24852, An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here.,joey
24853," Oh-oh, that’s your thing.",phoebe
24854, What?,ross
24855, You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy who gets divorced.,phoebe
24856," No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!",ross
24857," Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy.  I’m so drunk.",phoebe
24858," So, what do you think we should do?",monica
24859, I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!,chandler
24860, I know I love you! ,monica
24861, So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.,chandler
24862," That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!",monica
24863," Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight  then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.",chandler
24864," All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don’t get married.",monica
24865, Sounds great.,chandler

24870,"  Yes, yes eight.",chandler
24871, Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight.,monica
24872," That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess.",chandler
24873, Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.,monica
24874," That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!",chandler
24875, I wanted it so bad!  Wanna go pack?,monica
24876," Yeah.  We’re doing the right thing, right?",chandler
24877," Ohh, of course we are!  We left it up to fate.  If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign. ",monica
24878," Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  Come on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any  QUESTIONS!!!",phoebe
24879,  What?!,joey
24880," Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!",phoebe
24881, All right. All right.,joey

24893," Yes, exactly!",ross
24894, And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!,rachel
24895," Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk you into this more.",ross
24896," Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding.",rachel
24897," I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have three failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!",ross
24898, What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!,rachel
24899," Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!",ross
24900," Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me.",rachel
24901, I’m asking you to do me a favor.,ross
24902, You are asking me to be your wife!,rachel
24903, And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.,ross
24904, That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.,monica
24905, Well you did pull his hair.,chandler

24914, Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!,joey
24915," Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!",phoebe
24916, Do you like car games?,phoebe
24917, I love the license plate game!,phoebe

24923,"  No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.",rachel
24924, I don’t know if it’s true.,ross
24925, Oh b-b-but it is!,rachel
24926," Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...",ross

24930," Oh, okay.",phoebe

24932," Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh?  Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!",joey

24934," Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn’t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.",joey

24952, Then all your stuff would be here.,monica
24953," Well, what if all my stuff was here?",chandler

25034," Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?",monica
25035," No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, ""Joey, I have too…"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""…go to the bathroom."" He may think I’m sick.",chandler

25069," Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!",phoebe
25070," Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!",ross
25071," Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three times, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates…",phoebe
25072,"  No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.",ross
25073," Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!",phoebe
25074, Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?,ross
25075," Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here.",phoebe
25076, What?! Why?,ross
25077,"  Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn’t you date him?",phoebe

25089," Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap.  Seriously.",chandler
25090," I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!",rachel
25091," Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…",chandler
25092, What?,rachel
25093,  All yours babe. ,chandler

25102, Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God…  Come and knock on my door…,rachel
25103,  We’ll be waiting for you…,monica
25104," …once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.",ross
25105," Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him?",phoebe
25106," Okay, what about you?  Wouldn’t you want a date?",phoebe
25107,  Whatever! What about you Meg?,phoebe
25108, What?!,ross
25109,"  She said, ""He’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."" ",phoebe
25110," This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?",ross
25111," Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.",phoebe
25112," We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!",ross
25113, Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!,phoebe
25114,"  Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times.",ross
25115," Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, ""Well done!"" Bravo Meg.",phoebe
25116,"  Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth——Nothing!!",ross
25117," Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?",chandler

25119," Well, Joey’s my best friend.",chandler
25120, I’m not your best friend?,monica
25121, You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?,chandler

25132," No! But, I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.",monica
25133, Um-hmm.,rachel
25134," Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.",monica
25135,"  Oh my God! Oh, that’s funny, I can’t believe I did that.",rachel
25136," Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn’t clear! I’m really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’s absolutely no rush.",monica
25137, Okay. ,rachel
25138, Okay. Don’t you want a cookie?,monica
25139, Sure?  Thanks.,rachel
25140," Maybe, do you need a tissue?",monica
25141," Monica, where did you get these?!",rachel
25142, I made them!,monica
25143," Ooh, good God, they’re so yummy! ",rachel
25144," God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here. Y’know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. ""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?"" ""Can’t, its not there.""",joey
25145," Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",chandler
25146, Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.,joey
25147, Not once did we do that.,chandler
25148,  Hi.,monica
25149, Hey!,chandler
25150, Hi.,joey
25151," So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.",monica
25152," Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?",chandler
25153," Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad. ",monica
25154, And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?,chandler
25155," I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don’t I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!",monica
25156, Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie’s!!,joey
25157," Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!",chandler
25158, Yes.,ross
25159," Yes, second in two years. Third overall.",ross
25160," Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…",ross
25161," Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.",ross
25162, This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.,ross
25163, I think just the annulment for today.,ross
25164, Easy.,ross
25165, No problem.,ross
25166," Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.",ross
25167," Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel?  I will think about the therapy.",ross
25168, Hey!,rachel
25169," Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.",monica
25170, Okay!,rachel
25171," Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.",monica
25172, Okay.,rachel
25173," Hey Rach, what about this?  Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don’t know if I want it because it might be y’know, too many memories!",monica
25174,  What the hell is that?,rachel
25175," I don’t know.  Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.",monica
25176," Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!",rachel
25177, Something to remember me by!,monica
25178," Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know, I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time.",rachel
25179," But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!",monica
25180, Are you okay? You’re not blinking.,rachel
25181," I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of era.",monica
25182," Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era.",rachel
25183," An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!",monica
25184, What is the matter with you?!,rachel
25185, What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?! Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren’t you gonna miss me at all?!,monica
25186," All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe.",rachel
25187, What’s hard to believe?,monica
25188," Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry.",rachel
25189," Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.",monica
25190, But I…,rachel
25191," No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.",monica
25192, It is? Really?,rachel
25193," Yeah, sweetie.",monica
25194,"  I mean we’re not, we’re not gonna live together anymore?",rachel
25195, No.,monica
25196, What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much! ,rachel
25197, I’m gonna miss you! ,monica
25198, I mean it’s the end of an era!,rachel
25199, I know!,monica
25200,"  Okay, bye!",phoebe
25201, Oh no.,ross
25202, So? Did you get the annulment?,phoebe
25203, I couldn’t.,ross
25204, I knew it! Because you love Rachel.,phoebe
25205, It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…,ross
25206," Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love.",phoebe
25207," I… I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?",ross
25208, I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.,phoebe
25209, I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! ,ross
25210," Ohh, what’s wrong?!",ross
25211, Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.,rachel
25212, Oh my—Come here! Come here!  It’s okay. Everything’s gonna be okay.,ross
25213, Thank you.,rachel
25214, Of course.,ross
25215," So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?",joey
25216," Oh we do, but not just yet.",phoebe
25217," Really?! Well, when?",joey
25218," Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out.",phoebe
25219, Wow.,joey
25220," I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.",phoebe
25221, Great!,joey
25222, But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem.,phoebe
25223," Oh-oh, what about Ross?",joey
25224," I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.",phoebe
25225,  Hey!,chandler
25226, Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!,phoebe
25227,  Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!,joey
25228,"  Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.",rachel
25229," Uh-huh, what?",phoebe
25230, Well since I’m movin’ out and-and you’re so beautiful…,rachel
25231, Oh!,phoebe
25232, …how about I move in with you?,rachel
25233," Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?",phoebe
25234, Who’s Denise?,monica
25235, My roommate.,phoebe
25236, You have a roommate?!,rachel
25237," Yes, Denise. Denise!",phoebe
25238," Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?",joey
25239," Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?",chandler
25240, Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!,phoebe
25241," Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra room over at my place…",joey
25242," Oh, that’s true.",rachel
25243," Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?",joey
25244," Yeah, yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place.",rachel
25245, Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!,chandler
25246, Hey.,phoebe
25247, Hey!,ross
25248," So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?",phoebe
25249," Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.",ross
25250, You didn’t tell her did you?,phoebe
25251, No.,ross
25252," Of course not, because you’re in love with her.",phoebe
25253," I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.",ross
25254," What do you mean, comforted her?",phoebe
25255," It’s nothing, I just gave her a hug.",ross
25256," Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!",phoebe
25257, It’s also a sign of friendship.,ross
25258," Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. ",phoebe
25259,  It was a hug!,ross
25260," Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?",phoebe
25261, S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?,ross
25262," Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them!  Oh come on Ross, you’re a scientist.",phoebe
25263," I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty.  What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!",ross
25264,"  Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are.",phoebe
25265,"  If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!",ross
25266," Okay, I didn’t understand that, but y’know, maybe that’s ‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love!",phoebe
25267," Hey!  Dude, some guy just called for you.",joey
25268, Who was it?,chandler
25269," I don’t know! How about, ""Thanks for taking the message."" Jeez! ",joey
25270," Okay listen, y’know when you move in Rachel’s room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?",monica
25271, Sure!,chandler
25272," Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.",monica
25273," Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!",chandler
25274, No.,monica
25275," Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely.""",chandler
25276," Oh, I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.",monica
25277," So, that’s it?",chandler
25278, I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,monica
25279, Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!,chandler
25280, What do you have against the beautiful guest room?,monica
25281," I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!",chandler
25282, Are you mocking me?,monica
25283," No, I’m not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room. ",chandler
25284," Hey, what’s up?",joey
25285," Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.",chandler
25286," But you’re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today. ",joey
25287,"  ""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" Nice!",chandler
25288," Yeah? I just figured y’know, after living with you it’d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who’s different than me. And what’s more different than me; a guy who’s not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh?  Not just a hat rack my friend!",joey
25289," Pheebs, I have to ask you…",rachel
25290, Shhhhhh! I’m swamped right now.,phoebe
25291, You’re just staring into space.,rachel
25292," Umm, I’m trying to move that pencil. ",phoebe
25293, This one? ,rachel
25294, It worked!,phoebe
25295," Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this;  ""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" It’s just, there is nothing! The city’s full!",rachel
25296," Wait, no, look at this!   ""Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay…"" Oh, yeah, but it’s on the ground floor.",phoebe
25297,  Hey!,ross
25298, Hey.,rachel
25299," Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?",ross
25300, Yeah! Why?,rachel
25301," Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?",ross
25302, That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love Warren! Thank you!,rachel
25303," Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.  Here’s Warren’s number.",ross
25304," Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thank you!",rachel
25305," Okay, you go grab it!",ross
25306, I saw it.,phoebe
25307, I don’t know what you’re talking about.,ross
25308," Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t admit. You love her again; you re-love her!",phoebe
25309," Look, I do not re-love her.",ross
25310," I can’t believe you won’t just admit it!  Okay, just promise me that you won’t do anything stupid.",phoebe
25311," Look, we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?",ross
25312,"  Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything.",rachel
25313, You can live with me.,ross
25314, What?!,rachel
25315, What?!,phoebe
25316, What?,ross
25317, Oh my God! Are you serious?!,rachel
25318, Uh-huh. ,ross
25319, I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank you!,rachel
25320," Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out.",ross
25321," Wow! I’m-I’m so happy for you guys.  This is so-so, not stupid.",phoebe
25322," Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!",rachel
25323," Hero, I uh, I don’t know—well, all right.",ross
25324," Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! ",rachel
25325," Oh please!   You’re gonna say things now, aren’t ya?",ross
25326," No. No, I won’t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that’s how she ended up living with me!   Okay, that’s a lie.",phoebe
25327, Hi.,chandler
25328, Hi.,monica
25329," Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get girls, and now I can ‘em—Now, I have you.  Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women…",chandler
25330, Stop it Chandler.  I’m sorry too.,monica
25331, Really?,chandler
25332, Yeah! Oh yes!,monica
25333, Ohh.,chandler
25334," Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.",monica
25335, That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.,chandler
25336, Totally!,monica
25337, We don’t have to come up with this now.,chandler
25338, Oh good.,monica
25339," Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?",chandler
25340, Changes?,monica
25341," Yeah, I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. ",chandler
25342, You’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?,monica
25343, Is that a problem?,chandler
25344," Well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together.",monica
25345," Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.",chandler
25346, See now-now you’re taking them away from their home.,monica
25347," Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!",chandler
25348," Yeah-yeah, y’know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’t match! Where is it gonna go?!",monica
25349, In the game room!,chandler
25350, Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!,monica
25351, All right! That’s fine! That’s fine! I won’t bring over the chairs! I won’t bring anything over! I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma’s place!! ,chandler
25352,"  Everything on your application looks really good—Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",joey
25353," Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?",joey
25354,  You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! I’ll be living here. ,chandler
25355," Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it.",joey
25356, Why did you take the shower curtain down?,chandler
25357, That thing was a hazard!  I’m very safety conscious.,joey
25358, Hey!,rachel
25359," Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.",ross
25360," Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.",rachel
25361," What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right?",ross
25362," No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.",rachel
25363, What?! Over a stupid room!,ross
25364," Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here!",rachel
25365," Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!",ross
25366," What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!",ross
25367," Ross, we can handle this.",monica
25368," Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!",ross
25369," Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly! ",chandler
25370,"  Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",ross
25371," Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",chandler
25372, Love is the best medicine.,monica
25373, That’s laughter.,chandler
25374, Why do you do it?,monica
25375, I don’t know.,chandler
25376," Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?",ross
25377," Yeah, I do.",chandler
25378," And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?",ross
25379, Yes.,monica
25380,  Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! ,ross
25381," No-no, I’m staying put.",rachel
25382," Why, where are you going?",rachel
25383,  Hey Rach!,ross
25384, Hi!,rachel
25385," You’re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That’s great news right—I mean for them. Right?",ross
25386, Oh wow.,rachel
25387," Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.",ross
25388," Yeah. Y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’s gonna be weird?",rachel
25389," Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?",ross
25390," Well, because of us! Because of our history.",rachel
25391, No!,ross
25392, No?,rachel
25393," No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?",ross
25394, No! Not at all!,rachel
25395, Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends who happen to be roommates.,ross
25396," Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.",rachel
25397, Really?! We are?,ross
25398," Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend, you’re gonna have a girlfriend…",rachel
25399, Ohh! That would be great.,ross
25400," But y’know what, if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll just work out a system. Y’know, it’ll be like college, I’ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, ""Come back later, I’m gettin’ lucky."" ",rachel
25401,"  Yeah, I didn’t think of that.",ross
25402, So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?!,ross
25403, That’s very funny!,monica
25404," He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!",chandler
25405," No, I-I-I’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!",ross
25406," Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.",monica
25407," Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn’t about the room, this is about what the room…represents! And unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!!",ross
25408," Yeah that’s not worried. {Transcriber’s note: I think that’s what he says, if anyone thinks any different let me know. ‘Cause that sentence doesn’t make sense to me, but I played it 20 times and that’s what I came up with.}",chandler
25409," Yeah, no, me neither.",monica
25410," Fine! It’s your life!  I just don’t want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together,  but that’s what you want, there’s nothing I can do.  DON’T DO IT!!!!! ",ross

25425, Really?!,chandler
25426," Uh, no!!",monica

25441," Ehh, I don’t, I don’t think so. She’s already talked about y’know, dating other guys.",ross
25442," That’s not gonna work out! Then she’s gonna come home all weepy and you’ll be tellin’ her, ""Oh that’s okay. You’ll find someone."" And then, bamn! She finds you!",joey
25443," Yeah, well, m-maybe you’re right.",ross

25452," Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.",rachel
25453," Thursday’s clearly not good for ya, pick a day!",joey
25454,  Hi!,joey
25455," Come in. Thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!",joey

25468,"  You complete me kitchen, matey!",ross
25469," Ross, I know what you’re thinking.",phoebe
25470, What?,ross
25471," That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad.",phoebe
25472, Oh…my…God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!,ross
25473, What?!!,phoebe
25474," Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her. It’s always, ""Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?"" ""Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?"" ""When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?"" You want her!",ross

25485," Well, who wouldn’t?!",rachel
25486," I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? ""Professor Geller.""",ross

25501, What?!,chandler
25502," Yeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.",phoebe
25503, Phoebe that’s crazy!,monica
25504, I can’t believe she would say that too you.,joey
25505, Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?,rachel
25506, I don’t—she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.,phoebe
25507, Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?,chandler
25508," No, ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve only got a week left, y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now! (So she picks up the latest copy of Car and Driver , leans back, and starts reading.)",phoebe
25509,  Hey everyone!,ross
25510, Oh hi!,chandler
25511," Hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?",ross
25512,"  ""There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…""",ross
25513," Oh, this is it. This what’s gonna kill me.",phoebe
25514,"  ""…subcategories. The first of these subcategories is…""",ross
25515,"  Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?",joey

25518," Ohh! Okay! Okay.  ""There are three  primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.   Each of these theories  can be further subcategorized  into…""",ross
25519, Why don’t you open with a joke?,chandler
25520," Open with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club!",ross
25521," Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!",chandler
25522,  Okay!,ross
25523," Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?",rachel
25524, Thank you!,ross
25525," Some uh, some visual aides.",rachel

25527, Please don’t say naked chicks.,ross
25528, Why not?!,joey
25529, I-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.,ross
25530, That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19.,chandler
25531, Hey.,chandler

25535,"  ""Benefits lapsed.""",chandler
25536, Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.,joey

25538, Let me see that!,joey
25539, All right.,chandler
25540,"  Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I gotta be careful?!",joey
25541," I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire.",chandler
25542," All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent.",joey
25543," Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.",chandler
25544,  …look both ways before you cross the street. ,joey
25545, Hey!,phoebe
25546," Hey Pheebs, you’re still alive! How are you doing?",rachel

25548," Pheebs, what-what are you doing?",rachel
25549, I was preparing you for my—didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off?,phoebe
25550," Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?",rachel
25551," Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.",phoebe
25552, Monica!,rachel

25564," Wow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before.",rachel
25565," I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all, ""Ross you have to be funny and sexy."" Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.",ross
25566, That you’re not funny or sexy?,monica
25567, That’s right!,ross
25568,"  Hey Estelle, listen…",joey
25569, What are you talkin’ about? I never left you! You’ve always been my agent!,joey

25574, Hey!,chandler
25575,  Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time.,joey
25576," That’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?",chandler
25577, What?!,joey
25578, What’s wrong with you?,chandler
25579," Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.",joey
25580, This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!,chandler
25581," No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! ",joey
25582, That’s a hernia.,chandler
25583, Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!,joey
25584," Well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15 minutes.",rachel
25585," Yeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch.",monica
25586," Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa.  Hey sisters!   Wow, we really are bitches.",rachel
25587,"  Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when— Oh bloody hell.",ross
25588, What the hell are you doing?!,monica
25589," Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.",ross
25590," Yeah, and not a very good one.",rachel
25591, Will you-will you please?,ross

25598,"  Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.",rachel
25599," Hey, will you grab me a cruller?  Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!",chandler
25600," Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing.",joey
25601, I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.,chandler
25602," Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.",joey
25603, Hey!,phoebe
25604, Hey.,chandler
25605, Hey!,joey
25606, What’s going on?,phoebe
25607," Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!",chandler
25608," Look, I’m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here  it doesn’t hurt that bad.",joey
25609, Hey! Maybe you’ll die!,phoebe
25610," Sure, now I’m scared.",joey
25611," No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday.",phoebe
25612," Yeah, but I don’t wanna die!",joey
25613," No-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!",phoebe
25614, Gimme ‘em!,monica
25615, No! They are mine!,rachel
25616, You stole them from me!,monica
25617, You stole them from me!!,rachel
25618, Gimme them!,monica
25619, You just wanna each take one?,monica
25620, Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.,rachel
25621,"  Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?",ross
25622, Well…,rachel
25623," Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.",monica
25624," Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!",rachel
25625, They’re not listening too me?,ross
25626, Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.,rachel
25627, Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?,ross

25661," Uh no, he’s not. Can I take a message?",rachel
25662, Ross got married again—Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!,rachel
25663,"  All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory  the team would never have identified  the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . Were there any questions at this point?  Yes. ",ross
25664,"  Come again? What’s-what’s this nonsense?   All right, I’m-I’m not English. I’m from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I’m sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions?  About paleontology.  All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression…",ross

25681," Okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face another failed marriage.",ross
25682," Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?",chandler

25710," What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don’t have a roommate.",phoebe
25711," Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.",rachel
25712, Maybe you could be my roommate!,phoebe
25713, Well there’s an idea!!,rachel
25714, Yeah!,phoebe
25715," That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?",rachel
25716," Umm, she said she’d be back December 26th.",phoebe
25717," December 26th, huh maybe she’s Santa Clause.",rachel
25718,"  Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.",rachel
25719," Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I’ll take care of everything.",ross
25720," Well sure, if you say you’re gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms!  All right, now I’m gonna do this my way and I don’t want to hear a peep out of you!",rachel
25721," Okay Rach, but…",ross
25722, Op! You’re peeping!,rachel
25723," Ross! Y’know what, I just got—why? Why did you do this?!",rachel
25724, Look I told you…,ross
25725," I don’t wanna hear ""Three failed marriages!""",rachel
25726," Look, if you’d had two failed marriages, you’d understand!",ross
25727," Well, y’know what? Thanks to you I’m half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don’t think I have ever been this angry!",rachel
25728, What about the time I said we were on a break?,ross
25729, Ugh! ,rachel
25730," Pheebs, how’s it going?",monica
25731,  I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you think they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast?,phoebe
25732," Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.",monica
25733," Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben.  Do you know what Pheebs? When you’re done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. ",chandler
25734," Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",phoebe
25735, See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.,chandler
25736, What do you mean?,monica
25737," I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around… ",chandler
25738," That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.",phoebe
25739," Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.",chandler
25740, This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.,monica
25741, Yeah?  Well this is not what I ordered.,phoebe
25742,  Hey guys!,joey
25743, Hey!,chandler
25744, Hey!,phoebe
25745," Hey babies! Oh, I’m having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I’ve got the keys too, still there!",joey
25746, Shocking! Since you still have the keys.,chandler
25747," You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.",joey
25748, What equity investments?,chandler
25749," The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up!  But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they’re gonna start to think that I don’t own it. So I figured I’ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?",joey
25750," Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.",monica
25751, You don’t even have a car!,chandler
25752," I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.",monica
25753, And?,chandler
25754, And six others.,monica
25755, There you are.,chandler
25756," Yeah, she tops out at 130.",joey
25757, And that’s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.,joey
25758, Sure!,joey
25759," Okay, take it easy.",joey
25760," Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.",joey
25761," Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I’m just polishing her up.",joey
25762," Yeah, but it’s my wax.",joey
25763," Sure. Here.  I’ll uh, save your parking spot.",joey
25764, Why not?,joey
25765," Yeah, so did I.",joey
25766, I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.,phoebe
25767," Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that’s the same.",monica
25768,"  Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog! ",chandler
25769," Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone’s eye out!",monica
25770, He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!,chandler
25771," No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up.",phoebe
25772," They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!",chandler
25773, What?!,phoebe
25774," Glass, sand, whatever. ",chandler
25775," Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.",phoebe
25776, Oh it’s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.,monica
25777," Oh, I can still do that.",phoebe
25778, How are you still single?!,monica
25779,  All right.  I thought about it and maybe you’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.,chandler
25780, Good. What made you change your mind?,monica
25781, I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.,chandler
25782, How did that happen?!!,phoebe
25783," Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat.  ",chandler
25784," Damnit! Y’know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! ",monica
25785," Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",rachel
25786," Fine, I’m mentally unstable.",ross
25787, What?!,ross
25788," Uh yes, heroin and crack.",rachel
25789, Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!,ross
25790," Well, you would know.",rachel
25791," Oh, come on!",ross
25792,"  Ross, please, I found the magazines!",rachel
25793," Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin, I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now!",ross
25794, And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!,ross
25795, Ugh!,rachel
25796," Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!  And could you strike ""Consummated like bunnies"" from the record?",rachel
25797," Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.",rachel
25798,"  That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!",ross
25799,  What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!,rachel
25800, And what——What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don’t get the annulment. Don’t type that! What?! Stop typing!  Hey! Stop typing!  Stop typing! Stop typing!!,ross
25801,"  Okay, do you see, do you see what you’re keeping me married too?!",rachel
25802," All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!",rachel
25803, Yeah!,ross
25804, And thank you for your time. ,rachel
25805,  So the Porsche guy took his car back.,joey
25806, But you found the keys to his clothes?,chandler
25807," No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.",joey
25808, And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing the clothes?,monica
25809, Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right?,joey
25810, That is true.,chandler
25811," Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.",phoebe
25812," Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. ",joey
25813," Joey, you know you don’t actually have one.",monica
25814, Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her! ,joey
25815," Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.",chandler
25816," All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room.",monica
25817," What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting!",phoebe
25818," The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for a while!",monica
25819, But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!,phoebe
25820," He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got to go to the hospital.",monica
25821," But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.",phoebe
25822, I think that’s gum.,chandler
25823, I’m pretty sure it’s gun.,phoebe
25824," Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go.",chandler
25825," A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do? ",phoebe
25826, Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche?,joey
25827,  Porsche.,joey
25828, This is totally your fault!,rachel
25829, My fault?! You threatened the judge!,ross
25830," Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!",rachel
25831, That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!,ross
25832, Hi! How are the Gellers?,joey
25833, Don’t call us that! ,rachel
25834, The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? ,ross
25835, Hey! It’s Porsche!! ,joey
25836," Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I’m gonna take that spit bubble as, ""Yeah, I do!"" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I’ll set you up with a clean one.  Okay, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? ‘Cause let’s face it, we’re at Monica’s.  I broke it. All right. Well, that’s just the way that goes.  Okay, good.  Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can’t answer.  Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words!  Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh!  Oh, you’re a lot mischievous! Well, it’ll dry.   Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now—who aren’t there! ",phoebe
25837,  Hey!,chandler
25838,  How do you feel?,phoebe
25839," Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.",chandler
25840," Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed ‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed.",phoebe
25841, And protected them from a tornado?,chandler
25842, Oh my God.,monica
25843," I know, the babies are asleep.",phoebe
25844," Phoebe, what, what happened here?!",monica
25845, I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!,phoebe
25846, But my apartment!,monica
25847, Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph.,chandler
25848, But the mess!,monica
25849, Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.,chandler
25850," You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out. ‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!",monica
25851,"  Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!",chandler
25852,"  Oh honey thank God you’re home, I was getting worried.",rachel
25853," I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I’ve already signed everything and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign.",ross
25854," Oh, little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything!",rachel
25855," Y’know, I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?",ross
25856," Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!",rachel
25857," Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!",ross
25858, Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!,rachel
25859, Yeah! Right!,ross
25860," You’re right. That’s very different. So let’s, let’s just sign the papers. All right?  What?",ross
25861, Nothing. ,rachel
25862," Okay, can we just sign please?",ross
25863, Uh-hmm. ,rachel
25864, Congratulations. ,ross
25865," Okay Ross, we’re—wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.",rachel
25866, What?,ross
25867," Well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.",rachel
25868, Excuse me?,ross
25869," Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?",rachel
25870, Yeah?,ross
25871," And uh, yeah, I didn’t really, I didn’t want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then  to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.",rachel
25872," So then if-if—I mean if you think about it, this is all  your fault.",ross
25873," Yeah, don’t push it though.",rachel
25874," I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.",ross
25875," I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret, and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. ",rachel
25876," Did I, did I even treat?",ross
25877," No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.",rachel
25878, That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.,ross
25879," Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.",rachel
25880," Eh, no problem.",ross
25881, I’m gonna need a copy of those.,rachel
25882, Totally. ,ross
25883, Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!,joey
25884, Hey! How you doin’?,joey
25885," I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping.  Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? ",joey
25886,"  Okay!  Listen, I’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.",chandler
25887, Right! And when is that due?,joey
25888, First of the month.,chandler
25889, And that’s every month?,joey
25890," No, just the months you actually want to live here.",chandler
25891, Ahhh.,joey
25892," Okay, here is the phone bill. ",chandler
25893,  Oh my God!!,joey
25894," That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover you for a while?",chandler
25895, No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.,joey
25896," It’s not charity, Joe…",chandler
25897," No! Forget it! Okay—I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on.",joey
25898," Okay uh, here’s the electric bill. ",chandler
25899, This is how much we pay for electric?!!!,joey
25900," Uh, yeah.",chandler
25901," So, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?",chandler
25902, So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?,phoebe
25903," No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it.",chandler
25904," Well, how much do you think he needs?",phoebe
25905," I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.",chandler
25906, Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.,phoebe
25907, Well that would help the pride thing.,chandler
25908,  Hey!,monica
25909, Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?,chandler
25910,  Okay.,monica
25911," Okay!  So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?",chandler
25912," Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.",monica
25913," And also, my birthday.",phoebe
25914, It’s not your birthday.,monica
25915, What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!,phoebe
25916, Hey!,joey

25920," Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing.",chandler
25921," Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.",ross
25922," I don’t know Ross, not if you’re gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.",joey
25923, I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!,ross
25924,"  Pheebs, I was wondering…",rachel
25925, You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!,monica
25926, Well and clearly not a minute sooner.,rachel
25927," Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you’re packed.",monica
25928, Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.,rachel
25929," My God, I can’t get a minute of peace around this place.",phoebe
25930, Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you.,phoebe
25931," Yeah, yeah, I know.",rachel
25932," Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that.",phoebe
25933,"  Rachel, I need to borrow—You’re not packed!!!! You’re not packed even a little bit!",monica
25934, Surprise!!,rachel
25935, What?,monica
25936," No, no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, ""What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!"" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!",rachel
25937,"  I’ll be coordinator! Oh my God! I’m so sorry, I didn’t get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can’t you Phoebe?",monica
25938, I have plans.,phoebe
25939, You’re plans were with us.,monica
25940, That’s right.,phoebe

25942, Okay.,phoebe
25943," Okay!  Oh my God, thank you!!",monica
25944," Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves! ",phoebe

25948," Yes, but for the last time.",chandler
25949," Okay fine, now Ross…",monica
25950," Oh, but-but I can’t do it.",ross

25952,  I’ve got Ben.,joey
25953," Because, because I’ve got Ben.",ross
25954," It’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?",monica
25955, He’s at a dinner party.,chandler
25956, Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!,monica
25957," Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?",ross
25958," All right, sorry. ",monica
25959,  I gotta go make a fake Ben.,ross
25960, Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.,joey
25961," Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.",chandler
25962," Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!",joey
25963," Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?",chandler
25964," What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.",joey
25965, Yes it would. What do you say to $50?,chandler
25966," Okay, you’re on.",joey
25967," Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.",chandler
25968," Ohhhhhh, look it’s the roller blades.",rachel
25969,  Oh God!,monica

25973," You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time…  You don’t remember?",phoebe
25974," I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.",rachel
25975, I’m gonna miss you so much.,monica
25976," Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you’re not gonna miss.",phoebe
25977, I don’t think there’s anything.,monica
25978," Come on, there’s gotta be something.",phoebe
25979," Nope, she’s perfect.",monica
25980, I have one.,rachel
25981, Good! Great! You can go first.,phoebe
25982," Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen. ",rachel
25983," Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y’know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?",phoebe
25984," Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.",monica
25985," Okay, good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better?",phoebe
25986, Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.,monica
25987, You get your messages!,rachel
25988," Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.",monica
25989," So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?",rachel
25990, Great! It worked! No one’s sad.,phoebe

25997," Okay, here we go. Ready?",joey
25998, No! No! No! No——one can beat me.,chandler
25999," See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.",chandler
26000," Hello?  Oh, hi Ross!  See? Other people call me!",monica
26001," Ooh, your brother. Score!",rachel
26002,  What’s up?,monica

26065," Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.",chandler
26066, Really?,joey
26067," Hey, I didn’t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.  Don’t get to excited because that’s not gonna happen unless you get—No way! ",chandler
26068," Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, ""What were you thinking?""",monica

26084," When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.",monica
26085," Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.",rachel
26086," And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.   You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! ",monica
26087," Oh, it’s gonna be fine.",rachel

26096, Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!,chandler
26097," The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn’t even get half a cup! Nothin’!!",joey
26098, Oh man!!,chandler
26099," And he never played before either! Y’know what I think? I think beginner’s luck, very important in Cups.",joey

26105," Wait a second, I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’re trying to give me money again!",joey
26106, When did I try to give you money?,chandler
26107," Over there!  Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said ""No,"" you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!",joey
26108, I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you’re okay.,chandler
26109," I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can’t take care of myself. Okay? Look, I’m not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I’m gonna miss…is you. And now the dog.",joey

26134," I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.",ross
26135, At a fake game!!,chandler
26136," Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I’d be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.",ross

26178,  And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.,chandler
26179, Hey!,monica
26180,"  Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!",monica

26260," She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.",chandler

26262," I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.",chandler
26263," Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.",ross

26265,  Hi!,monica
26266," Hey Mon, how's it going?",chandler

26268," Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.",chandler
26269, It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.,monica
26270, No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.,chandler
26271,"  Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?",monica

26273," Yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there.",ross
26274," We should start with the big stuff. Y’know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch.  I got it. ",chandler
26275," Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.",ross
26276," What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.",chandler
26277," Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.",ross
26278," OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.",chandler
26279," Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.",ross
26280," Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!",chandler
26281,"  Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame!  What the hell's going on over here?!?!?  Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.",joey
26282," Hey, I've been married 3 times",ross
26283," No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?",joey
26284," Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.",ross
26285," Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?",chandler
26286," Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go ""ba dum bum chessh""",ross
26287," Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.",chandler
26288," Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.",ross
26289, That's not specific to girls.,chandler
26290," This is great, this is great, what else, what else?",joey
26291," Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.",ross
26292, And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.,chandler
26293, They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.,ross
26294," Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.",chandler
26295,  I'm never gonna find love again.,ross
26296," Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?",rachel
26297, Sure,phoebe

26300," Well, I-I should've told you the truth.",rachel
26301," Uh-Huh, Which is...?",phoebe
26302," Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...",rachel
26303, So?,phoebe
26304," Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.",rachel
26305, Why do you care?,phoebe
26306, Because they're people.,rachel
26307, But people that you don't know and will never see again.,phoebe
26308," Yes, but still. They're people…with eyes.",rachel

The neighbor's dog.",phoebe

26351," Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.",monica
26352," Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",chandler
26353," It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?",monica
26354, Do you want me to be afraid of you?,chandler

26359," All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?",monica
26360," So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...",ross

26406, That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either.,chandler
26407, I don’t think mine likes me either.,monica
26408, Maybe it’s a universal thing?,ross
26409," Or maybe, it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday. ",joey

26427, Like this.  Pictures of cute babies we don’t know. We..we can’t have that.,joey

26474, What?,phoebe

26477, To get you to make out with him!!!,rachel
26478, Ohhh.,phoebe

26494," Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.",monica

26496," You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right, I’m sorry.",monica
26497," Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.",chandler

26501, Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders.,joey

26507, No.,rachel
26508," Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.",rachel
26509, I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard. ,rachel
26510, Mmm-Hmm.,ross
26511, Mmm.,ross
26512, Mm-Hmm.,ross
26513,  Hmm-Hmm.,ross
26514, Mmm-Unmm.,ross
26515," Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.  Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm.",ross
26516," So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.",joey
26517," Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.",monica
26518," Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.",chandler
26519," Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.",monica
26520," Ohh, I love birds. ",joey
26521, What is the matter with you ?!?,chandler
26522, What?,joey
26523," You’re arranging flowers!  You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!",chandler
26524," Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.",joey
26525, You’re turning into a women.,chandler
26526, No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.,joey
26527, Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?,chandler
26528," It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it….Oh My God, I’m a women!!!",joey
26529," Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.",rachel
26530, But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.,phoebe
26531, I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.,rachel
26532," Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?",phoebe
26533," You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?",rachel
26534, Just for a second.,phoebe
26535," Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?",rachel
26536," Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.",phoebe
26537," I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn’t.",rachel
26538," Ohh, sleep with Kenny.",phoebe
26539, That wouldn’t help me.,rachel
26540," Ohh, yes it would.",phoebe
26541, Mmm.,ross
26542,"  Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.  Me, neither. I’ve had a really good time too, you know. ",ross
26543,"  Ohh, I just like the smell.  Mmmm.",ross
26544, Hmm-Hmm.,ross
26545, Mmm-Hmm. ,ross
26546,  How about all the way.,ross
26547,"  Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster?  So, ahh, where were we?",ross
26548," Ohh, you can see them, huh?",ross
26549," I-I, did that for you.",ross
26550, What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999!,ross
26551," Kim, hi.",rachel
26552, Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.,rachel
26553,"  Yeah, he dumped me. He said, ""Rachel, I can’t do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry."" And then I don’t know why but he said, ""and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine.""",rachel
26554, Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.,rachel
26555, You and Ralph?,rachel
26556," Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.",joey
26557," I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That’s just the way it has to be.",joey
26558," Great…Great…and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn’t want to make a big deal out of this, you know.  You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.",joey
26559," And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.",joey
26560, And a couple of these little tiny boxes.,joey
26561,  Okay.,joey
26562,"  Okay, great!  Bye.  So guess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?",monica
26563, Sidney Poitier? Hehheh.,chandler
26564,"  I miss Rachel.  No, my parents.",monica
26565," Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!",chandler
26566," Yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.",monica
26567,  Why can’t I tell them that we live together?,chandler
26568, Because they don’t know we’re dating.  Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? ,monica
26569, Why haven’t you told them?!,chandler
26570," Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn’t.",monica
26571, Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!,chandler
26572,  So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I’ll see you then. ,monica
26573, Why wouldn’t they be happy?,chandler
26574," Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry.",monica
26575, What? What? Why?!,chandler
26576," Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.",monica
26577, Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?,chandler
26578," Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’t care what they think. I’m sorry.",monica
26579," Y’know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we’ll tell ‘em.",chandler
26580, You really think that’ll work?,monica
26581," Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?",chandler
26582,  I don’t think you’ll ever get my parents that drunk!,monica
26583," Hey!  Oh, good, Ross! You’re parents like me, right?",chandler
26584,"  Yes, of course they like you!",ross
26585, Well Monica just told me that they don’t.,chandler
26586,"  Yeah, they don’t like you.",ross
26587,  Do you know why?,chandler
26588," I dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh-",ross
26589,  Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!,chandler
26590," This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.",chandler
26591," Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?",joey
26592, Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.,chandler
26593, Well maybe I love ya’.,joey
26594, [mocks that last comment].,chandler

26599," Ye-ye, we go to yours!",joey
26600," Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s my sister. But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.",ross
26601," How you got three women to marry you, I’ll never know.",joey
26602, Hey!,phoebe
26603," Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English trifle!",rachel

26610," Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?",rachel

26627," You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you’re gonna eat here!",monica
26628," Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.",phoebe
26629," Oh, but-but it is, uh, it’s just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.",ross
26630," Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!",joey
26631," Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is it’s Chandler!",monica
26632," Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!",chandler

26635," Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.",phoebe
26636, Really?!,rachel
26637," Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. Y’know, I mean he used to be just, y’know “Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad” and now he’s he’s “Jack Geller, dream hunk.""",phoebe
26638," I dunno. Y’know to me he’ll always be “Jack Geller, walks in while you’re changing.”",rachel
26639," Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!",monica
26640," Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.",chandler
26641,  He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.,chandler
26642," Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!",joey
26643,"  Look at it, isn’t it beautiful?",rachel
26644," Yeah, yeah, what is it?",ross
26645," It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!",rachel
26646, W-What was the one right before bananas?,ross
26647," The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y’know, I thought “well, there’s mincemeat pie,” I mean that’s an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. [To Joey] Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?",rachel
26648, Y-sure!,joey
26649,  And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste.,rachel
26650," Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!",ross
26651," I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?",joey
26652," Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!",ross
26653,  Chandler!,joey
26654," Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd’s Pie!",ross
26655,  Oh man! Now she’s gonna start all over! We’re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!,joey
26656," No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up.",ross
26657, Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?,joey
26658," Yeah, it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!",ross
26659,  Vomiting stories are funny...,joey
26660," Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!",rachel
26661, Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?,joey
26662, No!,rachel
26663,  Still not hot enough!,joey
26664, Rachel?,phoebe
26665, Yeah?,rachel
26666," Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn’t give to be that can of  condensed milk.",phoebe
26667," Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.",monica
26668," Oh, yes. Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I don’t mean tight, I mean it’s not too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]",chandler
26669,  What?,chandler
26670,  What?,monica
26671,"  Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.",ross
26672," Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you.",ross
26673, You do? Why?,chandler
26674," Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.",ross
26675, What?! Why did you do that?,chandler
26676," I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter.",ross
26677, How could it not matter?!,chandler
26678," How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?",ross
26679, What about all that “friends forever” stuff?,chandler
26680," I don’t know, I-I was all high.",ross
26681, Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get Ross stoned!,monica
26682, Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!,chandler
26683," Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!",monica
26684," The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?",chandler
26685," Okay, okay, I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?",ross
26686, You! It’s not like it’s a big deal! You-you don’t still do it or anything!,monica
26687," Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?",ross
26688," Dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you’re gonna put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the-",monica
26689," Monica, leave him alone!",phoebe
26690,  Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine’s friends are dancers?! And that they’re going to be drinking alot!?,joey
26691,"  No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s so romantic.",rachel
26692, Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?,joey
26693," Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like “Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”",rachel
26694," So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?",rachel
26695, Oh I am!,joey
26696," Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!",monica
26697," Okay, fine!",ross
26698, Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?,joey
26699," Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay.",ross
26700," Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.",joey
26701," What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!",ross
26702," Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they’re all gonna’ make fun of her, do you want that?",joey
26703," Okay, okay, we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie! ",ross
26704,"  Dude, they’re not objects.",joey
26705," Just kiddin,’ I’ll talk to them, you distract Rach.",joey
26706," Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?",ross
26707, Okay...,rachel
26708," What’s up, Ross?",rachel
26709," So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?",ross
26710, Yeah!,rachel
26711, And um...You look nice today.,ross
26712," Oh no. No Ross, don’t do this.",rachel
26713, What?,ross
26714, I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.,rachel
26715,  Eh?,ross
26716," I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.",rachel
26717,  You’re alone.,ross
26718," No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you’re [pity-tone] alone, alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry.",rachel
26719,"  Ah well, can’t blame a guy for trying!",ross
26720," Oh and  Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach  or uh, or saying “mmm” and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?",joey
26721," Yeah, I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.",chandler
26722," Rachel, there you are! Come on, let’s serve that dessert already!",joey
26723," Joey, you’re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don’t get any dessert.",rachel
26724,  Really?,joey
26725," No, I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it’s trifle time!",rachel
26726," So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn’t it?",phoebe
26727, It sure is.,rachel
26728, Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?,phoebe
26729, Beef.,rachel
26730, I can’t have any. You know I don’t eat meat.  Ohhh no.,phoebe
26731," Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.",rachel
26732, Really?,monica
26733," Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!",rachel
26734, Okay.,monica
26735," Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.",rachel
26736, Well?,rachel
26737,  Mmmm! It’s good!,monica
26738, Really? How good?,rachel
26739," It’s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who’s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.",monica
26740,"  Yeah, this is so good, that I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.",chandler
26741,"  I’m gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.",monica
26742," Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.",rachel
26743, Wha? No no! Ah!   All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.,ross
26744, It tastes like feet!,ross
26745, I like it.,joey
26746, Are you kidding?,ross
26747, What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.,joey
26748," ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?",rachel
26749,"  Yes, but if it’s any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.",chandler
26750," Rachel, come here.  Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.",phoebe
26751," Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?",rachel
26752," I dunno, let’s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.",phoebe
26753,"  Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!",rachel
26754," Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.",phoebe
26755," Five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.",phoebe
26756, Ross? Let’s go.,monica
26757," Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.",ross
26758," Alright, you know what? That’s it. You’ve had your chance.",monica
26759, Wha-what?,ross
26760,  Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!,monica
26761,"   You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?",ross
26762, Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I’m sorry.,ross
26763," And Dad, y’know that mailman that you got fired? He didn’t steal your Playboys! Ross did!",monica
26764," Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing, Monica did!",ross
26765, Ross hasn’t worked at the museum for a year!,monica
26766, Monica and Chandler are living together!,ross

26768,  I love Jacques Cousteau!,phoebe
26769,  I wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle!,rachel
26770,  I wanna gooooooo!,joey
26771," I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!",ross
26772, Thank you!,chandler
26773,  I’ll talk to them!,chandler
26774," You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!",rachel
26775," Well actually, I-I didn’t eat mine. It’s still in the bathroom.",monica
26776," No it isn’t, I ate that.",joey
26777," Nope, got it and I got yours  too.",joey
26778," Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.",chandler
26779," That’s a good story, Grandpa.",rachel
26780, Hey,ross
26781," Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?",ross
26782, Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It’s about being with the people that you love.,monica
26783, That is nice and we’re done. TADA!,phoebe
26784," I dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me.",chandler
26785," Oh, here.",monica
26786, See now it feels like Christmas!,chandler
26787," … and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.",ross
26788," So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.",rachel
26789, Hey you guys.,joey
26790, Hey Joe what’s up?,chandler
26791," I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y’know, everywhere I look she’s like… ",joey
26792, I can see why that’s hard to resist.,chandler
26793, I like her so much!,joey
26794," Aw, I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way.",monica
26795, I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.,joey
26796," You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?",chandler
26797," I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she’s like OLD NEWS!",ross
26798, Hi Janine!,ross
26799, Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve?,monica
26800, Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!,monica
26801," Ah, you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you? ",chandler
26802, You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!,ross
26803, Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you.,joey
26804," Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.",ross
26805, Are you serious?,ross
26806, We are there!,monica
26807," What, what are you laughing at?",chandler
26808," Well, I used to date him, but you’re still going out with her!",rachel
26809, Bye Janine!,ross
26810, Did she just ask me out on a date?,joey
26811, I don’t think so.,chandler
26812, What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!,monica
26813," Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry, but I don’t think that was a romantic thing.",rachel
26814," Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’",joey
26815," Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.",rachel
26816, It was a dry day.,ross
26817, We are going to Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve!,monica
26818, Oh my God!,ross
26819, Oh my God!,monica
26820,  Oh my God!,chandler
26821," OK, listen I’ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It’s a show, but we’re just dancing, OK? It’s no big deal. The important thing to remember – stay cool.",joey
26822, Got it!,ross
26823, Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it!,ross
26824," Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?",ross
26825, Ross! So when is it gonna air?,joey
26826," Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.",rachel
26827," I can save you time ladies, I’m right here.",chandler
26828," Yeah, Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern you.",phoebe
26829, We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.,rachel
26830, What? That’s terrible!,chandler
26831," No-no, we do it every year!",phoebe
26832," Oh well, that makes it not terrible.",chandler
26833," No, yeah, we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily minx.",phoebe
26834," Don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search, OK?",rachel
26835," No not okay, you can’t look for Monica’s presents!",chandler
26836, But we have to!,phoebe
26837," No, you don’t have to, and you can’t because I live here too.",chandler
26838," Well then, you should look with us.",phoebe
26839, Why?,chandler
26840," Chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?",rachel
26841," No, I have a great idea for a present for her.",chandler
26842," Oh, that’s it?  A great idea!",phoebe
26843," Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?",rachel
26844," If I help, we can find ‘em faster!",chandler
26845, That’s right!,rachel
26846," Ooh ooh, we have a live one!",phoebe
26847," Oh, it’s a Macy’s bag!",rachel
26848," Ooh, who’s it for?",phoebe
26849,"  Dear losers, do you really think I’d hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they’d break you.",rachel
26850, Uh-oh. She may be onto us.,phoebe
26851, We are so gonna find them this year.,rachel
26852," Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?",chandler
26853, Yeah.,rachel
26854," You don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?",chandler
26855," Because that’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I’ve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! ",chandler
26856," Okay, here comes another camera.",monica
26857, Right. No biggie. Stay loose.,ross
26858, Why do they keep doing that?,ross
26859," If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They’ve been taping those people up there all day.",monica
26860, Right.,ross
26861," Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there?",ross
26862, Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?,monica
26863, Yeah!,ross

26877, Ha!,rachel
26878," Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?",chandler
26879," Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!",rachel
26880, Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just..  Here we go.  Looking good Gellers!,joey
26881, We know!,ross
26882," Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He’s the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.",monica
26883, Okay.,ross
26884," Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren’t wearing underpants?",monica
26885, Monica!  Would it?,ross
26886," Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you’re dancing with.",joey

26891," Hey, now you’re the one who wet his pants. ",joey

26893," Hey, I know what’ll get us up on a platform!",ross
26894, What?,monica
26895, The routine!,ross
26896," Ross, we haven’t done the routine since middle school.",monica
26897," Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he’ll wanna build us our own platform!",ross
26898, Was it really that good?,monica
26899," We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it’s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?",ross
26900," Okay, let’s do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!",monica
26901, 5 6 7 8!,monica
26902," So, do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platform next?",ross
26903, Yes! ,monica

27230," Hey, tell Dan, ‘Thanks.’",ross
27231, What?,ross
27232," I’m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny. ",rachel
27233," Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?",chandler
27234, No.,monica
27235, Seriously?,chandler
27236," Well, you tell a lot of jokes!",monica
27237," Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right?",ross
27238," Yeah, I guess.",chandler
27239,  Hey guys.,joey
27240,"  Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.",chandler
27241," No, it’s my joke, it’s mine. You can call them, they’ll tell you.",ross
27242, It’s my joke.,chandler
27243, It’s my joke.,ross
27244," Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?",joey
27245," Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.",chandler
27246, Let’s go watch it at your place.,joey
27247," Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’t want to miss when they were skinny.",chandler
27248," Chandler, Chandler, y’know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.",joey
27249," What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?",chandler
27250," No, that’s VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It’s like a lotta noise to me. I don’t know…",joey
27251," Joey, why is your cable out?",chandler
27252," I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill",joey
27253," If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?",chandler
27254," No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.",joey
27255, Whoa ho.,chandler
27256," I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .",joey
27257,"  All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?",chandler
27258, Sure.,joey
27259,  Paid your phone bill?,chandler
27260, Not so much.,joey
27261,  Hey.,phoebe
27262,  It’s only you.,monica
27263, Wh-wh-what are you doing?,phoebe
27264, We are looking at a Playboy.,rachel
27265," Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!",phoebe
27266," So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a story?",monica
27267," Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’",rachel
27268," Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.",monica
27269," Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?",phoebe
27270," You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in handy",rachel
27271," Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?",monica
27272,  I don’t know.,rachel
27273, Me neither.,monica
27274, Rachel.,phoebe
27275, What?!,monica
27276, I don’t know.  Me neither.,phoebe
27277, You forget how many great songs Heart had.,joey
27278, Yeah.,chandler
27279," You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.",ross
27280," So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.",chandler
27281," Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.",joey
27282," What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.",ross
27283, And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.,chandler
27284,  You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.,chandler
27285," Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",ross
27286," So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.",chandler
27287," Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.",ross
27288," Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.",chandler
27289," Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?",ross
27290, Yeah!,chandler
27291," Well, I’m not going to go now anyway .",ross
27292, Okay .,chandler
27293," Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.",joey
27294," Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.",joey
27295, What?!,joey
27296, Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?,joey
27297,"  She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.",monica
27298,"  He took my joke, he took it.",chandler
27299, It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.,monica
27300," You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.",chandler
27301, That’s a good idea.,monica
27302, Yeah!,chandler
27303, Do you know what’s a bad idea?,monica
27304, Picking Rachel.,chandler
27305, That’s right.  Did you hear something?,monica
27306, Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.,chandler
27307, It’s coming from the living room.,monica
27308,  I finished my book. ,joey
27309,"  Hey, you guys.",monica
27310,"  Oh, don’t you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.",monica
27311," Monica, what are you doing?",rachel
27312,"  Nothing, I’m just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day.  Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.",monica
27313, I guess it was kinda funny.,phoebe
27314,  It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn’t you pick me?,monica
27315, Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okay let’s go to lunch!,phoebe
27316," That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!",monica
27317," No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all.",phoebe
27318,"  Well, people are different.",rachel
27319," Ya, you know, Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want. Y’know, you can just walk all over her.",phoebe
27320," What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover? I’m not a pushover.",rachel
27321," Oh, okay,  you’re not a pushover.",phoebe
27322," Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go to lunch. ",rachel
27323,  You start working on that list. ,monica
27324, I cannot believe her.,rachel
27325, I know. Where do you wanna go eat?,monica
27326," Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.",rachel
27327, I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there.,monica
27328," All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.",rachel
27329, All right.,monica
27330,"  Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.",ross
27331," Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading up there.",joey
27332," Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.",ross
27333, Sure.  Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there.,joey
27334, No.,rachel
27335," No, thank you.",monica
27336,"  You guys need anything, ‘cause I’m heading up there.",joey
27337, You got it.,joey
27338," Joey, what are you doing?",monica
27339, Just being friendly. ,joey
27340," Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.",rachel
27341," Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther? ",joey
27342," Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.",joey
27343," Joey, do you work here?",monica
27344, No.,joey
27345, Yeah?,joey
27346," Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?",monica
27347," It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor and now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction.",joey
27348, So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.,chandler
27349," I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.",joey
27350," Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.",rachel
27351," Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?",ross
27352," Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird.",joey
27353," Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.",ross
27354," See, now it’s weird again.",joey
27355," I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to make a lot of money, and here’s your first tip: Don’t eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.",chandler
27356," Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right.  A smile goes a long way.  And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.",rachel
27357," Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover.",joey
27358," Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?",ross
27359," Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin.",joey
27360, Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.,rachel
27361, Okay.,phoebe
27362," So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?",monica
27363," Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.",rachel
27364, Hah!,monica
27365," That true, I am flaky.",phoebe
27366," So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?",rachel
27367," Yeah, totally.",phoebe
27368," Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance.",monica
27369," Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.",rachel
27370, That’s great. Good for you guys.,phoebe
27371, I am not high maintenance!,monica
27372, I am not a pushover!,rachel
27373, Who said you were?,phoebe
27374," Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.",phoebe
27375," Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.",joey
27376," Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part. Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’",joey
27377," Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but …",joey
27378," Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is taken.’",joey
27379," No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?",joey
27380," So, you’d hire me, right?",joey
27381," Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.",joey
27382," Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a very important issue in this month’s Playboy. I’m sure you all read about it.",joey
27383, It’s my joke.,ross
27384, It’s my joke.,chandler
27385," Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this.",ross
27386, Let’s have Monica decide.,chandler
27387, Yeah!,ross
27388, Yeah!,chandler
27389, Hey Mon.,ross
27390," Mon, get out here!",chandler
27391, Monica! ,ross
27392," Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.",chandler
27393, Why do I have to decide?,monica
27394, Because you’re the only one that can be fair.,chandler
27395, Yeah.,ross
27396, I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend.,monica
27397," Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world.",ross
27398,"  Don’t try to sway her.   I’m your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go.",chandler
27399, We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.,ross
27400," Okay, Chandler, you go first.",monica
27401," Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.",chandler
27402," Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?",monica
27403, Can I finish my story?!,chandler
27404, Do you want me to pick you?!,monica
27405," See, I would never snap at you like that.",ross
27406, Continue.,monica
27407," So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’s doctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. ",chandler
27408," Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!",ross
27409, I’m not arguing with that.,chandler
27410," All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.",monica
27411," You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!",monica
27412, It’s your joke.,ross
27413, Is not.,chandler
27414," Hi, Chandler. There you are.",monica
27415," Hi, oh hi.",chandler
27416," Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?",monica
27417,"  Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady.  Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and——generosity of spirit.",chandler
27418," Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever heard.",rachel
27419, Really? I’ve heard better.,phoebe
27420," Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.",monica
27421,  I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?,chandler
27422," Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!",monica
27423,  You’re a little high maintenance.,chandler
27424, Ahhh! You are on my list.,monica
27425," I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like … maintaining you.",chandler
27426,   I didn’t even tell him to say that. . All right you’re off my list.,monica
27427,  I’m off the list. ,chandler
27428,"  Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.",monica
27429,"  Y’know, suddenly I find you very attractive.",phoebe
27430," Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?",chandler
27431," Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so …",joey
27432, Wow! That is a bad audition.,phoebe
27433, How-how did you lose your job here?,rachel
27434," Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.",joey
27435," He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s not right.",rachel
27436," Yeah, what are ya gonna do?",joey
27437," Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’m not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No, I really shouldn’t say anything—No, I should say something to him.  Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him…",rachel
27438, What?,rachel
27439," That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.",rachel
27440, That’s great. Thanks Rach.,joey
27441," Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?",rachel
27442,"  Rach, you’re in my seat.",phoebe
27443," Oh, I’m sorry. ",rachel
27444," Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.",phoebe
27445," I pick you, Phoebe.",monica
27446," Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.",rachel
27447," Yeah, well, I kinda thought.",phoebe
27448, Hey.,chandler
27449," Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?",rachel
27450, No way.,ross
27451, I’m not answering that.,joey
27452, Joey!  No way. I’m not answering that.,chandler
27453," Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that’s  $12.75.",joey
27454, This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.,chandler
27455, Hi!,joey
27456, Oh that’s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.,joey
27457," Well, he’s not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him—He says it’s okay.  Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!",joey
27458," Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn’t free?",ross
27459, It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I’m getting more dates than ever!,joey
27460," Wait a minute, you’re only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?",rachel
27461, Yeah Joey that is so gross!,phoebe
27462, How about a scone on the house baby?,joey
27463,  I’m pretty.,phoebe
27464, Hey does anyone have any gum?,ross
27465," Oh I do!  Oh, y’know what? No.  Wait a second.  I know it’s in here somewhere.",phoebe
27466, Y’know what? I’m good! I’m good!,ross
27467,  Hey!,monica
27468, Hey!,ross
27469," Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work?",chandler
27470,"  Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can’t work if I’m sick.",monica
27471, I’m so sorry you’re sick.,chandler
27472, I’m not sick!! I don’t get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!,monica
27473," Honey, no one thinks you’re a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue. ",rachel
27474,  I have not been sick in over three years! ,monica
27475, I’m gonna grab you some tissue.,chandler
27476, I don’t need a tissue! I’m fine-d!,monica
27477, When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.,ross
27478," I’m fine-d. I’m fine-d! Y’know, it’s a really hard word to say.",monica
27479, Yes?,chandler
27480," Oh my God, Jill!",rachel
27481," Oh my God, introduce us!",chandler
27482, This is Chandler. ,rachel

27487," Don’t!!   Honey, what are you doing here?!",rachel
27488,  Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that’s bitter?,phoebe
27489," Never mind, I got it.",phoebe
27490, Wow! What did he say?,rachel
27491, Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proud of me.,rachel
27492, Rach? ,monica

27494, You bought a boat?,monica
27495, Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! ,chandler
27496," Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could’ve ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you’re gonna do.

27504,  Sorry! ,joey
27505," Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.",ross
27506, I don’t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.,ross
27507," Seriously, I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea.",phoebe
27508, I would love that job!,phoebe
27509,  Hey! What’s goin’ on?,rachel

But I’m just gonna take the-the pajmena.  And the uh, and the uh pants. Y’know what, I’m just gonna take it all away, ‘cause that way you’ll just really learn the lesson. Okay?

27843," Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?",ross
27844," Well, it doesn’t sound like it! I mean, it’s pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!",rachel
27845," Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it. I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking…",ross
27846, Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Let me give you something to think about! ,rachel
27847, Oh wait—hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.,ross
27848," Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that.",rachel
27849, Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!,ross
27850, What?!,rachel
27851," No, I mean, look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.",ross
27852," Wow. I, I don’t even know what to say. Thank you. ",rachel
27853, You’re welcome. ,ross
27854, Oh my God! Are-are you crying?,monica

27865, No! Barry and Mindy.,phoebe
27866," Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross.  Who-who’s Barry and Mindy?",joey
27867, Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.,rachel
27868," Ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her?",joey
27869," Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.",rachel
27870, Why did they get divorced?,monica
27871," Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?",rachel
27872," I know what you mean, I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced.",ross
27873, Which time?,phoebe
27874," The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian.",ross
27875,  I can’t. I keep seeing it the good way.,joey
27876," I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay.  Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything else physical.",ross
27877, Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.,chandler
27878," And what if I was still fat?  Well, you wouldn’t be dating me, that’s for sure.",monica
27879, Sure I would!,chandler
27880," What, you guys really think that I’m that shallow?",chandler

27882," Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives!  Oh-hey, there’s Carol again!",joey
27883," What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job’s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don’t have to wear a tie.",chandler
27884, What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?,phoebe
27885, What?!,ross

27887," Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.",phoebe
27888, Well why didn’t you take the job?,rachel
27889," Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y’know that if I’d work with stocks, I’d have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.",phoebe
27890," Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we’d still hang out?",ross
27891,  Oh my God! Rachel Green?,ross

27910,  Oh yeah? Okay.,rachel
27911,  Okay.,ross
27912, But! Don’t you have to give him his money back?,rachel
27913," Uh-huh.  Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no p0rn for you.  Okay, let’s go see Monica!",ross

27928, Really?,joey
27929, Ehh.,chandler
27930," Maybe Joey doesn’t have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?",monica
27931," That’s an idea!  Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?",joey
27932," No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!",monica
27933, That’s great! That would be great! Let’s do that!,joey

28337, Chandler!,monica

29449," I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.",rachel
29450," Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.  Maybe I have to pee again. ",rachel
29451," Y’know what? I-I-I… I-I have had enough of this! Y’know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me, frankly…",ross

29485, I mean think about all the money that you’re gonna make!,monica
29486, Why? What?,ross
29487," Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?",monica
29488," No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go, y’know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah, he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in fossils, huh?",ross
29489, I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.,rachel
29490," Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings  in his ear.",ross
29491, Ross.,chandler
29492," Oh, come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s need—he’s got like a hearing aide y’know, ‘cause-‘cause y’know, ‘cause he’s all old, and…",ross
29493," Really? That okay, that’s great.",ross
29494," All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.",ross
29495," But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it.",ross
29496, Ohh! A man with a plan!,ross
29497," Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!",phoebe
29498," I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin’ up about something… Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he’s just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi b*st*rd, I’ll…",joey
29499,"  Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me.  Yeah I know; we’d be great together!",phoebe
29500, Hey! So I’m back.,joey
29501," Joey Tribbiani! From the wall!  Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh?  Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I’m ready to go back up on the wall I’m the star of a new TV show.",joey
29502," Oh well, it’s not on TV yet.",joey
29503," Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? ",joey
29504," So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet?",phoebe

29515, What?! No! Why?!,rachel
29516," No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?",phoebe
29517, I didn’t know you could get married here.,rachel
29518," This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!  I mean you’d have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch. ",monica
29519, Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?,rachel
29520," Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list",rachel
29521, What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even engaged.,monica
29522," Yeah, but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else, y’know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. ",phoebe
29523," Yeah hon, it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it.",rachel
29524," Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.",monica
29525, I’m gonna do it too!,rachel
29526, Me too!,phoebe
29527," Really? Who would, who would you marry?",rachel
29528," I don’t know, I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know?",phoebe

29616,"  I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.",monica

29623, Okay.,chandler

29631, So did Heldi show you the place?,phoebe
29632," Yeah, it’s beautiful.",chandler
29633, I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!,phoebe

29638, Great! ,joey
29639," Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!",chandler
29640," Now, have you told anyone else?",phoebe
29641," No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.",chandler
29642, You told me.,phoebe
29643," Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",chandler
29644," Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.",phoebe
29645, Me too.,chandler

29653, How rude.,ross
29654," Oh, I’m sorry. You wanna bite? ",joey
29655, So how are things going with Paul?,phoebe
29656," Good. Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy. Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",rachel
29657, That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.,phoebe
29658, So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?,rachel
29659, No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,phoebe
29660, Hi!,rachel
29661,  Watch this.,phoebe

29674, What?! Why?!,ross
29675," Please, I think you know why.",phoebe
29676, I can’t think of anything.,ross
29677," Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.",phoebe
29678," Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?",ross
29679, Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?,phoebe
29680, I guess it could.,ross
29681, Well then I think that’s it.,phoebe
29682," Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.",ross
29683," Oh, if that’s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.",phoebe
29684," Yeah that’s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.",rachel
29685," Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?",rachel
29686," Yeah that’s great Paul, but y’know I wanna know what——Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y’know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.",rachel
29687," No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! Y’know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!",rachel
29688," Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painful time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.",rachel
29689," Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm… The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets?",rachel
29690," All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!",rachel
29691, Okay.,rachel
29692, All right.,rachel

29695, Oh!,rachel
29696," Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’s beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?",rachel
29697, What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!,rachel
29698," My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I wouldn’t do that!",rachel
29699, Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too and I can’t find the perfect ring!  Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring!  It’s a beautiful selection. ,chandler
29700," Okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know? Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.",phoebe
29701," Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.",chandler
29702, Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?,phoebe
29703," Yeah, I’m gonna stick with the ring.  Oh, this one’s nice!  I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?",chandler
29704,"  Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.",phoebe
29705," Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.",chandler
29706," Or not, whatever.",phoebe
29707," Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?",chandler
29708,"  Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How much is it?",chandler
29709," Chandler, I-I will handle this!  How much is it?",phoebe

29714," Okay.  Listen, I’m sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.",phoebe
29715, I’ll give you $1 for them.,phoebe
29716," Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?",ross
29717, No.,joey
29718, Remember? You-you were eating pizza.,ross
29719, Yeah.,joey
29720," Okay. Well, apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.",ross
29721," Oh, we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!",joey
29722," Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y’know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.",ross

29762," Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!",chandler
29763," I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.",phoebe
29764, Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.,chandler

29784," I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!",rachel
29785, Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’t mean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming.,rachel

29790," No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye.  Look, this is the most important thing I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.",chandler
29791, Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.,phoebe
29792, I can’t do that.,chandler
29793, Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring.,phoebe
29794, There he is! ,phoebe
29795, Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.,chandler
29796," Wow! You’re good! After this, we should solve crimes.",phoebe

29799, It is your office.,phoebe
29800, John?,phoebe
29801,  Here he is.,phoebe
29802,"  Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I’m gonna need to have that back.  But, in exchange I’m willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.  Ew.",chandler
29803, Wow! I would trade.,phoebe
29804, No-no! This is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring. You don’t want to break her heart now do you?,chandler
29805," Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?",phoebe
29806," Yeah, she’s dying… Of a cough apparently.",chandler
29807," Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…",phoebe

30056," Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor…",phoebe
30057, Glove salesman!,joey
30058, Good one! Yeah.,phoebe
30059, This is terrible. What am I going to do?,chandler
30060," Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track.",phoebe
30061," That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.",chandler
30062, Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment! Convince her that you’re a little coward!,phoebe
30063," I can do that, I’ve had 30 years of practice.",chandler
30064," Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! ",joey
30065,  I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!,monica

30075,  Hi guys!,monica
30076, Hey!,joey
30077, Hey!,chandler
30078, What are you up too?,monica
30079," Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites.  Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.",chandler
30080,"  Yeah, Big Brother.",joey
30081, Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet.,monica
30082," Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?",chandler
30083, Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!,monica
30084, Eh…,chandler
30085, Okay well that’s good to know.,monica
30086,  The Mr. Bowmont’s here!!! ,joey
30087," Sure, I love this part! ",monica
30088, Richard!,monica
30089," Ohh… Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what’s up?",monica
30090," Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?",monica
30091, What uh—What did you—What?!,monica
30092, Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here!,monica
30093, Oh God…  Why don’t they put chairs back here?!,monica
30094, What the… Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three years ago?!,monica
30095, What were you doing in Africa?,monica
30096," Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I… I’m sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.",monica
30097," Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I’m the one that’s making him wait!",monica
30098, Yeah!,monica
30099, Why? Because of the government.,monica
30100," Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married.",rachel
30101," I know, they’re gonna be so happy together.",phoebe
30102," Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?",rachel
30103, Not that often!,phoebe
30104, No! I’m so happy for them!,rachel
30105, Me too! So happy for them!,phoebe
30106, I’m so happy and not at all jealous.,rachel
30107," Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!",phoebe
30108," I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing.",rachel
30109, Totally. I’m like 90/10.,phoebe
30110, Yeah me too.,rachel
30111," Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?",joey
30112,"  Wh—no, but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.",rachel
30113," So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t really believe that do you?",monica
30114," Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!",chandler
30115," Yeah, but that’s pigs not people!",monica
30116," If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.",chandler
30117, Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?,monica
30118," Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.",chandler
30119, Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!,monica
30120, Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!,chandler
30121, Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!,monica
30122,"  It’s okay, I got a plan.",chandler
30123, We’re gonna find love!,rachel
30124, Definitely!,phoebe
30125," Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.",rachel
30126, What do you mean?,phoebe
30127," Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other.",rachel
30128, You mean a backup?,phoebe
30129, Exactly!,rachel
30130," Yeah, yeah I got that.",phoebe
30131, You do?,rachel
30132, Hm-mmm.,phoebe
30133, Who?,rachel
30134, Joey.,phoebe
30135, Joey?!,rachel
30136, Yeah!,phoebe
30137, Are you serious?!,rachel
30138," Yeah, I locked him years ago!",phoebe
30139," Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40, you’re gonna marry Joey.",rachel
30140," Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.",phoebe
30141," Oh, seriously?",rachel
30142," Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were… ",phoebe
30143, Charming.,rachel
30144," Well hey, it’s just a backup.",phoebe
30145, Yeah.,rachel
30146, Hey Monica!,joey
30147, Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?,monica
30148," This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?",joey
30149," Yeah, it’s great.",monica
30150," Whoa-whoa, what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain!",joey
30151, I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in a dead-end relationship!,monica
30152, Chandler giving you a hard time huh?,joey
30153," It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just that I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time!",monica
30154," Well, you know Chandler.",joey
30155, No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s like something’s changed.,monica
30156, Maybe you changed?,joey
30157, I didn’t change!,monica
30158, Maybe that’s the problem.,joey
30159, What?!,monica
30160," Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.",joey
30161, Is that some kind of boat talk?,monica
30162, I don’t know!  I haven’t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.,joey
30163, What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around for nothing?,monica
30164," Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!",joey
30165,  Well there’s some people who do want to marry me.,monica
30166, There are?,joey
30167, Yeah! Richard!,monica
30168, R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?!,joey
30169, That’s right.,monica
30170, Chandler loves marriage!!,joey
30171, You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!,monica
30172, You got that from what I said?!,joey
30173, What happened you guys?,ross
30174, Rach!,ross
30175, Hey you!,rachel
30176," Hey, come on in.",ross
30177," Oh thank you. Hey y’know, I’m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.",rachel
30178," Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.",ross
30179," Yeah, love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it?",rachel
30180, I guess so.,ross
30181," So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we’re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, ""What’s that?!""",rachel
30182, Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.,ross
30183, Exactly.,rachel
30184," Ohh, yeah I already have one.",ross
30185, What? Who?,rachel
30186, Phoebe.,ross
30187," Phoebe?! Wait a—but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.",rachel
30188," Ohh, I don’t think so.",ross
30189," Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!",rachel
30190," That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.",ross
30191, Where the hell have you been?!,joey
30192, I was making a coconut phone with the professor.,chandler
30193, Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!,joey
30194, What?!,chandler
30195," Yeah! Yeah, I’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these  damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep flying off!",joey
30196, My—Oh my God!,chandler
30197, I know! They suck!!,joey
30198, He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m supposed to do that!,chandler
30199, I know!,joey
30200, Well what… Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna go over there; I’m gonna kick his ass!  Will you help me?!,chandler
30201," Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!",joey
30202, You’re right.,chandler
30203, Yeah!,joey
30204, Okay.  I’m gonna get the ring! I’m gonna get the ring!  I’m gonna go find her and  I’m just going to propose!,chandler

30209," Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.",joey
30210, Hi.,monica
30211, I don’t know why I’m here.,monica
30212, I don’t know.,monica
30213,  Chandler is such an idiot!,monica
30214," Yeah, I’ll have a scotch…",monica
30215,  Still smoking cigars?,monica
30216," No that’s, that’s okay.",monica
30217," Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.",monica
30218, Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new eye doctor.,monica
30219, Edward Nevski?,monica
30220, No.,monica
30221, But getting over was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.,monica
30222, Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!,rachel
30223," Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I’ve already lost Chandler!",phoebe
30224, What?!,rachel
30225,  Hey!,joey
30226,  Hey!,ross
30227, Phoebe! We’re both  your backup?!,joey
30228," Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!",ross
30229, I don’t—Look I don’t know what you’re complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!,phoebe
30230, No we weren’t!,joey
30231, I was not!,ross
30232," Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married!",phoebe
30233, Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!,rachel
30234, Pick me!!,joey
30235, No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid!,ross
30236," All right well let’s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat—This is hard!",phoebe
30237," This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!",joey
30238," Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!",ross
30239," No wait! Just—Okay—Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don’t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.",phoebe
30240," Oh God, Phoebe!",rachel
30241,  I’m talking about massages.,phoebe
30242, Oh.,rachel
30243," Okay, y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin  and I’m gonna right Ross on the other napkin  and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?",rachel
30244, Okay that’s fair.,joey
30245, All right.,ross
30246, Good!,phoebe
30247, Pick one.,rachel
30248, Left!  Thank you.,phoebe
30249, You’re welcome.,rachel
30250,  Ross!,phoebe
30251,  Joey!  We should just switch.,rachel

30257," Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig s*x over lunch, I don’t want that!",monica
30258," Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!",monica
30259, Nothing.  I don’t kn—Umm. I don’t know. Umm…,monica
30260," Y’know, I-I… I have to figure…some st—Y’know, some stuff before I can…",monica
30261, Where is she? I’m not scared of you! ,chandler
30262,"  Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!",chandler
30263, Well where did she go?,chandler
30264," Oh my God, I can’t believe this! Y’know, I thought…I thought you were a good guy.",chandler
30265, Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?,chandler
30266, Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!,chandler
30267, And what does she have to think about? I love her!,chandler
30268," But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she’d be surprised!",chandler
30269," It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake!  I was gonna propose tonight.",chandler
30270, Yeah I even  got a ring.  Did you get a ring?,chandler
30271, Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.,chandler
30272, Dude!,joey
30273," I can’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!",chandler
30274, She’s gone.,joey
30275, What?,chandler
30276, She’s gone. She had a bag and she left.,joey
30277, What are you talking about?,chandler
30278," She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.",joey
30279, Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?!,chandler
30280," I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believe me.",joey
30281, Well where… Where did she go?,chandler
30282, To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But if I were you I would.,joey
30283, I can’t believe I ruined this.,chandler
30284, I am so sorry man.,joey
30285, You wanted it to be a surprise.,monica
30286, Oh my God.,chandler
30287, Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.  As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!,monica
30288," Okay!  Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought…  Wait a minute, I-I can do this.  I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.  And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  Monica, will you marry me?",chandler
30289, Yes.,monica

30476, Paris?,monica
30477, We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .,chandler

30494, What?! What’s wrong with my eyes.,joey
30495, They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom in there.  Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.,phoebe
30496, And that’ll get rid of my wisdom?,joey
30497, Maybe just 10 minutes for you.,phoebe
30498," Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!",chandler
30499, Yes.,monica
30500," Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want to talk to anyone, especially me?",rachel

30508,"  Ahh, third base.",chandler
30509, It’s all everybody at the party could talk about!,monica
30510," Monica, y’know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!",rachel
30511,  We had a caricaturist!,monica
30512, Oh!!,rachel
30513, ,phoebe
30514," Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.",rachel

30518, Got me. ,ross
30519," All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain’t gonna happen!",rachel
30520, I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!,monica
30521," I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!",rachel
30522," Oh, is that why you did it in the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!",monica
30523," Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off.",ross
30524,  Why to save your dignity my man.,chandler
30525,"  Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?",rachel
30526," I don’t know! I don’t—maybe you’re feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’t stand the fact that your formerly fat friend is getting married before you!",monica
30527," Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let’s go have s*x!",rachel
30528,  I can’t believe you’re gonna have s*x on my engagement night!!,monica
30529," Well, somebody should. ",chandler
30530," Look uh, if we’re gonna do this…",ross
30531," We’re not gonna do this, all right? She’s just gonna think that we’re doin’ it.",rachel
30532," Oh, I see, so everybody wins.",ross
30533, Who is it?,rachel
30534,"  It’s Monica, open up!",monica
30535, Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! ,rachel
30536, Oww!,ross
30537," Yeah, you like that baby?  May we help you?",rachel
30538," I just wanted to say that I hope you do have s*x tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I’m going to announce that I’m pregnant!",monica
30539, How is that ever going to happen?!,chandler
30540," All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!",rachel
30541, I know why!,monica
30542, No you don’t know why!,rachel
30543, Okay! Why?!,monica
30544, Because! Because I was sad.,rachel
30545, What do you mean?,monica
30546," Look, I am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!",rachel
30547,"  I don’t care, she slept with me.",chandler
30548," Anyway sweetie, I am, I’m so sorry I ruined your night.",rachel

30552,"  And uh, Rachel.",ross

30565,  Oww!,monica
30566, What’s the matter honey?,chandler
30567," I don’t know, my hand feels weird. I guess it’s because, I’m engaged!  How long before it starts getting annoying?",monica
30568, It starts?,phoebe
30569," Yeah, so let’s get started on the wedding plans!",rachel
30570, Okay! ,monica
30571,  Already?!,chandler
30572," Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music…",rachel
30573," Oh, I got some thoughts on that.",chandler
30574," Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks…",rachel
30575," Take it from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.",ross
30576,  Okay! ,monica
30577, What in God’s name is that?!,chandler
30578," Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forth grade!",ross
30579," This baby has got everything. Take y’know, locations for instance.  First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.",monica
30580, That is so smart!  Break it off. Break it off now.,phoebe
30581, And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let’s take a look at… ,ross
30582, Hey! Ross!,phoebe
30583," Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?",ross
30584," I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica and Chandler.",phoebe
30585," Oh my God! Of course, of course.  Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other’s hometowns? Why don’t you…   Wh-what’s going on?",ross
30586," Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?",phoebe
30587," Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?",ross
30588, Nothing—Why?!,phoebe
30589," Phoebe, you said it was urgent!",ross
30590, Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.,phoebe
30591, Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?,ross
30592,"  Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?",phoebe
30593," All right, so I haven’t cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.",monica
30594, Okay.,rachel
30595," All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.",monica
30596, Aw.,rachel
30597," A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.",monica
30598," Well, you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t play anymore and Derrick…  And Derrick is a name I shouldn’t know.",chandler
30599,"  Hey Mon, do you have another pillow?  Y’know, something a little snugglyer?",joey
30600, Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?,chandler
30601," Well, the duck…",joey
30602, What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!,rachel
30603," Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!",joey
30604," Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?",chandler
30605," Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!",monica
30606, Okay.,chandler
30607, Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?,monica
30608, Centerpieces!,chandler
30609, Yeah! Roses or Lilies? ,monica
30610," Definitely roses.  Well, I just think they’re a little more weddingy.  But Lilies are the clear choice.",chandler
30611, Oh my God! It’s like one mind.,monica
30612, Uh-huh!,chandler
30613,"  Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I’m gonna get cranky!",joey
30614," Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!",rachel
30615," Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!",joey
30616, What?!,rachel
30617," All right, I’m gonna go! ",joey
30618," Now Joey, what did the duck do?!",rachel
30619, I don’t know! But he did not eat your face cream!,joey
30620," Hey little buddy, how are you feeling?  What the hell is in that face cream?  That’s so soft.  Pillowcases!   Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar… The vicar?  …wouldn’t be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his… Whoa!  Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book! ",joey
30621," Uh, Phoebe…",ross
30622," Oh Ross, hi.",phoebe
30623," Phoebe, what are you doing?",ross
30624," I’m sorry, I’m with a client right now.",phoebe
30625, Phoebe!,ross
30626," Okay, let’s talk outside.",phoebe
30627," Phoebe, you can’t massage people in my apartment!",ross
30628, What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s!,phoebe
30629, And they knew about it?,ross
30630,"  Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?",phoebe
30631," Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!",ross
30632," Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is!",phoebe
30633," The big deal is I don’t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle—beer! Cold beer.",ross
30634," Hey Joey, what ‘cha doing?",rachel
30635, Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on?,joey
30636, No.,rachel
30637, Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?,joey
30638," Joey, did you eat my face cream?",rachel
30639, Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours.,joey
30640," Joey,  where did you learn that word?",rachel
30641," Where do you think,  Zelda?",joey
30642,  You found my book?!,rachel
30643, Yeah I did!,joey
30644," Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!",rachel
30645," Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn’t have, but you got p0rn!",joey
30646," Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. ",rachel
30647, You got p0rn!,joey
30648, Hello.,ross
30649," Uh no-no, she-she’s out for the night.",ross
30650," Can I, can I help you with something?",ross
30651,  Yes I am.,ross
30652," Oh yeah, I should probably call them.",chandler
30653," Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story.",chandler
30654," Oh dad, really you don’t need to…",monica
30655, What a sweet story.,chandler
30656," Well, at least you’re not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.",monica
30657," Anyway, we’re really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we’ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.  What?",monica
30658, What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don’t you?,monica
30659, I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!,monica
30660, You bought the beach house when I was 23!,monica
30661, What about when I started dating Chandler?,monica
30662, Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. ,chandler
30663, I can’t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!,monica
30664," Okay! Now, I’m going to touch you.  Ohh, that’s soft. ",ross
30665, I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?,monica
30666," I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  Dollywood.",chandler
30667, Well what happened at dinner?,rachel
30668, My parents spent the money for our wedding!,monica
30669,  My God! What did you order?!,phoebe
30670," Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!",rachel
30671," Honey, it’s gonna be okay.",chandler
30672, No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,monica
30673," No, y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need, you don’t need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. ",rachel
30674," Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we’re gonna get married.",chandler
30675, Do you even understand what off the rack means?!,rachel
30676," Look, why don’t you just pay for it yourself?",phoebe
30677, How? I don’t have any money.,monica
30678," Well, I have some.",chandler
30679, How much?,monica
30680," Well, close to… ",chandler
30681, Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!,monica
30682, Well what?! How-how much is it?!,rachel
30683, It’s enough for wedding scenario eight.,monica
30684, Ohh!  Really?!,rachel
30685,"  How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!",monica

30730, You do?!,monica
30731," Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do.",chandler
30732," Oh, you’re so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?",monica

30737," Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",chandler
30738, What else did you think about?,monica
30739," Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.",chandler
30740,"  Y’know what? I-I don’t want a big, fancy wedding.",monica
30741, Sure you do.,chandler
30742," No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.",monica

30806, Great! I’m finally getting into this sailing stuff.,joey
30807," Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?",monica
30808, Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!,joey
30809," If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?",phoebe
30810," Oh, it’s great! It’s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. ",joey
30811," Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that.",chandler
30812," Y’know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.",rachel
30813, You could?,joey
30814, Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.,rachel
30815, Your own boat?,phoebe

30827," Well, did-did you correct him?",chandler
30828," No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.",ross
30829," This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.",monica
30830, Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.,ross
30831," Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.",monica
30832, Yeah.,ross
30833, He hates to lose.,monica
30834," Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand.",chandler
30835, You’re not a lefty?,ross
30836, Does anybody know me?!,chandler
30837, What’s wrong Phoebe?,monica
30838, I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!,phoebe
30839, No!! Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!,monica
30840,"  Because I’m normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.",phoebe
30841," Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?",ross
30842, Don’t worry about it Pheebs.,chandler
30843, No one got me an engagement present.,ross
30844," Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. ",phoebe
30845, An old cookie?,chandler
30846,  This is what happens when you don’t register for gifts!,monica
30847," See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.",phoebe
30848, We can’t accept this.,chandler
30849, Why not?,phoebe
30850, ‘Cause it’s gross.,chandler
30851, No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.,monica
30852, Really?!,phoebe
30853, Yeah! I bet I can do it.,monica
30854," Okay, we owe you a present.",chandler
30855, Two! I’ve been engaged twice!,ross
30856,  Look at this clown! Just because he’s got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.  Get out of the way jackass!  Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?,joey
30857, That is the Coast Guard.,rachel
30858, What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there. ,joey
30859," Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the lesson yet.",rachel
30860, All right.,joey
30861," Okay, I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?",rachel
30862," Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let’s start sailing, and I want to go over there  where that boatload of girls is!  Yo-ho-ho!",joey
30863," Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though,  what’s this called?",rachel
30864," Uh, boat rope.",joey
30865, Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?,rachel
30866," Uh, rub it?",joey
30867, No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?,rachel
30868," I’d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh…",joey
30869," Time’s up, now you're dead.",rachel
30870, And deaf!,joey
30871," Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! ",rachel
30872, Yes.,joey
30873," Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game, Joey, you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!",rachel
30874, I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.,joey
30875," All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.",monica
30876, You do?,phoebe
30877," You don’t?  Well, that’s the difference between a professional and a layman.",monica
30878, That and arrogance.,phoebe
30879,  Hey.,joey
30880, Hey! How was sailing?,monica
30881," I don’t want to talk about it. Y’know, you could’ve at least saved me a whole cookie. ",joey
30882,  Women are mean!!! ,joey
30883, I can’t believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb.  I wish you a long and happy marriage.,phoebe
30884,  Hey.,ross
30885, Hey! How was it?,monica
30886," Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand…",ross
30887, I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.,chandler
30888, And what did he ask you not to call him?,ross
30889," Daddy. All right look, here’s the story.  Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy.  So I take off my glasses and that’s when it happened.",chandler
30890, Guys?,chandler
30891, Over here. ,ross
30892, Oh my God Chandler! I can’t believe it!,monica
30893, I know.,chandler
30894, You gave my father a lap dance!,monica
30895, Why do they put so much steam in there?!,chandler
30896, ‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room.,ross
30897, Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?,chandler
30898," Come on, it’s not that big a deal!",phoebe
30899, Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things.,chandler
30900," Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?",ross
30901," Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years!",monica
30902, I don’t want him to tell this story for years.,chandler
30903," Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.",ross
30904, I wasn’t escaping.,monica
30905, Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?,ross
30906, I was trying to help out a squirrel.,monica
30907, You were trying to eat it!,ross
30908, If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!,chandler
30909,"  Come on.  Hello?  I’m sorry you have the wrong number.   Okay, I’ll call you later dad. I love you. ",monica
30910,"  All right, I’m off to see your dad.",chandler
30911," Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed?",ross
30912,"  Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.",rachel
30913," Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face—And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass. ",chandler
30914,  Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?,ross
30915," I don’t know. Y’know, they didn’t get us anything.",rachel

30923, What? I was just trying to teach you.,rachel
30924," Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!",joey
30925, Yeeeeeep… Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took me out on her dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all.,ross
30926," Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn’t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.",rachel
30927, You have to respect the sea! ,ross
30928," Look Joey, I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.",rachel
30929," Does a good teacher say, ""Put down the beer pinhead!?""",joey
30930," Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?",rachel
30931, Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?,joey
30932," Yeah, I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom!",rachel
30933, Well it hit me anyway! And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.,joey
30934," All right, y’know what? I-I’m sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.",rachel
30935, You won’t boss me around anymore?,joey
30936, I won’t boss you around.,rachel
30937, And you’ll be nice?,joey
30938," And, I’ll be nice.",rachel
30939, And you’ll be topless?,joey
30940, And—Joey!,rachel
30941, Do you want me to learn?!,joey
30942," Okay, here’s batch 22. Oh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.",monica
30943, Let’s give it a shot.,ross
30944," Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.",monica
30945," Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?",phoebe
30946," No, just a Friday night.",monica
30947," Oh, these are pretty good.",ross
30948," Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.",phoebe
30949, Which one was that?,ross
30950, The ones we had right after you almost threw up.,monica
30951, Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16.  I’m okay.,ross
30952, Are there any more from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work off of those.,phoebe
30953," Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh…  It’s batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! ",ross
30954," Okay Joey honey, you’re doing really good! All right, now I’m just gonna need you to step to the port side.  Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?",rachel

30957, Nope.,joey
30958," It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a tough one.",rachel
30959, I don’t know why you just don’t say left.,joey
30960," Okay, go to the left.  The left!",rachel
30961, Huh?,joey
30962,  Just sit over there!! ,rachel
30963,"  Okay! Okay, you’re yelling again! See that?",joey
30964," No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.",rachel
30965," Oh, y’know what? Since I’m here, I think I’m gonna have me a little beer on the port side. ",joey
30966," Okay Joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? ",rachel
30967," Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there.",joey
30968," Joey, come on! We just went over this! ",rachel
30969," Oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!",joey
30970,"  No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!",rachel
30971, All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you taking your top off! I quit!,joey
30972, What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit!,rachel
30973, Why not?!,joey
30974, Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do not quit!,rachel
30975, Greens? I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!,joey
30976," Oh my God, wait did I—I just said Greens don’t quit didn’t I?   Did I just say Greens don’t quit?!",rachel
30977, Yes! Yes! You did and you’re still yelling at me!,joey
30978," No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you, I’m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, oh I’m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I’ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh, Joey, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.",rachel
30979," Well, hey I did learn.",joey
30980, Really?,rachel
30981, Yeah! Come on.,joey
30982, Awww…,rachel
30983," Yeah, it’s okay. I know what a mainsail is.  I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.",joey
30984, Left.,rachel
30985, Damnit!,joey
30986," Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.",phoebe
30987, Looking up?,ross
30988," Oh yeah—No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for sure.",phoebe
30989," Well, I’ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I’m not gonna be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.",monica
30990," Aww, Pheeb, come on isn’t there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?",ross

30992," That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit, I’ve got shuffleboard that day.",ross
30993, That’s what you think.,phoebe
30994," Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? Wouldn’t they have the recipe?",monica

31420," Yeah well, maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.",phoebe
31421," Well, I don’t think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that’s just because I am not emotionally unavailable!",ross
31422, You think he’s emotionally unavailable?,phoebe

31456," Oh. Y’know, he hums while he does other stuff to.",phoebe
31457," Yeah, we're better off without them.",ross
31458," And y’know, even if they break up again, you’d better not let him in your sad men’s club!",phoebe

31476, I hope it’s you.,phoebe
31477, Me too!,rachel

31479," Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!",rachel
31480," Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine…",monica
31481, Yes!!! Oh!!,phoebe
31482, Hypothetically!,rachel
31483, Still.,phoebe
31484, If Phoebe were my maid of honor…,monica
31485, Uh-hmm.,rachel
31486," Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.",monica
31487, Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.,rachel
31488," Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours?",phoebe
31489,"  Well that’s the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!",monica
31490, Wh-why is that the best part?,phoebe
31491, Because then I don’t have to!,monica
31492," Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that…",rachel

31518, Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s!,rachel
31519, But why does it even matter?!,phoebe
31520, Why does it matter so much to you?!,rachel
31521, Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry!,phoebe
31522, What-what if I marry Ross—Or Joey?,rachel
31523,"  You wouldn’t! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve done it at least twice!",phoebe
31524, Yeah but Phoebe…,rachel
31525," And no, oh please, oh please let me finish.  Oh I guess that was it.",phoebe

31603, You’re Lewis Posin.,monica
31604, Who?,chandler
31605," Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?",monica
31606, Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!,chandler
31607," No! But because he thought I was too faaaaa….  And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.",monica
31608, What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.,chandler
31609," No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.",monica
31610," Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you fell in love with!",chandler
31611," Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.",joey
31612," No, 10 is the highest.",ross
31613, Why is 10 the highest?,joey

31620," Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.",rachel
31621,"  Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!",joey
31622, Thanks!,rachel
31623," Yes, very nice Rachel.",ross

31636," Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…",rachel
31637, Go!,ross
31638," Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage as…  Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh… I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six-year-olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six-year-old.",rachel
31639," Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass  to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.",rachel
31640, Wow.  Good speech.,joey
31641," Yeah, it really was!",ross

31643," Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next  although I really don’t see the point.",ross
31644, Yeah.,joey

31665, Why-why would I care about that?,ross
31666," No reason, I’m just saying that uh… That’s where I’ll be.",joey
31667," As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.",chandler
31668, Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.,monica
31669, I would really love it if I could do both.,chandler
31670," All right, I…I have to ask.",monica
31671, What?,chandler
31672, Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?,monica

31675, A hundred and forty-five pounds.,chandler
31676, In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s not the point.,monica
31677," Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!",chandler
31678," Well… That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.",monica
31679," Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.",chandler
31680, How?,monica
31681, You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!,chandler
31682," What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different. I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are!",monica
31683," Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.  See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.",chandler
31684, Keep going.,monica
31685, So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.,chandler
31686, Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?,monica
31687, I’d carry you around in my pocket.,chandler
31688, I love you. ,monica

31693," That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once.  Oh, you mean today.",phoebe
31694," Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours.",rachel
31695, Oh yeah!,phoebe
31696," Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y’know just in case…",rachel
31697, Oh that’s so sweet thanks.,phoebe
31698," Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride.  And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here’s a little purse that I found.  Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.",rachel
31699, Ohh.,phoebe
31700," And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry at weddings.  I’m just gonna grab a couple of these.",rachel
31701, This stuff is great!,phoebe
31702," Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue.  Yeah…",rachel
31703," Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s maid of honor.",phoebe
31704, You do? Why?,rachel
31705, Because I think it means more to you.,phoebe
31706," But Pheebs, y’know you earned it.",rachel
31707," It's fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking about since you were what, 14? ",phoebe
31708," No, I was ten. I just developed early.",rachel
31709,  Man alive!,phoebe
31710,"  Hey, what’s going on?",monica

31712," Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.",phoebe
31713,"  Ohh, wow! That’s great!  Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we’ll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I’m so excited! ",monica
31714," Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she’s gonna be yours. ",rachel

31724, What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?!,rachel
31725," Yeah—Hey, don’t worry, she’s a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I’m not looking for a serious relationship; that’d be great.",joey
31726, Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!,rachel
31727," Just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I’m a loner—No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up with the likes of me.",joey
31728," Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember, can’t I just tell her you’re a pig?",rachel
31729," Hey, I’m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He’d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he’d make extras and leave ‘em for me.",joey

31760, Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won’t be so bad.,monica
31761," What do you think, she’s just gonna sit there quietly? You don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!",chandler
31762," Oh my God, she’s not gonna like the chicken that night either, is she?!",monica
31763, Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what? She’s probably not gonna even want to come.,chandler
31764, Really?,monica

31826,"  Yeah, look how that worked out.",joey

31828, No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! ,ross

31830," Well, fine. Fine! If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I’ll go up there and defend it myself!  And don’t you follow me!",ross

31845, How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!,joey
31846, What about Game 1 of the Series?,joey
31847, You shut up!  I love arguing with her.  I’ll be right back.,joey

31863," No, just a regular old flying dwarf.",phoebe
31864, Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?,ross
31865," Oh-oh, you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps,  perhaps Dr. Chester Stock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?",ross
31866," Ah… Ah…Get out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views on evolution?",ross

31877, Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?,phoebe

31900," No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!",chandler
31901, Kinda like your barcalounger.,monica
31902, Is that what you’re thinking about right now?,chandler
31903, I never stop thinking about it.,monica
31904," Janice, I’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight.",chandler
31905," Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.",chandler
31906, Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!,monica
31907, Because Chandler still has feelings for you!,monica
31908, Say again?,chandler
31909, That’s right. That’s right. And that is why you can’t stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding.,monica
31910," Feelings, such strong feelings.",chandler
31911," I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.",monica
31912,"  Don’t sweat it, I’ve got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I’ve got this little baby  to shine in people’s eye——Okay, see you later.",ross

31914,  Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!,ross
31915," No, no, no. No-no-no.",chandler
31916," What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?",ross
31917," No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.",chandler
31918, What? That's like insanely easy!,ross
31919," Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .",chandler
31920," It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.",monica
31921, What? You forgot fourteen states?,ross
31922, Nobody cares about the Dakotas. ,monica
31923," Oh, okay, time's up!",chandler
31924," All right, I got 48.",rachel
31925," Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?",chandler
31926," Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.",phoebe
31927," Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, Joey?",chandler
31928, Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.,joey
31929," Wow, how many have you got?",ross
31930, Fifty-six!,joey
31931, Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports team!,joey
31932, Does South Oregon have a sports-team?  There you go.,chandler
31933,  How come we have one extra place setting?,rachel
31934, 'Cause you invited your assistant.,monica
31935," Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.",rachel
31936, Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.,monica
31937," Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... your food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.",rachel
31938," Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake,  but I still do.",monica
31939," Regular Celery!  Oh, I already have that. ",phoebe
31940, Done! With time-a to spare.,ross
31941, Oooh that may be a New World's record ,chandler
31942," You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called ""a globe?"" Hmm?",ross
31943," Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. ",chandler
31944, What? That's impossible.,ross
31945," 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?",joey
31946," All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!",monica
31947," I am only one man!  Okay Ross, time is up!",chandler
31948," No, just give me another minute.",ross
31949," Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.",chandler
31950," This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.",ross
31951," Okay, but if you can't…no dinner!",chandler
31952, You're on!,ross
31953,"  All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.",joey
31954,"  Hey, did you guys know that your oven doesn't work?",monica
31955," But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?",joey
31956," Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?",monica
31957, Pshhshhh!,ross
31958, Chandler? Can you give me a hand? ,monica
31959," Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.",chandler
31960," Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.",joey
31961, Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.,phoebe
31962," Phoebe, why is your bag moving?",ross
31963," Oh, it's not!",phoebe
31964," Seriously, it's moving!",rachel
31965, What the hell is in there?,joey

31967, Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?,monica
31968, I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.,chandler
31969, That's my pie!,monica
31970, Which smells delicious!,chandler
31971, Uh-oh! Uh-oh!,monica

31997," Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!",monica
31998," Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!",chandler
31999," That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days",phoebe
32000,  Really?,chandler
32001," Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?",monica
32002," Well, it still has to go, right?",chandler
32003," Okay, it's um…",chandler
32004,  Don't do it!,joey

32007, Are you crazy?,phoebe
32008, Are you out of your mind?,ross
32009, Why?,phoebe
32010, Told ya. ,joey
32011," They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.",chandler
32012," Right, they are scary.  Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!",ross
32013," Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?",rachel
32014,  Is there a puppy here?,chandler
32015,"  Okay, you are new!",chandler
32016," Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin’ ice cream.",joey
32017, You don't like ice cream?,phoebe
32018, It's too cold.,ross
32019," Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.",chandler
32020,  It hurts my teeth.,ross
32021," And I don't wanna say this, I don't want you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go.  Oh my god!!",chandler
32022, How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.,ross

32026," Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?",rachel

32028," When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?",rachel
32029," Oh, I'd say about a month.",phoebe
32030, Really? I'd say 3 to 4.,monica
32031, Half hour. ,joey
32032, Interesting.,rachel
32033," When it's your assistant, I would say never.",monica
32034," All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.",joey
32035, Huh. A moo-point?,rachel
32036," Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.",joey
32037,"  Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?",rachel
32038," Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he’s obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.   What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.",monica
32039," You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.",rachel
32040," Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.",joey
32041, Hey!,rachel
32042, How are you holding up?,rachel
32043, Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.,rachel
32044, So were you guys together a long time?,rachel
32045, Now that she broke up with you?,rachel
32046, Yeah. Hmmmm.,rachel

32048," Because, uh—it has to.",rachel
32049," Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.",rachel
32050," Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! ",rachel
32051,"  All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!",joey
32052,"  Street noise drowned any of that out?  No, all right, I see you later, okay... ",joey
32053," Uh, yeah, well, see, he… Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and…you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!",rachel
32054," No?  All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.",rachel
32055," Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.",rachel
32056, What?,rachel
32057," Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?",rachel
32058,"  Wait, we still have time to talk and they’re-they're not even in the car yet!  Oh look, there they go, okay. ",rachel
32059," Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.",monica

32061, Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.,monica
32062," Yeah, okay.",phoebe
32063," Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica!  Oooh, I can't leave her!",monica
32064," You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.",phoebe
32065, That's not gonna work.,monica
32066, I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.,phoebe
32067, Hey! I didn't know either.,monica
32068," Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?",phoebe
32069," Yeah, I knew.",monica
32070, Where's Chandler?,phoebe
32071,  Here I am.,chandler
32072, Wash your hands!!!,phoebe
32073, How did you…know? ,chandler
32074, Hey! What's she doing back here?,ross
32075," Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!",monica
32076," Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...",ross
32077,"  No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.",phoebe
32078," Yeah, but, but look what I'm...",ross
32079," See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. ",phoebe
32080,  Where's Monica?,chandler
32081," Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.",ross
32082, Why not?,chandler
32083, Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.,ross
32084," Well, I, I should go in there.",chandler
32085," No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.",ross
32086, Why not?,chandler
32087, Because you sent away the dog!,ross
32088, This is ridiculous. ,chandler
32089," Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.",ross
32090,"  Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food!  What's the matter?",joey
32091," Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.",chandler
32092," So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.",joey
32093," Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?",chandler
32094," Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.",joey
32095, And that doesn't scare you? ,chandler
32096," Ross, you need some help?",joey
32097," From you?  Yes, please!",ross
32098,"  First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!",joey
32099," I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.",ross
32100, Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.,joey
32101," Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth?  I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you.  Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out",rachel
32102," If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.",joey
32103,"  Hey, is Chandler here?",phoebe
32104," No, no he went for a walk.",chandler
32105," Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look who's back!",phoebe

32108," Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!",phoebe
32109, You think?,joey
32110," Hi, honey.",monica
32111," Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.",chandler
32112," What? Why, why would...",monica
32113,"  Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.",phoebe
32114," Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y’know, for you, and… I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. ",chandler
32115," We have good news, look who's back!",phoebe
32116,  Hi!,rachel
32117, Clunkers?! Oh my god!,chandler
32118," That's right, she came back all by herself.",monica
32119, It's a Thanksgiving miracle!,phoebe
32120,  It is so good to see you!,chandler
32121," Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in… I went too far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?",phoebe
32122," Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.",ross
32123, It's up to you.,chandler
32124," Oh, hi! How are you doing?",rachel
32125, Oh.,rachel
32126," Tag? Y-You're going?  Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?",ross
32127," Ah, what good are you. ",ross
32128," Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.",rachel
32129," Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?",rachel
32130," Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out.",rachel
32131, Really?,rachel
32132," Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.",rachel

32147, I never had a bike of my own.,phoebe
32148,  What?!,ross
32149," Well, we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.",phoebe
32150, That sounds like my first bike.  My dad gave me his old one.,chandler
32151, Ohh.,ross
32152, Did the girl ever let you ride it?,monica
32153, No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front.  So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.,phoebe
32154, That is so unfair!,ross
32155," Not really, I got to drag him around too! ",phoebe
32156, Hey! What are you guys doing?,chandler
32157, Hey.,joey
32158, Making holiday candy for the neighbors.,monica

32165,  Gooood morning!!,rachel
32166," Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!",chandler

32182," Well, you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y’know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate. ",rachel
32183," No, I’ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?",rachel
32184," The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!",monica
32185," Well, either that or uh…",chandler
32186, Joey!!,monica

32221," Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny tushie.",rachel
32222," Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, ""Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision,"" and under Problems with Performance I wrote, ""Dear God, I hope not,"" and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.",rachel
32223," Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.",monica
32224, Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!,joey

32240,  What happened? I’m just eating candy.,chandler
32241," Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know, maybe they didn’t take it the way I meant it.",rachel
32242," Absolutely! Y’know, because tushie can mean both ass and good worker.",chandler
32243," Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!",rachel
32244, Hey Rach?,joey

32256,"  All right, I’ll do it just this once! But you can’t tell anybody!",monica
32257,  It’s unbelievable! I-I can’t believe that sign didn’t work!,monica

32268," Phoebe, you can’t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!",ross
32269, Why? Why do I have to learn?,phoebe

32367, And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.,phoebe
32368, You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.,rachel

32395," Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.",monica
32396," Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word.  Kind of what ‘probably’ really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" y’know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!"" Y’know? You gotta take care of yourselves!  In this world history teaches us nothing! ",phoebe

32406,  You need to give him money.,monica
32407, Give him money? It was a joke!,chandler

32410, You've got to be smooth about it.,monica

32419," Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.",ross
32420,"  Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh  Draydl, draydl, draydl, I made you out of clay.",ross
32421,"  Okay, it's not a contest.",ross
32422," Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?",ross
32423," No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.",ross

32442, Here.  Now I only owe you $49.50.,joey
32443, Hey Pheebs!,chandler
32444, Hey! ,phoebe
32445," If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?",chandler
32446," It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!"" I mean, it is so annoying.",monica
32447," Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",phoebe
32448," Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?",monica
32449, Maybe on some level.,phoebe
32450," Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.",rachel
32451, What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?,joey
32452,"  Hey, Joey, I got you another present. ",phoebe
32453," Oh wait, before you tell me what it is!  Okay, what is it?",joey
32454," It's a…tarantula!  Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?",phoebe
32455," What are you talking about? I love them!  Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?",rachel
32456," Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! ",joey
32457," Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.",rachel
32458,"  Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. ",phoebe
32459," What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?",rachel
32460, Our apartment is ready.,phoebe
32461, And that makes you angry because…,rachel
32462, Because you would rather live here with Joey.,phoebe
32463, Where did you get that?,rachel
32464, Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.,phoebe
32465, Phoebe?,rachel
32466, Hm?,phoebe
32467," Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!",rachel
32468,  Fish!,phoebe
32469," It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.",rachel
32470," Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here…",phoebe
32471," Oh, it's so much more fun with you.",rachel
32472," We did have fun, didn't we?",phoebe
32473, We did!,rachel
32474," Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.",phoebe
32475," Oh, I would love to!",rachel
32476," Yay, okay!",phoebe
32477," Good, good, good, good, good. ",rachel
32478," Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",phoebe
32479,  Um...  Done!,rachel
32480, Hey!,ross
32481," No, these are my pants.",ross
32482," Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?",ross
32483," Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I…uh, you gotta have something.",ross
32484, I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!,ross
32485," What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?",monica
32486,  Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.,ross
32487," Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from…Texas.",monica
32488," That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben.  Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.",ross
32489," You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!",ross
32490,"  You are? Me, too!",ross
32491, Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?,monica
32492,"  You wanna wander in the hall?  Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?",ross
32493, Yeah!,ross
32494, Come on Ben.,monica
32495, Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...,ross
32496,"  Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!",chandler
32497, Hey! ,chandler
32498," What are you doing here, Santa?",ross
32499," Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird…turtle-man?",chandler
32500," I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?",ross
32501, What?,chandler
32502," You bet I did, Ben, put it there!   Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small!  Ho, ho, ho!",chandler
32503," Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.",monica
32504,  What are you doing?,ross
32505," You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!",chandler
32506," Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.",ross
32507, Why?,chandler
32508," Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you’re wrecking it.",ross
32509, But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.,chandler
32510," I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.",ross
32511," Fine, I'll give the suit back.",chandler
32512,"  Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? ",monica
32513, Santa? Really?,chandler
32514," Yes, is that okay?",monica
32515, Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?,chandler
32516, No.,monica
32517, Then it's okay! ,chandler
32518," Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!",ross
32519," Because, if Santa and the Holiday…Armadillo?  ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!",chandler
32520," Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.",ross
32521," Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?",chandler
32522," All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.",ross
32523,  Merry Christmas!,joey
32524, Oh wow! Look at this place!,rachel
32525," Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh! New sconces!",phoebe
32526,  Oh my God!,rachel

32528,"  Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?",rachel
32529, Yeah?,phoebe
32530, And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?,rachel
32531, Yeah?,phoebe
32532, Do you really not know where I’m going with this?  It left! It’s one huge room!,rachel
32533, Oh no!   Oh! Wow!!!,phoebe
32534, See?,rachel
32535," Well, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up.",phoebe
32536," You can’t, because of the new skylight!",rachel
32537, There’s a skylight?!  Wow!!,phoebe
32538, So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?,rachel
32539,"  Y’know I’m-I’m sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.",phoebe
32540, Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?,rachel
32541," A little bit, yeah.",phoebe
32542, Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?,rachel
32543, You heard her too?! You have the gift!,phoebe
32544," Phoebe, it’s okay. I like living with Joey.",rachel
32545, Are you sure?,phoebe
32546," Oh please, I hate packing, it’s closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I’m really gonna miss living with you.",rachel
32547, Oh me too.,phoebe
32548," I know.  Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?",rachel
32549," No, I do not hear that.",phoebe
32550," …and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day, burned for…",ross
32551," That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.",ross
32552, Yeah?,ross
32553, My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. ,chandler
32554," The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles! ",ross
32555,  Hey!,rachel
32556, Oh.,phoebe
32557,  Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny’s funeral in here.,rachel
32558," Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!",ross
32559, Oh.,rachel
32560, Oh.,phoebe

32562, I got it!,rachel
32563,  Is it back in the cage?,joey
32564, Its back in cage!,rachel
32565, Cage closed?,joey

32569," Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.",chandler
32570," Oh, y’know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I——Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? ",rachel
32571,  It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.,chandler
32572," Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.  Thief.",rachel
32573, I—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.,chandler
32574," Why, why not?",rachel
32575, Because it's too delicious.,chandler
32576," Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.",rachel
32577," No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate,  Momma’s Little Bakery.  I feel terrible, I’m a horrible, horrible, horrible person.",chandler
32578,"  Oh, I’m sorry, what?",rachel
32579," All right, I should get going, big day at work. Y’know I’m in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead.",joey

32640," Oh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as a sign of protest.",ross

32664, But we should take it.,chandler
32665, But we should move quick.,rachel

32947, So what do you want me to do?,ross
32948," Well, just shimmy down me and drop!",joey
32949, Hi.,ross
32950, Hi.,joey

32977, As in Rosita does not move.,joey
32978," Joey, it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?",rachel
32979, The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of off Stevie.,joey
32980, Stevie the TV?,rachel
32981,  Is there a problem?,joey
32982," No!  Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together!  You bitch!",rachel
32983," Hey, y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, ""This is my brother-in-law Ross."" Not, ""My friend Ross,"" ""brother-in-law Ross."" That’s weird isn’t it?",ross
32984," Couldn’t I just say, ""This is Ross?""",chandler
32985,"  Sure, do whatever you want.",ross
32986,"  Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section…",monica

32993, I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the window in the attic!,phoebe
32994,"  Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!  Yes we’re surprised!  Who did you leave a message with?",ross
32995,  Sorry! ,chandler
32996," Joey, Joey I am so sorry.",rachel
32997," I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?",joey

32999,  She’s not even cold yet!,joey

33001, That’s true.,joey
33002,  Okay? You ready?,rachel
33003," Yeah, I…  I don’t want Stevie to see her like this.",joey
33004," I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room.",ross
33005," Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it’s time the velvet ropes came down.",monica
33006, They kept your room for a while.,ross
33007," Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria’s Secret catalogues, not a gym!",monica
33008," Come on, you know they love you.",ross
33009, As much as they love you?,monica
33010, I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my fault.,ross
33011,  Hey.,phoebe

33013, Hey!,monica
33014," Ugh, I hate this year!",phoebe
33015, What’s wrong with this year?,ross
33016," Well okay, it’s already February and I’ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!",phoebe
33017, That was me and Ross.,monica
33018, Oh that’s right!,phoebe
33019," Hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.",ross
33020, Oh that’s a great idea. You’re really good on the phone.,monica
33021," Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y’know, I probably wouldn’t have to say spank as much. ",phoebe
33022, What?,ross
33023," Oh yeah, like you never called!",phoebe
33024," Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.",phoebe

33037, I used to love to play restaurant.,monica
33038," Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.",ross
33039," Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies! ",monica
33040," Wow! Great!  Wait, dad who-who’s cigarettes are these?",ross
33041," Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad,  Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym… Oooh, my rock polisher!",ross

33049, May I ask why?,phoebe
33050, I surely do!,phoebe
33051,"  Umm, is-is that because you’re out of toner?",phoebe
33052, No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.,phoebe
33053," Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?",phoebe

33064, Francette? What is she? A couch?,joey
33065, Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.,joey
33066," Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y’know, start the heeling process?",rachel
33067," Well, I guess you’re right. Maybe, maybe I’ll take her down to the incinerator. It’s gonna be so said, and kinda cool.  She’s heeled!",joey
33068, That’s weird.,rachel
33069," No it’s not weird, it’s a miracle!",joey
33070, It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s some explanation.,rachel
33071," Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!",joey
33072," Joey, I really don’t…",rachel
33073,  Can you tell me how this happened?,joey
33074, Well no.,rachel
33075, Miracle!,joey
33076," No, y’know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!",rachel
33077, Someone like an…angel?,joey
33078," That’s right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. ",rachel
33079,  Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! ,joey
33080," Dad that won’t matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.",ross
33081," Well, can you blame her?",ross
33082," Dad, dad I don’t want to hear about it.",ross
33083," Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we’re gonna give her some! Okay, grab…grab some empty boxes. Okay? We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in their.",ross

33094,  My chair heels itself.,joey
33095," Earl, you’re not hearing me! All I’m saying is that you’re not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with! ",phoebe
33096," Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.",phoebe
33097," All right so Earl, let’s just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?",phoebe
33098," Oh sorry, boyfriend!",phoebe

33113," Wow! Look at this!  I can’t believe I even fit into this shirt!   Oh, this is yours. ",monica
33114," Oh, I don’t know how that got in there.",ross

33120, So why-why wasn’t Ross’s stuff ruined?  And if you say the words medical marvel I’m going to Easy Bake your head!,monica
33121," So wait, Ross’s stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!",monica
33122, I can’t believe this! ,monica
33123, Hey Chandler!,rachel

33125," How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?",rachel
33126," Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore.",chandler
33127," Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?",rachel
33128,  Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?,chandler
33129, I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000. ,rachel
33130, That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!,chandler
33131," Well, it’s a long story, but umm I broke Joey’s chair…",rachel
33132, Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair?,chandler
33133, Yeah.,rachel
33134, I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replaced it with mine!,chandler

33148, I think I should get the chair!,chandler
33149, How do you figure?,joey
33150," Because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair, is me!",chandler
33151, No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere.,rachel
33152," Well, where’s the logic in that?!",chandler
33153," The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!",rachel
33154, So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!,chandler
33155, That’s right!,joey
33156, What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!,chandler

33164," No! Think about it okay? This isn’t even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you’re my first call! And-and somebody else might’ve hung up on you, but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.",phoebe
33165, Yes.,phoebe
33166, I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see that this-this…this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.,phoebe

33173," But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!",phoebe
33174," Y’know, I don’t-I don’t think it’s you. This is a freaky place.  Hey! Guys!   Oh no, it’s you.",phoebe
33175," Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this.  It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don’t even know what it is! Ohh, it’s still soft.  What do you think this is?",monica

33217," Yeah, but you shouldn’t compare yourself to me.",phoebe
33218, There you go!,rachel
33219," I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That’s it!! That’s everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!!  And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean. ",phoebe

33224," How hot do I look in this, huh?!",ross
33225," Ross, a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?",chandler
33226, That’s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.,ross
33227," Hey, what’s the horsepower on this thing?",joey
33228,"  I don’t know, but-but look how shiny!",ross
33229, I can’t believe you bought this.,monica

33244,"  Okay, for the last time. It’s not named for each individual man.",chandler
33245," Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can’t believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter!  And you! I can’t believe that you would have a tux that’s thirty years old! ",chandler

33300, What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed!,rachel
33301, Monica’s wasted.,chandler
33302, Maybe that will liven up this party.,ross
33303,"  Okay, will you just go help her change please!",chandler
33304," Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.",rachel
33305, Yep. ,joey
33306, Ahh!,rachel
33307,  A scooter! ,rachel
33308,  Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.,ross

33314," Okay.  Happy birthday Grandma! It’s better to be over the hill  then buried under it.  All our love Monica and Chandler.  That’s funny, yeah!",rachel
33315, No-no-no-no! That was the joke!,chandler
33316,"  No, I know! I get it! It’s funny!",rachel
33317," No, because you’re not a grandmother!",chandler
33318," No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things. That’s why it’s so funny. ",rachel
33319, All you had to do was buy the card!,monica
33320, Hey! Look who’s back! It’s the birthday girl! How’s the birthday girl feeling?,ross
33321," Well, I feel fine, but I think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids.",rachel
33322, What? ,ross
33323, Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids…,rachel
33324," Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.",phoebe
33325, As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!,rachel
33326," If you could do that, I’d marry the hippity-hop.",phoebe
33327," So, if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35, I don’t have to get pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant…",rachel
33328," Really! That long?!   Look all you want, it’s happening!",monica
33329," No, so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’s three years, that’s three whole years—Oh, wait a minute though. I’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I’d like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I’m thirty.",rachel
33330, Which is fine! Because you just turned——twenty-eight!,ross
33331," No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!",rachel
33332, Will you quit hoggin’ it!,joey
33333,  I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.,rachel
33334,  You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I’m a little drunk.,ross
33335,  Oh that’s great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please?  There we go.,chandler
33336,  Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?,joey
33337,  How are you feeling?,chandler
33338," You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now! ",monica
33339, I really wish that you wouldn’t.,ross
33340,"  Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don’t talk to anyone.",chandler
33341,  Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from the birthday girl! Huh?,phoebe
33342, Pheebs!!,chandler
33343, Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!,phoebe
33344, Come on!,ross
33345, I think it’s necessary. ,chandler
33346, I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends…,monica
33347,  Wooo!! Hoo!!,phoebe
33348," I really like to say that I’m-um…  Y’know what I’d really like to say? I’m drunk!!  That’s right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!!  And guess what! I’ve been drunk before! And I’ve smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It’s all okay. It’s okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up. ",monica
33349,"  Okay quick, help me get this off! ",phoebe
33350, Yeah!!,joey
33351, I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair!,phoebe
33352," Oh, I don’t know Pheebs. It’ll be okay.",joey
33353," Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?",phoebe
33354, That’s not gonna happen. No.  Because we have a new deal!,joey
33355," Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!",phoebe
33356, Like what?,joey
33357," Like okay I-I-I, I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I, I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!",phoebe
33358," Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?",monica
33359," No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks. ",phoebe
33360," Hey.  Oh, poor Pheebs.",rachel
33361," Hey, y’know what you guys? I think I’m gonna go walk her home. ",joey

33365," Pheebs! Wait up!  Listen uh, close your eyes.  Maybe that’s one thing you can cross off your list.",joey
33366, Oh yeah.,phoebe
33367," Oh, and plus I’m 1/16th Portuguese.",joey

33369," Okay, is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick it up…and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We’re gonna lift the car…and slide it out. Lift and slide!",ross

33421," So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and…",joey
33422, What is DOOL?,monica
33423," Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you’re not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!",joey
33424, That’s great!,chandler
33425," And-and-and not only that, I’m gettin’ a new brain!!",joey
33426, So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!,chandler
33427," Wait, what do you mean you’re getting a new brain?",rachel

33429, What? A brain transplant?!,ross
33430,"  Yes, it’s a highly controversial procedure.",joey
33431, It’s ridiculous!,ross
33432," Well, I think it’s ridiculous that you haven’t had s*x in three and a half months.",joey
33433,"  It’s winter, they are fewer people on the street. ",ross
33434, Who are they killing off?,monica
33435," Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.",joey
33436, She’s my favorite character on DOOL.,monica

33438," She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, I mean I don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage.",rachel
33439, And the way she slaps all the time!,monica
33440, Oh!,rachel
33441, Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?! ,monica
33442, Don’t do it.,chandler
33443," Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.",rachel

33445," Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the ""brain transplant,"" you are going to be her?",ross
33446," Yes, but in Drake Ramoray’s body.  Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!",joey
33447,"  Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?",phoebe
33448,"  Well, I'd have to say gay.",rachel
33449, Yeah? Why?,phoebe
33450, Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.,rachel
33451, Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. ,phoebe
33452, Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.,rachel
33453,  Ohh knockers will help us figure it out. ,phoebe
33454," All right, straight, and not subtle. ",rachel
33455," Ohh, he left his cell phone.",phoebe
33456," Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.",rachel
33457, Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.,phoebe
33458," What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fall in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.",rachel
33459, Yeah… That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. ,phoebe
33460, What? Wait! Why…why do you get the story?,rachel
33461, I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.,phoebe
33462," Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.",rachel
33463," That wasn’t a date! That was, that was just friends getting together… having s*x.",phoebe
33464," Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.",rachel
33465, No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.,phoebe
33466," Yeah!  And until now, I didn’t think I’d love again.",rachel
33467, Nice try.,phoebe
33468, Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?,rachel
33469, I don’t know.,phoebe
33470," Well umm, maybe we could uhh…  Ah-ha! Too slow!!",rachel
33471, Ah-ha! Too cocky!,phoebe
33472, That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?,joey
33473," Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.",joey
33474, Say what?,joey
33475," No. No, I’m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I’m the guy in the coma!",joey
33476," An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me…",joey
33477,  I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?,joey
33478," Oh uh, one of the writers.",joey
33479, Umm…,joey
33480, Okay.,joey
33481, Ms. Monroe…  Oh there you go. ,joey
33482," No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.",rachel
33483," Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.",phoebe
33484, I don’t think so.,rachel
33485,"  Fine all right, but I’d bet you’d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.",phoebe
33486,"  All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.",rachel
33487," Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.",phoebe
33488," Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.",rachel
33489, Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.,phoebe
33490, Yes okay.  Well now see this isn’t telling us anything.  Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat’s a steak house!,rachel
33491," Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that’s one for you.",phoebe
33492,"  Oh, I win! He’s got Barney’s on his speed dial.",rachel
33493," So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. Who has Barney’s the store on their speed dial?",phoebe
33494,  His new girlfriend!,rachel
33495, What is that?,monica
33496, I think it’s the dying cat parade.,chandler
33497, It sounds like it’s coming from across the street.,monica
33498,  Oh my God!,chandler
33499, What?,monica
33500," Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, ""You’re half Scottish right?""",chandler
33501, Nooo!!,monica

33503," No, there is no way! It can not be Ross!  Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!",monica
33504, Why is your family Ross?!,chandler
33505," He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It’s not even a song!",monica
33506," If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.",chandler
33507, Hi Pheebs!,rachel
33508, Hi!,phoebe
33509, How are ya?,rachel
33510, Good.,phoebe

33513, And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?,rachel
33514, Yeah!,phoebe
33515, And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!,rachel
33516," Ooh, now you lost me.",phoebe
33517, You stole the phone!,rachel

34149,"  Yeah. So uh Ross, well now—why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?",joey

34249, You sound like a guy.,phoebe
34250," No, a guy would be saying, ""I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."" Oh my God! I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I’d be giving up! I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again.",monica

34321, You gotta help me out here Pheebs.,monica
34322," All right, I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.",phoebe
34323, So I’m not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with?,monica

34410, That’s what you say about p0rn.,monica
34411, You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back.,joey

34413, Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender.,joey
34414," Plus, everyone’s gonna see your thing. ",monica

34447," The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!",monica
34448, That’s me! Come on!,chandler
34449," Okay.  But wait, we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to have lunch.",monica
34450," Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.",chandler
34451, Shrill?! The wedding is back on!,monica
34452,  Hi! Nice to meet you!,chandler

34455, I’ll be right with you.,chandler
34456,  Cassie needs to stay at your place.,monica

34459," What?! Chandler, she’s our cousin!",ross
34460, I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch.  Say something.,chandler
34461, You were staring about eight inches south of there.,monica
34462," Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.",ross

34469, And scene! Huh? Wasn’t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?,joey
34470, Wow! Sure! That’s great!,joey
34471," Yeah! Yeah sure, just so long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.",joey
34472, So…What?,joey
34473, Yes!,joey
34474, No. What?,joey
34475, Barmitsvahed?,joey

34480, But you told them you weren’t?,monica
34481, That’s right.,joey
34482, Wow! Wow! And it’s definitely all gone? There’s nothing there to work with?  What were you thinking?,monica
34483," I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.",joey
34484, Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to…grow a turtleneck!,monica
34485, I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.,joey
34486," Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!",monica
34487, I just have to call my agent and tell her I can’t do the part. ,joey
34488, Unless!,monica
34489, Unless what?,joey
34490," Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.",monica
34491, Like what?,joey
34492," Well I’m not sure yet, but umm, off the top of my head I’m thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.",monica
34493," Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone.",phoebe
34494," Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list.",rachel

34502, Are you makin’ him a sandwich?,rachel
34503," No it’s umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I’m gonna go guys.",monica
34504, I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present! ,monica
34505,  We have to get her a present?!,rachel

34519,  Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related.,ross
34520," Well I’m, I’m a little slow.  Just as our children would be.",ross

34539," Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap.  Umm, this one is made of bologna. ",monica
34540, And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?,joey
34541," Oh, just until the glue dries.",monica
34542, Thank God!,joey
34543,"  Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.",monica
34544, Ah.,joey

34546, Well maybe we just take that one away. ,joey
34547," I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that’s really just for me.  Okay. So, why don’t you go into your room and try these on and we’ll see—get a better idea of what’s gonna work.",monica

34560,"  She’s your cousin. She’s your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she’d think you were sick!  Or would she? Let’s back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan’s Run, the sexiest movie ever.  Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I’m going in.",ross
34561,"  Say something clever!  Okay, doesn’t have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words.  Any words will do.  Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever!  There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!!   I-I, I uh haven’t had s*x in a very long time.   Yeah, you really shouldn’t have said anything.",ross

34724," Look Mon, if you could just call my mom…",joey
34725, Oh Joey!,monica

34728, Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?,joey
34729," Well, what am I going to say?",monica
34730," I don’t know. Just uh, just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or—No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don’t think you can blame it on them, so… ",joey
34731,"  Hello?  Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani?  Hi, this is Monica Geller.  Yeah I’m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding.

34838," ...everyone, this is Chandler!",ross
34839,  Okay.,chandler

34842, Ennnh.,monica
34843," Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!",monica

34849," Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. ",rachel
34850," All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4,  2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…! ",monica

34887, Then all your stuff would be here.,monica
34888," Well, what if all my stuff was here?",chandler

34890, Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?,chandler
34891, You wanted it to be a surprise.,monica
34892, Oh my God.,chandler

34894," Okay!  Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God, I thought…  Wait a minute, I-I can do this.  I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.  And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  Monica, will you marry me?",chandler

35140," Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…",monica
35141," No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedos—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. He was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!",chandler

35160, I’m wearing his briefs right now.,phoebe
35161, That’s…kinda hot.,joey
35162, I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.,phoebe
35163," Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that.",joey

35166, There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.,phoebe
35167," Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.",joey
35168, I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever do that.,phoebe
35169, Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.,joey
35170," Okay, whatever.",phoebe
35171," You’ve seen my huge stack of p0rn, right? ",joey

35483," Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.",phoebe
35484, Anything?,rachel
35485," No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn’t heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler’s parents again!",ross
35486, You told them he was missing?,phoebe
35487," No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I’m interested in them.",ross
35488," All right, we’ve got to tell her he’s gone. ",rachel
35489, No! Hey! Hey! We can’t!,ross
35490," Ross, she’s gonna start getting ready soon!",rachel

35506," Hey! Okay, so I thought we’d start with my make up and then do my hair.",monica
35507," Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.",rachel
35508, About what?,monica
35509, Umm… I’m never gonna getting married!,rachel
35510," Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?",monica
35511," No Monica! I’m serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.",rachel
35512, Any woman would be lucky to have ya.,monica
35513, Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.,rachel
35514,  Rachel! You okay?,monica
35515," Excuse me, Aaron?  Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn’t supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It’s my best friend’s, and I’m officiating so I really can’t work past four.",joey
35516, I’m having surgery!,joey
35517," Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn’t want you to worry about me. But, I’m having surgery today.",joey
35518, Transplant.,joey
35519, Hair transplant.,joey

35526," That is an old, Chinese woman!",ross
35527," He could be in disguise, y’know.",phoebe
35528," Aw, y’know…Y’know, maybe we’re-we’re just approaching this all wrong. If you’re Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you’d go?",ross
35529, So this is your office?,ross
35530, How did you guys find me? I knew I should’ve hid at the gym!,chandler
35531, What the hell are you doing?!,phoebe
35532, Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I’m related to Monica. How is she?,chandler
35533," She’s fine. She doesn’t know you’re gone. And she doesn’t have to know, okay? Now come on, we’re going home.",ross
35534, No! No! No! I can’t do that!,chandler
35535, Why not?!,phoebe
35536," Because if I go home, we’re gonna become the Bings! I can’t be the Bings!",chandler
35537, What’s wrong with being the Bings?,ross
35538, The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!,chandler
35539," Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?",ross
35540, No.,chandler
35541, Then you are neither of your parents!,ross
35542," It’s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don’t race cars! I don’t make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.",chandler
35543," But look Chandler, right now no-one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.",phoebe
35544," I want to. I love her so much, but I’m afr…It’s too huge.",chandler
35545," Y’know, okay. You’re right. It is huge. So why don’t we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?",ross
35546," Well yeah, but then…",chandler
35547,"  Yeah—No-but-but-but-but! We’re just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that’s not scary right?",ross
35548, Depends on what you mean by we.,chandler
35549, The nights are the hardest.  But then the day comes! And that’s every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again…,rachel

Well, let’s get started before the groom takes off again. Huh?  We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I’ve known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I’ve left my notes in my dressing room, we shall proceed to the vows. Monica?",joey
35667,  He took off?,monica
35668, Go on! Go on. ,rachel
35669," Chandler, for so long I…I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And instead, I found everything that I’d ever been looking for my whole life. And now…here we are…with our future before us…and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don’t want to. You go!",monica
35670, Chandler?,joey
35671,"  No, that’s okay.  Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way, it’s okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I’m sure? ",chandler
35672," You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in me by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?",joey
35673, I do.,chandler
35674, I do.,monica
35675, Yeah you do!,joey
35676, Rings?,ross

35704, What?! What are you talking about?,chandler
35705, What are you talking about?,monica

36750, I think it’s best sir.,chandler
36751," Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em.",chandler
36752, What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!,chandler

36757," Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today.",phoebe
36758, Why not?!,monica
36759, Because I’m dumping him today.,phoebe
36760, What?! You said he was sweet!,monica
36761," He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time.  ""So did-did you get home from work okay?"" ""Did-did you get out of the shower okay?""",phoebe
36762, Just don’t pick up your phone.,monica
36763," Then he comes over!  ""I’m so worried about you."" Uck! Be a man!",phoebe
36764, What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?,monica
36765," You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.",phoebe

36767," Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself!",phoebe
36768," Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it!",monica
36769, Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.,phoebe
36770, What do you mean?,monica
36771," Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch!",phoebe
36772, I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.,monica

36774," Sure, what’s up?",chandler
36775," Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. ""Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon,"" or ""I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?""",rachel
36776,  Hey!,ross

36794," Joey, I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this  actor taking them?",ross
36795, Hey! I’m an  actor too! I’m not sure. I think they’re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.,joey
36796, A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!,ross
36797, Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?,joey
36798, Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!!,ross

36815, And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?,joey
36816," Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no.",ross
36817, Dude! What is going on?!,joey
36818, I just…I have to find out how it went.,ross
36819, Why?,joey
36820, This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!,ross
36821, They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you!,joey
36822, I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!,ross
36823," Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?",joey
36824, I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening.,ross
36825, What do you mean?,joey
36826," It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section.",ross
36827, That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!,joey
36828, No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.,ross
36829," Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?",joey
36830, It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though.,ross
36831," Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel.",joey
36832, No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?,ross
36833," I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants.",joey
36834," No, it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now.",ross
36835," That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?",joey
36836, Yeah.,ross
36837," Hey, I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!",joey

37142, So apparently I’m available for lunch.,ross
37143, I can’t. I’m busy. I’m apartment hunting.,rachel
37144, You’re moving?,ross
37145," Yeah, I can’t live with Joey once the baby comes. I don’t want my child’s first words to be,  ""How you doin’?""",rachel
37146, So does-does Joey know you’re moving?,ross
37147," Well, I haven’t discussed it with him yet, but I know he’s gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.",rachel
37148, That’s not really p0rn.,ross
37149, Not so much.,rachel
37150," Hey, y’know what and if you’re looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.",ross
37151, Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?,rachel
37152," Well I don’t know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want.  With your permission.",ross
37153, Yeah that would really be great.,rachel
37154, Yeah.,ross
37155, Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn’t. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.,rachel
37156, Yeah. No. No you’re right.,ross
37157, Shall we?,rachel
37158, Yeah.,ross
37159, Hi. I’m Ross Geller. I live in the building.,ross
37160," And I’m Rachel, an admirer of the building.",rachel
37161, I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I’m so sorry for your loss.,ross
37162, What?,ross
37163," Oh, thank God!",ross
37164, Ahh.,rachel
37165," Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in  the laundry room. ",ross
37166, Y’know I would it’s just painful.,ross
37167, So she’s really not dead.,rachel
37168," Hmm. Do you think—Could you tell me if she’s hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?",rachel
37169," Oh well umm, I make it myself! It’s two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is…y’know what? We just met.",monica
37170,  I love her.,monica
37171, Okay. ,monica
37172, See? I told you.,chandler
37173, She stole my jeans!,monica
37174,  What?,chandler
37175, I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!,monica
37176, So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?,chandler
37177, Don’t you see? It’s the perfect crime!,monica
37178, She must’ve been planning this for years!,chandler
37179, I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!,monica
37180," Honey, isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?",chandler
37181, I guess.,monica
37182," So, shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?",chandler
37183, Fine. I’m just glad I didn’t give her my secret ingredient.,monica
37184," Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?",chandler
37185, Yeah! ,monica
37186, Hi!,phoebe
37187," Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.",phoebe
37188, Oh.,phoebe
37189, Yeah.  Yeah.,phoebe
37190, Maybe this is too weird.,phoebe
37191, No don’t tear out your eyes!!,phoebe
37192," Oh, yeah try that.  So, is that better?",phoebe
37193," Look Eric, turn around.  Look, I like you, but it shouldn’t be this hard. Y’know? This is our first date y’know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ‘Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?’ and y’know first kisses and……second kisses. ",phoebe
37194," Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter. ",ross
37195," Yeah, we’re done.",ross
37196, Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? ,ross
37197,"  Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?",joey

37200, Sweet!,ross
37201," All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.",joey
37202, Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,ross
37203," To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you’re not gonna be on TV!",joey
37204," No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.",ross
37205," Oh, you’re switching apartments?",joey
37206," It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.",ross
37207, But Rachel has an apartment.,joey
37208," Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.",ross
37209, She is?,joey
37210," Yeah, you didn’t expect her to live there with a baby did you?",ross
37211, I guess I didn’t really think about it.,joey
37212,  Ezel!  Hey Gunther! You’re an ezel!,ross
37213, Damnit!,ross
37214, Nice jeans!,monica
37215, Oh.   You’re not gettin’ it.,monica

37217," Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That’ll really work up your appetite for lunch.",monica
37218, Hello.,monica
37219," I’m sorry. I’ve never had a maid before, is this not okay?",monica
37220, Hey!,rachel
37221, Hey!,joey
37222, How was the game?,rachel
37223," Oh, okay. I…I ate way too much.",joey
37224, Oh.,rachel
37225," Ooh.  So umm, I was talkin’ to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.",joey
37226, Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.,rachel
37227, I was kinda hoping you’d stay.,joey
37228," Oh but Joey, I have to go. There’s no room for a baby here.",rachel
37229," No room? It’s a baby. It’s like this big.  Y’know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here.  Or-or-or we could put it right here.  Aw, it’s cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here.  You wouldn’t even notice it. Where’s the baby? ",joey
37230," Honey, it’s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there’s a screaming baby around.",rachel
37231, I could use a challenge! It’s getting pretty easy.,joey
37232," Honey, it’s so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can’t do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.",rachel
37233, I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn’t have to change.,joey
37234, I know.,rachel
37235, Y’know I blame Ross for this.,joey
37236, I do too a little bit.,rachel
37237," I’m gonna miss you, you’re the hottest roommate I ever had.",joey
37238," Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.",phoebe
37239," No, I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later.",phoebe
37240, Really? That’s the thing I’m worse at! You’ll see. ,phoebe
37241,  Hi!,chandler
37242," Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.",monica
37243, How come?,chandler
37244, Because I put my head between her legs.,monica
37245, To see her pants?,chandler
37246, They’re my pants!,monica
37247, Are you sure? Did you see the stain?,chandler
37248, No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.,monica
37249," God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?",chandler
37250, Fine.  She’s wearing my bra!,monica
37251, Oh dear God!,chandler
37252, My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!,monica
37253, And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.,chandler
37254, Here’s the plan! Okay? I’m going to leave you get a look at Brenda’s bra!,monica
37255, Here’s another plan…No!,chandler
37256, I would do it but she thinks I’m attracted to her!,monica
37257, Why?,chandler
37258, Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we’re a team! We’re in this together!,monica
37259, I fear a jury will see it the same way!,chandler
37260," Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman’s breasts all the time!",monica
37261, You see that?,chandler
37262, Do you see this? ,monica
37263, All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!,chandler
37264," Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you’ll know it’s mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there’s a very noticeable rip.",monica
37265, You need new clothes.,chandler
37266, Hi. How is she?,ross
37267,"  Oh.  Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen. ",ross
37268, Oh I don’t know that it would.,ross
37269, All right then. ,ross
37270,  Hey!,phoebe
37271, Hey!  Can we pick up where we left off?,phoebe
37272, Why?,phoebe

37275,  Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!,phoebe
37276, You-you…you had s*x with Ursula?!,phoebe
37277, You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!,phoebe
37278, Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird.,phoebe
37279, So I guess this is it.,phoebe
37280," Yeah, so do you.",phoebe
37281, I’m leaning. This is where I lean.,chandler
37282, Brenda a bee!,chandler
37283, Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!,chandler
37284, You do?,chandler
37285, I totally understand.  Can I just see your bra?,chandler
37286, Hi!,rachel
37287,  Where did you get those jeans?!,monica
37288, You gave them to me!,rachel
37289, No I didn’t!,monica
37290," All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.",rachel
37291, Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!,monica
37292, What bra?,rachel
37293, The pink one with the flowers?!,monica
37294, You mean the one that you’re wearing? ,rachel
37295, Sounds about right.,monica
37296, What is this?,rachel
37297," Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here,  so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh—Oh look! Here’s a baby monitor , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?",joey
37298, You’re so sweet.  Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy! ,rachel
37299, Ahhhhhhhhhhhh…. That-that-that’s really just to show where the baby would go. Y’know why don’t I hold on to him so that there’s no confusion? ,joey
37300," But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it’s going to be loud.",rachel
37301, I’m loud!,joey
37302, It’s gonna be up all night!,rachel
37303, I’m up all night!,joey
37304, It’s gonna poop!,rachel
37305, Hello!,joey
37306, What about all the women you want to bring home?,rachel
37307," Look, if I’m bringing home a woman who can’t stand being around a baby, then maybe I don’t want to be with that woman! Or maybe we’ll just do it in the bathroom of the club!",joey
37308," Joey, are you sure?",rachel
37309," Yeah! All right—Look, I know sometimes it’ll be hard, okay? But, it’ll also be really…really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.",joey
37310, I want me to stay too.,rachel
37311, Ohh!,joey
37312, Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! It’s so cute!,rachel
37313, I know! I found it on the street.,joey
37314, Are you serious—Really?! It’s in such good condition.,rachel
37315, Yeah.,joey
37316, Wow! Whoa-whoa what’s under the covers?,rachel
37317, I don’t know.,joey
37318, It’s moving.,rachel

37331," Okay so, we’ll just come up with some kind of signal if it’s going well you can take off.",phoebe
37332, No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven’t told him I’m pregnant yet.,rachel
37333, Oh. Why not?,phoebe
37334, ‘Cause I know he’s gonna flip out and I hate it when he’s angry.,rachel
37335," Oh Rachel, this is all so ‘Papa don’t preach.’",phoebe
37336, What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he’d make me eat the entire pack.,rachel
37337," Wow! Oh well, I will be there!",phoebe
37338, Thank you.,rachel
37339, Gosh. I’m not gonna let that man make you eat your baby.  Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.,phoebe
37340,  No you don’t!,monica

37344, Your secret bachelorette party…,phoebe
37345, You had a bachelorette party?!,chandler
37346, She untied his G-string with her teeth.  Somebody stop me!,phoebe
37347," I thought we weren’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.",chandler
37348, It’s a grand tradition!,joey
37349," I’m sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!",monica
37350, Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.,rachel
37351," This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn’t allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!",joey
37352, You went home with the waitress.,chandler
37353," Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.",joey
37354, I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!,chandler

37356," Oh, I-I don’t eat meat.",phoebe
37357," Yeah, I don’t eat that either.",phoebe
37358, Well actually umm…,rachel
37359,"  In case you didn’t notice, that is a scary man.",rachel
37360," He’s right though, the ’74 is absolute piss.",phoebe
37361," This was such a huge mistake. I can’t tell him Phoebe. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t…",rachel
37362, Rachel!,phoebe
37363," No it’s okay, this is what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.",rachel
37364," Why, so he can get mad at the baby?",phoebe
37365," Hey, that is the…baby’s problem.  Oh, everything okay with the waiter?",rachel
37366," Well… Umm, I got TiVo.",rachel
37367, It’s slang for pregnant.,phoebe

37383, She’s okay with Rachel and the baby?,chandler
37384," Well I…I haven’t actually told her yet. I don’t want to scare her off, y’know?",ross
37385," Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you’re going down the same path, but you’re really going down different ones.",chandler
37386, I’m gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.,joey
37387,"  Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you’re gonna have a bachelor party.",monica
37388, What?,chandler

37392," Come on! Come on, it’ll be fun! It’ll make me feel so much better.",monica
37393," Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it’s a little creepy. Y’know? I’m not a bachelor anymore.",chandler
37394," So don’t think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a…a two month anniversary present.",monica
37395," Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance! ",ross
37396, Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!,monica

37404,  I’m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby…,joey
37405," I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I’m really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.",phoebe
37406," I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn’t want him to start yelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour.",rachel
37407, It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.,phoebe

37418, Okay. I can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day.,chandler
37419, How does it feel knowing you’re never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you’re gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.,joey
37420," You’re right, this is more fun.",chandler
37421," That’s her! Okay, come on! ",joey
37422, Hi. ,chandler
37423," Uh, that-that’s-that’s me!",joey

37426," Yeah, yeah right over there.",chandler
37427, That was weird.,chandler
37428, Why-why would she go in the bedroom?,joey
37429, So she’s a…,chandler
37430," Yeah, that’s one naked hooker!",joey
37431, Uh that’s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.,ross
37432, So much more.,ross
37433," Aw forget it, it’s from Pier One.  Sorry. ",ross
37434, Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.,ross
37435, Who did?!,ross
37436," Yes. Yes, yes I did.  But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.",ross
37437," No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care—I-I love Rachel.",ross
37438,"  Oh but not that way. I mean…I mean I’m not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.",ross
37439,  Hey! I offered to marry her!,ross
37440,  But I didn’t want to.,ross
37441," I’m sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.",ross
37442, I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!,chandler
37443," Wait! Wait! Maybe she’s a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she’s supposed to do.",joey
37444," Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it.  Ma’am, are you also a stripper?",chandler
37445," Maybe Monica’s playing a joke on ya. Y’know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that’s pretty funny.",joey
37446," That is funny, maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone.",chandler
37447, I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.,joey
37448," Oh actually, I’d rather you…Yeah, go ahead. We’re gonna have to burn that room down anyway.",chandler
37449," I was going to tell you, but…",ross
37450, Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just…  Why don’t we just let the machine get that?,ross
37451,  Hey Ross. It’s Joey. There’s a hooker over here and we thought maybe you’d know something about it.,joey
37452," No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I—I need to, I need to lie down.",ross
37453, Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl’s number.,monica
37454, My husband.,monica
37455, She’s a stripper.,monica
37456," Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?",monica
37457, Oh my God Stu! I-I can’t believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she’s a hooker?,monica
37458, Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.,joey
37459, Why would she do that?,chandler
37460," Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you’re really bad at y’know, sexually?",joey
37461, This is the worst bachelor party ever!,chandler
37462, In a minute!,joey
37463,  In a minute? What’s gonna happen in a minute?!,chandler
37464," All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.",joey
37465, Why me?!,chandler
37466, Hey! It’s your bachelor party.,joey
37467, Which is why you should do it.,chandler
37468, I don’t want to. You do it!,joey

37474," No, I-I miss hanging out with you.",joey
37475, Well we…we still hang out.,chandler
37476, Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y’know now it’s like…things are different.,joey
37477," Well y’know, things are different. I’m…I’m married now.",chandler
37478," Oh sure—And hey, don’t get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just…I miss…hanging out…just-just us, y’know?",joey

37480, You got it. Come here. ,joey
37481,"  She’s a hooker! She’s a hooker! She’s a…  Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone. ",monica
37482, So your dad dropped by. He’s a pleasant man!,ross

37484, I’d better go.  Just over here: I don’t want to miss the fight.,phoebe
37485," Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.",rachel

37494, Thank you so much for coming back over.,ross
37495," I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I’m so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You’re gonna have to tell me how you did that.",rachel
37496, Focus.,ross
37497," Okay. Um…But—Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.",rachel
37498, Oh we just—we drove each other crazy!,rachel
37499, Yeah.,ross
37500," I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!",rachel
37501, Trying to date this woman.,ross
37502," Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is. ",rachel
37503, Probably shouldn’t touch me.,ross
37504," I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single?  I am so gonna leave right now. ",rachel
37505, Should I leave this open for you too?,ross
37506, Because what’s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.,ross
37507," I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel’s father. Look I…I made a mistake, but it’s only because I really, really like you. Really!",ross
37508,"  Forgot my purse!  Oh, you guys made up.  He’s a good kisser isn’t he?  I’m going! ",rachel
37509, I swear I didn’t know she was a hooker! I mean wh—Did you let her smoke in here?,monica
37510," Her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?",chandler
37511," Y’know what? I’m gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper , and you’re gonna get a stripper. ",monica
37512, Monica! Wait!,chandler
37513, What?,monica
37514,  Carry on.,chandler

37522,  Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions!  What gives you the right to…  Go to hell!  Stupid guy on my phone.,joey
37523," Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.",joey
37524,  Oh my…God! Let me see that! ,rachel
37525,  You fall for it every time!,joey
37526,  Hey!,phoebe
37527, Hi!,rachel
37528, I brought you my old maternity clothes! ,phoebe
37529," Oh Pheebs that’s so sweet——Ooh, those are so cute!",rachel
37530," Yeah! And look,  see how they expand as the baby grows?  And then after the baby’s born, they’re great for shoplifting melons.",phoebe
37531,"  Oh good you’re all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o’clock.  Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?",monica
37532, No.,rachel
37533," He was in Ross’s class…marching band…kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.",monica
37534," Wow! I don’t remember him. Honey, are you sure you’re not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.",rachel
37535," No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven’t thought about him in a long time…   Anyway, umm Will’s, Will’s here on business and he didn’t have a place to go so I invited him here.",monica
37536, Oh that’s nice.,rachel
37537," Oh, and by the way, he’s lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous!  I still love Chandler.",monica
37538, I just want you to say it once in a while.,joey
37539," All right okay, just so you know, I’m not gonna make a turkey this year.",monica
37540, What?!,joey
37541, Well Phoebe doesn’t eat turkey…,monica
37542, Phoebe!,joey
37543," Turkey’s are beautiful, intelligent animals!",phoebe
37544, No they’re not! They’re ugly and stupid and delicious!,joey
37545," All right! Okay, it’s just Phoebe. Will’s still on a diet, Chandler doesn’t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel’s having her aversion to poultry.",monica
37546, She is?,joey
37547, Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?,rachel
37548, Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.,joey
37549," Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work.",monica
37550," But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!",joey
37551, All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.,monica
37552, No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!,joey
37553," All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?",monica
37554," That’s right! ‘Cause I’m a Tribbiani!  And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don’t read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!",joey
37555," Hey, isn’t weird to think about how next year at this time they’ll be a little baby at the table?   Rachel’s! But good to know where you’re at!",monica
37556,  Hey!,phoebe
37557, Hey!,monica
37558, Happy Thanksgiving!,phoebe
37559, You too!,monica
37560, Anything I can do to help?,phoebe
37561," Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he’s really into the game so I don’t want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins? ",monica
37562, Sure!,phoebe
37563, I’m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.,monica
37564, Okay. ,phoebe
37565," No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barn dance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?",monica
37566," Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me.   So how’s the game?",phoebe
37567, I have no idea.,chandler
37568, What?,phoebe
37569, Yeah! I’m just pretending to watch the game so I don’t have to help out with stuff.,chandler
37570, I don’t believe you! That is…brilliant! And Monica has no idea?,phoebe
37571, Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.,chandler
37572, Is your team winning hon?,monica
37573, Yeah! Anderson just scored again!  There’s no Anderson.,chandler
37574," Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don’t think I can help you after all, I didn’t realize this game was on.",phoebe
37575," Oh, I didn’t know you liked football.",monica
37576," Well normally I don’t, but y’know……Green Bay is playing.",phoebe
37577, You like Green Bay?,monica
37578," Well it’s only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it’s not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }",phoebe
37579, Hey!,monica
37580, Aww thanks! God Will I’m so glad that you came! You look great! You must’ve lost like…,monica

37582," You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.",monica
37583," Oh hey. I’d shake your hand but uh; I’m really into the game. Plus, I think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next to each other.",chandler
37584, This is Phoebe.,monica
37585,  Hey.  Wow!  Well done.,phoebe
37586,  Wanna give me a hand?,monica
37587, Well you look incredible too! You’re just—you’re so fit!,monica

37590, Good. And Rachel Green too. ,monica
37591, Is there a problem?,monica
37592, What?,monica
37593,"  Y’know, it’s been a while since we’ve screamed something. Maybe we should.",chandler
37594, Oh okay.,phoebe
37595, Oh come on!,chandler
37596, Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!,phoebe
37597," Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you’ve got almost an entire turkey to eat.",monica
37598, Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin’ chips is like stretching.,joey
37599, All right.,monica
37600," Don’t worry, Tribbianis never get full.",joey
37601,  Who the hell is this guy?,joey
37602, Will! From high school.,monica

37631, Hi! I’m Rachel Green.,rachel
37632," Really?! Aren’t you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis’ graduation party?",rachel

37647, I’m-I’m—I had no idea. I’m sorry. I…,rachel
37648, Oh Will. But you-you’ve worked so hard…,monica
37649, Okay. ,monica

37651, You had a club?!,rachel
37652," Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?",rachel
37653," No need to point, she knows who Ross is.",ross
37654,  So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?,rachel
37655, No. No.,ross
37656, So who else was in this club?,rachel
37657," Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don’t think he-he knew what it was.",ross
37658," So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.",rachel
37659, That was in high school! It’s not like it was binding forever.,ross
37660," Okay Monica, did you know about this?!",rachel
37661, I swear I didn’t.  Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?,monica
37662," Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.",monica
37663," Look Rach I-I’m sorry, okay? I…I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined…",ross
37664, …co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn’t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.,ross
37665, Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?,rachel
37666, No-no! No-no. No-no.,ross
37667, What?! What else did you do?,phoebe
37668, What rumor?,rachel
37669," Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!",phoebe
37670, Ross!,rachel

37672, What?!,rachel
37673,  Oh my God!,rachel
37674, You started that?!,monica
37675, What?! You heard that?! ,rachel
37676, Everyone at our school heard it!,monica
37677, Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!,chandler
37678, Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn’t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!  ,rachel
37679," Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really our fault.",ross
37680," Monica, how come you never told me this?!",rachel
37681, I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.,monica
37682, Joey stop staring! There’s nothing there! It’s not true!,rachel
37683, I’m afraid I’m gonna need proof.,joey
37684, Oh! ,rachel
37685, You are my Everest.,joey
37686," Joey, you don’t have to finish that.",monica
37687," Oh yes I do. Otherwise what’s next? Today I’m just a guy who can’t finish a turkey, but tomorrow I’m the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just…I just—I gotta change my pants.  Jeans have no give. ",joey
37688,"  Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, ""Dear Rach, you’re such a good person."" Not girl! Person!",rachel
37689," Rach, I think you’re reading a little too much into it.",ross
37690,"  ""Dear Rach, you’re a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie."" ",rachel
37691," Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn’t true?!",ross
37692, Yes!,rachel
37693, Oh! Me too!,monica
37694, Well look-look I’m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!,ross
37695, I don’t care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y’know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.,rachel
37696, That’s not totally true.,monica
37697, What?,rachel
37698, What?,ross
37699," Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.",monica
37700,   How did you know that?!!!!,ross

37702, No.,ross
37703, Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!,rachel

37705, Hey! She didn’t look 50!,ross

37707," Ohh, there’s a picture of her in the yearbook actually.",rachel
37708, Oh!  Wow!,phoebe
37709, She didn’t photograph well!,ross
37710," Well, she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!",chandler
37711," So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?",phoebe

37849, Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?,chandler
37850," Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don’t really go with it.",monica

37869, I know.,rachel
37870," Oh, there you are Ben!",phoebe
37871," Well, I heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy’s name is Sting’s son.",phoebe
37872," Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.",phoebe

37877, Oh.,phoebe
37878, Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.,phoebe
37879," Yeah! Let’s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?",phoebe
37880," Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? ‘Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She’s such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.",phoebe
37881," Y’know, that party wasn’t bad.",chandler
37882, Yeah! I didn’t know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!,monica
37883," I don’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?",chandler
37884," Oh no, we can’t walk!",monica
37885," What honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’s go.",chandler
37886, Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?,monica
37887, What’s going on?,chandler
37888, I can’t walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!,monica
37889, What?,chandler
37890," Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They’re killing me! One toe at a time!",monica
37891, So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.  It’s oddly unsettling.,chandler
37892, How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?,monica
37893, Hop on.,chandler
37894," Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first.  Ah…Ooh…Oohh…Ohh…Oh God…Ohh…Oh…Ohh…Ohhhh…",monica

37903," Ahhh! I heard ""I do"", we’re halfway there! Okay!  You!",joey
37904," All right Joey! That is enough!  Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it’s not legal. Okay? They-they don’t have a marriage license, they don’t have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!",rachel
37905, Well what am I supposed to do?,joey
37906, You’re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.,rachel
37907, No they can’t! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!,joey
37908, Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective!  Right?,rachel

37917," Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o’clock?",phoebe
37918," Concert. Yeah. That does put us in…quite a pickle. Because you see I’m very busy before and after the concert, and he’s obviously busy during.",phoebe
37919," Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.",phoebe
37920," Oh, thank you. Four would be great.",phoebe
37921, Oh good! Then you’re in luck! Ben’s not my son!,phoebe

37929,  I don’t have your boots.,chandler
37930, Well I don’t have them either. Where are they?,monica

37936, Okay.  All right.,monica
37937, Okay. ,chandler
37938,  Bye boots—Wait! Half off?! ,monica
37939," Joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!",rachel
37940," Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let’s hear their plan! Now, what’s the future look like for Dina and Bobby?",joey
37941,  You were right. He is funny.,joey
37942," Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?",rachel
37943,  Really? ,rachel
37944," Dina, if you’re having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby!  Dude, that’s not a compliment!",joey
37945, So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You’re gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?! You can’t be a single mother alone! You’re gonna ruin your life!,joey
37946, Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?,rachel
37947, No! No! No! It’s different for you. You’re so strong and together. You’re not some dumb kid who doesn’t know what she’s doing.,joey
37948," One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.",joey
37949, So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?,rachel
37950," Maybe!  Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!",joey
37951, Because! ‘Cause… ‘Cause you’re my baby sister!,joey
37952," Well I’d be scared of them, but all right.",joey

37954, That’s right! By his uncle too!,joey
37955," Okay Bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment. ",rachel
37956, Come here! ,joey

37970," Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it’s like every guy I see—I mean look here.  Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I’m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.",rachel
37971," Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?",phoebe

38021," Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?",rachel

38023," Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!",rachel

38042, You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?,monica
38043," Yeah, we’re not just doing a card! Y’know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.",ross
38044, Ugh! Women!,phoebe
38045," I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, ""So, where is this going?""",ross
38046, Uh Ross? You asked me that.,rachel
38047," Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it.",ross
38048, Like asking her to move in with you?,monica
38049, Smaller than that.,ross
38050, Making her a mixed tape?,monica
38051," Uh, bigger than that.",ross
38052, Give her a key to your apartment.,phoebe
38053, Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.,ross
38054," All right. Have you said, ""I love you?"" You could say, I love you.",monica
38055," Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.",ross
38056," No, we hate that.",phoebe
38057, That is a slap in the face.,monica
38058," Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have the conversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?",ross
38059," I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.",rachel
38060," Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work.",chandler
38061, Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.,chandler
38062, It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.,chandler
38063, Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.,chandler
38064, Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.,chandler
38065, Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?,chandler
38066," Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.",chandler
38067," Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.",ross
38068," Aw, we-we are so… So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y’know hanging out with you. And I mean-I’m having a lot of fun. ",ross
38069," I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun. It’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going?  Ah! That’s-that’s the real question. And-and the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. Now I-I know what you’re thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re not getting any younger. No I mean—No not you, not you, you—you are getting younger. I mean—you-you look like you’re getting younger by the second—What’s your secret?",ross
38070," Well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young.",ross
38071, But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to my apartment. ,ross
38072, Really.,ross
38073, You gave her a key to your apartment?!,rachel
38074," Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.",ross

38091, Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this! ,phoebe
38092," Oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl.",chandler
38093, It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.,chandler
38094, Oh no-no-no!,chandler
38095," Okay, and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.",ross

38098, I love you!,ross
38099, Hi honey I’m home.,chandler
38100, From the tequila factory?,monica
38101," It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!",chandler
38102, Come here. I can breath through my mouth.,monica
38103," Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.",chandler
38104," I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?",monica
38105," Ooh, I don’t know if we’re there yet.",chandler

38111," Oh, what’s wrong?",joey
38112," Oh you really, you really just don’t want to hear about it.",rachel
38113, Then why did I ask?,joey
38114," Okay, it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put this umm, erotically charged.",rachel
38115, Is that college talk for horny?,joey
38116," Yeah. So y’know, I have all of these feelings and I don’t know what to do about them, because I can’t date like a normal person, which is fine because I don’t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just s*x, y’know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really so…hard…to find.  So how was your day?",rachel
38117," Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.",joey
38118," Well, I gotta get up early and it’s almost seven o’clock.",rachel

38171," You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone s*x, I’ll tell ya…",joey
38172," Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin’ all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I’m not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it’s so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.",rachel
38173," Hey, y’know what?",joey
38174, Huh?,rachel

38176," What?! Joey, you don’t want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.",rachel

38187, I don’t suck. It’s sucks. You suck.,chandler
38188," Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.",phoebe

38190, Why do you want to play this game so bad?,chandler
38191, Yeah! It’s not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.,phoebe
38192," Okay. Phoebe that’s it. Come on, get out—out of the chair. Get out!  Oh come…Phoebe!",monica
38193, Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?,rachel

38202," Ah… Hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?",joey
38203, Hm-mmm.,rachel
38204," Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?",joey

38206," No-no-no-no, he’s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!",joey
38207," …which brings us back, of course, to Greely’s theory of dominance.  Okay, that-that’s all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?",ross
38208," What?! That-that’s all the way cross town, I’m supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.",ross

38218, I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.,rachel
38219," Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.",joey
38220, Oh my God. And that works?!,rachel
38221," Well it does when you combine it with, ""This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!""",joey
38222," Oh, you poor little famous man.",rachel
38223," Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you’re so beautiful…I don’t think I can.",joey
38224,"  Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!",rachel
38225," Alright, so…so tell me one of your moves.",joey

38233," I don’t know. I guess there’s just always been this distance y’know—I mean we both try to pretend it’s not there, but it is.",joey
38234,  Oh.  It’s gotta be rough.,rachel
38235," Yeah, it is. It’s really tough. Y’know sometimes I think—Wow!! Nice move!",joey
38236, Huh?,rachel
38237," ""Where’d you grow up,"" it’s so simple!",joey
38238," Thank you! And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.",rachel
38239, Yeah.,joey
38240, And now you’re watching me walk away.,rachel
38241, Yes I am! Again so simple!,joey
38242, Hey.,monica
38243, You are not going to believe what I did today!,chandler
38244, Well it clearly wasn’t showering or shaving.,monica
38245, I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler.  Although I-I hope they don’t.,chandler
38246," Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!",monica
38247," Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five! ",chandler
38248, What is the matter with your hand?,monica
38249," Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours, it’ll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they’re dirty words.",chandler
38250," Chandler, why would you do that?",monica
38251, Because it’s awesome.,chandler
38252, You think this is clever?,monica
38253," Well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.",chandler
38254," Hey wait a minute, this one isn’t dirty.",monica
38255, It is when you put it together with that one.,chandler
38256," Ah, well if you don’t clear this off, you won’t be getting one of those from me. But Ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can’t be there.",monica
38257," Come on, he won’t even know what they mean.",chandler
38258, Chandler! He’s seven; he’s not stupid.,monica
38259, Have you talked to him lately?,chandler
38260," All right, look I’m just gonna unplug it.",monica
38261," No-no-no, if you unplug it, I’ll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work.  No!  Hey look at that! Look at that, it’s still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM  Chip in it or something!",chandler
38262, Honey you-you got to beat your scores!,monica
38263, With the claw?!,chandler
38264," All right fine. Fine, I’ll do it. I’ve just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.",monica
38265,  Pull my finger——My hand is messed up.,chandler
38266, I am not gonna answer that!,rachel
38267," Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?",joey
38268," No one! They are my friends, I wouldn’t punch any of them.",rachel
38269, Chandler?,joey
38270," Yeah, but I don’t know why. Look at me, I’m having such a wonderful time!",rachel
38271," Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!",joey
38272, I know!,rachel
38273, I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?,joey
38274," Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.",rachel
38275," I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.",joey
38276, Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.,rachel
38277, Huh. Huh.,joey
38278," All right, now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan.",rachel
38279," Ah! Okay, well then you don’t judge me. I’m gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before. ",joey
38280," So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?",rachel
38281," Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.",joey
38282, How do you do that?,rachel
38283," Now you can’t tell anyone, but uh…I put on shiny lip balm.",joey
38284, Oh my God!,rachel
38285," Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I’m telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.",joey
38286," No, I don’t want to tell you.",rachel
38287, Why not?,joey
38288, Because it’s embarrassing.,rachel
38289," More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?!  I didn’t say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!",joey
38290,"  Okay. All right, stand up.  Well, when we’re at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, ""Hmmm."" Okay, I know it doesn’t sound like anything, but I swear it works.",rachel
38291,"  Yeah. Why—Yeah, that would work for ya…",joey
38292," All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.",rachel
38293, Oh.  Yeah.  Me to. ,joey
38294," …you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!",rachel
38295," No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, ""Get the hell out of my way!""",ross
38296," Well, why didn’t you just take a cab?",rachel
38297," Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it’ll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?",ross
38298, Well you’re not gonna be able to keep doing this.,rachel
38299," Well I have to. Okay? If I don’t, they’ll take the class away from me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter.",ross
38300, You what?,rachel
38301," You’ve seen it, the Geller Yeller.",ross
38302, Right. Wow!,rachel
38303," Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I’m sure I can make it this time. I just…I just can’t be afraid to get a little bit…hit by cars. ",ross
38304, Hey!,joey
38305," Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?",rachel
38306," Oh yeah, I still can’t believe you haven’t seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?",joey

38323," Okay, I got that. I’ll escape over there. I’ll come back over here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It’s got—Right— Well, you’re just a little bitch, aren’t you?",monica

38348," No! No! Seriously, what’s wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?",rachel

38350, Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?,rachel
38351," Oh uh, okay. Yeah.",joey
38352," Y’know, I never thought I’d say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies.  What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me.",rachel
38353," Oh sure, yeah, why not? ",joey
38354," Okay.  Okay, that’s him! That’s him! That’s Cujo! That’s Cujo!",rachel
38355," All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it’ll be okay.",joey
38356," Oh my God….What’s he gonna do now? I can’t watch!  Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren’t you scared?",rachel
38357, Terrified. ,joey
38358," So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.  Here.  Here.  Now as for the hydrosaurs…",ross
38359,"  All right. It’s a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you don’t feel that now. It was crazy! You’re fine. You’re better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everything’s normal! She’s just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.",joey

38361,"  Hey, it’s your girlfriend, Rachel!",joey
38362,  Hi.,monica
38363," Are you, are you high?",chandler
38364, I just had the most amazing bath.,monica
38365, Really? I don’t like baths.,chandler
38366," Wait, you like them with me.",monica
38367," Honey, it’s not the bath I enjoy, it’s the wet, naked lady.",chandler
38368," Oh, baths are so relaxing!",monica
38369, Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.,chandler
38370," How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.",monica
38371," Honey, it’s 2:00 on a Wednesday and I’m watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?",chandler
38372,"  Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.",joey

38374," Well, neither.",joey
38375," Oh my God, what’s up?!",chandler
38376," I don’t know. It’s-it’s just…lately, I’ve been feeling… Okay, here’s what it is…  You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks! ",joey
38377," Oh no-no, no you don’t, just come back.",chandler
38378," All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that’s different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?",joey
38379, Do you?,chandler
38380," It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?",joey
38381, In London?,chandler
38382, Yeah.,joey
38383," Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.",chandler
38384," You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.",joey
38385, If that.,chandler
38386," Hi! Oh, Ross, don’t forget, we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!",rachel
38387, Right.,ross
38388," Hey, are you going to find out the s*x of the baby?",phoebe
38389," No-no, we talked about it. We don’t want to know. All we care about is that it’s happy and healthy.",ross
38390, Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!,rachel
38391, And smart!,ross
38392, Popular.,rachel
38393, With an aptitude for science.,ross
38394, Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?,phoebe
38395, Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!,rachel
38396, Really? Me too!,ross
38397, Me too!,phoebe
38398, Really?!,rachel
38399," Uh huh! If it’s a girl, Phoebe, and if it’s a boy, Phoebo!",phoebe
38400," Maybe. But it wouldn’t hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking? ",ross
38401," Okay! I was thinking if it’s a girl, how about Sandrine? It’s French.",rachel
38402, Huh. That’s a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.,ross
38403," Okay fine, what do you have?",rachel
38404," Well, OK, it’s for a boy. Well, I know it’s a little out there, but…Darwin.",ross
38405," Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.",rachel
38406," Yeah, by Sandrine.",phoebe
38407, You’re just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!,ross
38408," I’m really, really not.",rachel
38409, How-how about you each get five vetoes?,phoebe
38410, All right.,ross
38411, All right.,rachel
38412, That sounds fair.,ross
38413," Yeah! I don’t think you’re going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it’s a girl, Rain.",rachel
38414, Veto.,ross
38415, Why?,rachel
38416," Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.",ross
38417, I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!,phoebe
38418," Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?",ross
38419," Ross, why do you hate our child?",rachel
38420," Fine, you go.",ross
38421," Okay, James.",rachel
38422, Huh.,ross
38423, But only if it’s a girl.,rachel
38424," Oh, veto. How about—Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?",ross
38425, Oh! I’m sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?,rachel
38426, Veto. Stewart?,ross
38427, Veto. Sawyer?,rachel
38428, Veto. Helen?,ross
38429, Veto.,rachel
38430," Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?",phoebe
38431, Hey.,chandler
38432," Boy, do I have a surprise for you!",monica
38433, s*x on the balcony?,chandler
38434," No, but someone’s really not going to get over that idea, are they?",monica
38435, What is it?,chandler
38436, I drew you a bath!,monica
38437," Honey, I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having s*x on the balcony?",chandler
38438," Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it’s a boy bath!",monica
38439," Well, this does butch it up a bit.",chandler
38440," I swear, if you try it, you will love it!",monica
38441," All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss s*x on the balcony?",chandler
38442, Absolutely.,monica
38443, Bet I know how that discussion’s going to go.,monica
38444,"  All right, this isn’t so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I’ve got my boat.",chandler
38445,  So?,monica
38446, Oh my God.,chandler
38447," I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!",monica
38448, I’m going to need a bigger boat.,chandler
38449," I don’t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?",ross
38450," Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!",rachel
38451," Uh, no. No, we’re not.",ross
38452, But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it’s a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?,rachel
38453," No, no, we want to wait, right?",ross
38454, Right. Right.,rachel
38455,"  So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?",rachel
38456," What? Rach! Come on, that’s terrible! They’re…uh…they’re babies. They’re-they’re all beautiful.",ross
38457, Third one from the left?,rachel
38458," Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I’m talking about it.  Don’t-don’t you—Wh—Wha—Hey!!",ross
38459, What?!,rachel
38460, You’re looking!,ross
38461, I didn’t!,rachel
38462, I saw you!,ross
38463," Okay fine, I did. But I didn’t see anything, I swear.",rachel
38464, Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!,ross
38465," Okay, but Ross just listen to me…",rachel
38466," No, no, no, no! Don’t tell me! I don’t want to know!",ross
38467," But I couldn’t even if I wanted to, because I don’t know! I swear; I didn’t see anything, and I don’t want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.",rachel
38468, Momentary lapse. Don’t-don’t you have any self-control?,ross
38469,"  Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.",rachel
38470, Hello?,monica
38471," I’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there’s something wrong.",chandler
38472, You know what? I-I think I’ll wait out here.,monica
38473, I’m in the bathtub.,chandler
38474, Oh.  What’s wrong?,monica
38475," I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’t compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!",chandler
38476, What?,monica
38477, The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different.  It’s interesting.,chandler
38478," Okay, let’s talk about something else.",monica
38479," Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!",chandler
38480," Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and…",monica
38481, I had the exact same conversation.,chandler
38482, You did? What was he talking about?,monica
38483, I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!,chandler
38484,  That was a long night.,monica
38485," All right, let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?",chandler
38486," Okay, he was talking about rules.",monica
38487, Uh-huh.,chandler
38488," Umm, and looking at people differently.",monica
38489, He didn’t say anything about that to me.,chandler
38490, What did he tell you?,monica
38491," He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.",chandler
38492," Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.",monica
38493, But what did he mean by rules?,chandler
38494, Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!,monica
38495, Because he was looking at her differently.,chandler
38496," And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!",monica
38497, My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!,chandler
38498,  You guys?,phoebe
38499, Just a minute!  That’s Mrs. Tribbiani!,monica
38500, You don’t say anything.,chandler
38501," Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?",monica
38502, I’m not going to let you say anything.,chandler
38503, You just stay here! ,monica
38504," Oh, God!",chandler
38505," Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.",phoebe
38506," Oh, you had that?",monica
38507, Uh-huh.,phoebe
38508," I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.",monica
38509," Oh, just as well, I broke this one.",phoebe
38510, What?,phoebe
38511, Nothing.,monica
38512, Okay.,phoebe
38513," I mean, I-I, I really shouldn’t say. I mean, I’m really not supposed to.",monica
38514, Fine.,phoebe
38515, It’s a humdinger!,monica
38516, Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me.,phoebe
38517, Somebody likes you!,monica
38518,  Is it Chandler?,phoebe
38519, No!,monica
38520," Well, then tell him to stop staring!",phoebe
38521, It’s Joey!,monica
38522, Really?! Joey?! You don’t say.,phoebe
38523, Is it something you’d be interested in?,monica
38524," I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No, I can’t. We’re friends. No, oh, no. I don’t want to risk what we have.",phoebe
38525," I guess that makes sense. So, you think you’re going to talk to him?",monica
38526," Sure, yeah. I mean, it’s Joey. I don’t want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!",phoebe
38527," Not Chandler, just Joey.",monica
38528, Sure.,phoebe
38529, Hey.,rachel
38530, Hey.,ross
38531, You know what? I’ve been thinking about it. I’m really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.,rachel
38532," Rach, I-I can’t tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh… Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we’re never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it’s a boy!",ross
38533, I didn’t see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.,rachel
38534," I don’t think so! You’re just giving me Ruth so you’ll get to name it when it’s a boy, and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.",ross
38535, I would—Sequoia?,rachel
38536, Veto.,ross
38537, Fine.,rachel
38538," Unless…  You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I’m not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!",ross
38539," But Ross, you want the name Ruth!",rachel
38540, Not like this!,ross
38541, Hey.,phoebe
38542," Hey. Well, what’s up?",joey
38543," Umm, Joey, I know.",phoebe
38544, What?,joey
38545, I knooow.,phoebe
38546, Whaaat?,joey
38547, I know about your feelings.,phoebe
38548, Oh my God. You do?,joey
38549," Yes, and I’m sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that’s very rare.",phoebe
38550," I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it’s Rachel for God sakes.",joey
38551," For God sakes, it’s Rachel!",phoebe
38552, I know. I know. And she’s not only my friend; she’s my pregnant friend! She’s my pregnant friend who’s Ross’ ex!,joey
38553, Yeah that’s Rachel.  Beat me over the head with it.,phoebe
38554," What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y’know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don’t like about her. You want to hear it?",joey
38555, Yeah.,phoebe
38556," She made me switch to light Mayo. That’s it! That’s all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!",joey
38557," Joey, I just think you’re getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.",phoebe
38558, You think?,joey
38559," Absolutely! Y’know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.",phoebe
38560," Yeah, just a crush! That’s all this is! It’s a crush! I’m Joey; I don’t get deep feelings.",joey
38561," That’s right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I’ve had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I’m sure you’ve had them for us.",phoebe
38562, Not really.,joey
38563, Mm-hmm.  Throw me a bone here.,phoebe
38564," So, I uh… I called the doctor and now we both know the s*x of the baby.",ross
38565, What?,rachel
38566, That’s right. The student has become the master.,ross
38567," Ross, I swear, I don’t know.",rachel
38568," Oh, come on, you know it’s a girl!",ross
38569, A what?!,rachel
38570, You really didn’t know?,ross
38571, We’re having a girl?,rachel
38572, No.,ross
38573, That’s what you just said!,rachel
38574, No.,ross
38575, You said girl!,rachel
38576, Yes. I’m… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.,ross
38577, I’m not! We’re having a girl! Sometimes I can’t believe it’s with you—But still! We’re having a girl!,rachel
38578, I know! I know. You know what? I’m putting Ruth back on the table!,ross
38579," Oh, yes! We’ll have ourselves a little baby Ruth…",rachel
38580, Permission to veto.,ross
38581," Yes, please.",rachel
38582, Hey.,monica
38583, Do I smell essential oils?,chandler
38584," Yeah, I’m going to take a bath. I’m just going to get a magazine.",monica
38585, Okay.,chandler
38586, What do you think you’re doing?,monica
38587, L-leaving my troubles behind?,chandler
38588," I know that you’re new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.",monica
38589," Oh, it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed.",chandler
38590," Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you’re just a girl in a tub!",monica
38591,  Hey!,chandler
38592," Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.",phoebe
38593,  You told her?!,chandler
38594, She pulled it out of me! She’s like a conversational wizard! How’d it go?,monica
38595," Well, you were wrong, he doesn’t like me!",phoebe
38596, What?,monica
38597," Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors’ house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn’t like you? How would you feel?",phoebe
38598,  I don’t think I’d care.,monica
38599, Really? Lee Majors is hot!,phoebe
38600,  Hello?,joey
38601, We’re in the bathroom!,phoebe
38602, Why?,joey
38603,  Because it’s a relaxing and enjoyable time!,chandler

38605," Oh my God! A friend he’s looking at differently, but it’s wrong. It’s Rachel!",monica
38606, You like Rachel?!,chandler
38607," It’s no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It’s just a crush! It’s going to go away!  Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!",joey
38608,   Mazel tov.,phoebe
38609,"  Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here?  Oh, my! ",rachel

38613,"  Well hey! What’s going on? Ooh, cool boat——Oh, no.   Hey, did you, did you tell them?",ross
38614," No, I was waiting for you!",rachel
38615, Tell us what?,phoebe
38616, We’re having a girl.,rachel
38617, I’ll…I’ll get you later!,chandler
38618,"  All right. It’s a new day, and it’s just a crush, that’s all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, ""it was cuckoo!"" Everything’s going to be fine. It’s just a crush.",joey
38619,"  Hi, sweetie.",rachel
38620,  I love you.,joey

38785," So, howâ€™s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?",chandler
38786," Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now.  Wow, you sure found that quick.  I justâ€”I wish I didnâ€™t feel this way about Rachel anymore, yâ€™know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I thinkâ€¦I think Ross feels left out. Yâ€™know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. Godâ€¦ You shouldâ€™ve seen the look on Rossâ€™s face.  By the way, I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing here. For all I know Iâ€™m just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?",joey
38787, Thatâ€™s a good idea.,chandler
38788, Yeah.,joey
38789," Okay.  So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?",chandler
38790," Oh, I justâ€¦I feel terrible.",joey
38791," Well, itâ€™s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Yâ€™know? Youâ€™re doing nothing wrong.  Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby.  Richard? If-if youâ€™re in there, could you pass me my credit card?",chandler
38792, Hey.,monica
38793, Hey.,phoebe
38794," I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!",monica

38806, What?! Youâ€™re crazy! Thereâ€™s nothing sexual about the noises I make!,monica
38807, Really? Thereâ€™s nothing sexual about this?  Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh.   What are you looking at?!  I mean hi.,phoebe
38808," Oh myâ€”This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, Iâ€™m never gonna get massaged again!",monica

38819, Well yeah!,ross
38820, Oh Ross!! ,rachel
38821, What?! What?! Rach what?!,ross
38822, Whatâ€™s going on?,joey
38823," I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.",ross
38824, Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.,joey
38825,"  I-Iâ€™m sorry Rach, I didnâ€™t know. Are you gonna be okay?",ross
38826," Yeah, Iâ€™ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?",rachel
38827, Iâ€™m on it! ,joey
38828, I canâ€™t believe this! I shouldnâ€™t be the one making her throw up!,ross
38829, Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.,joey
38830," Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I donâ€™t know any of it and Iâ€™m the father. I wish Iâ€™d be more involved yâ€™know.",ross
38831,"  Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.",rachel
38832," Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?",joey

38835," Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.",joey
38836,  Are you breaking up with us?,rachel

38838, Yeah?,rachel
38839, Maybe you two should live together.,joey
38840, Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?,rachel
38841," Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems thatâ€¦if youâ€™re gonna have a roommate, yâ€™know it might as well be the father.",joey
38842," But Joey, I donâ€™t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I meanâ€”â€”Or he does.",rachel
38843, No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.,ross
38844," But Ross, its you and me!",rachel
38845, So? Sure! But it-it wouldnâ€™t be anything romantic. And Iâ€™m-Iâ€™m dating Monaâ€”Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!,ross
38846," All right now, so? What do you think?",joey

38863, Wellâ€¦itâ€™s just ummâ€¦Iâ€™m afraid you might mess it up.,monica
38864, Hey.,chandler
38865, Hey.,joey
38866, So Rachelâ€™s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?,chandler
38867," Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldnâ€™t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, itâ€™s a couple weeks past itâ€™s expiration date, so itâ€™s got a bit of a kick.",joey
38868, Are you okay?,chandler
38869," Are you kidding me? Iâ€™m great! Yeah, Iâ€™m uh; Iâ€™m better than great. I am good. And now that sheâ€™s gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldnâ€™t do before. Yâ€™know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Yâ€™know? I can uh, I can watch p0rn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Yâ€™know? I like being on my own, Iâ€™m uh, better off this way. Iâ€™m uh, a lone wolf. Yâ€™know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. Whatâ€™s a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?! ",joey

38893," So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?",phoebe
38894," Oh, I’m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she’s been away all week visiting her parents, but she’ll be cool. I mean, she’s been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, ‘Fossils are my friends.’",ross

38935, What is it?,monica
38936," It’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. Oh, the dilating…",chandler
38937," Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe’s. Why were you even watching it?",monica
38938, I thought…maybe…you got me p0rn for Valentine’s Day.,chandler
38939," Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you p0rn for Valentine’s Day…  you were right! Apparently, it’s about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having s*x with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts!  Oh, wait a minute. Those aren’t stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?",monica
38940," Well, I’m not really in a sexy mood right now.",chandler
38941," Honey, what’s going on?",monica
38942," Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?",chandler
38943, Mm-hmm.,monica
38944, How long it took to go back in the water?,chandler
38945," Chandler, we can’t let this tape wreck Valentine’s Day!",monica
38946, You don’t know. You didn’t see it.,chandler
38947," Child-birth, it’s a natural thing! It’s beautiful.",monica
38948," Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? ",chandler
38949," Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!",monica
38950," See, honey, there’s—",chandler
38951, Don’t touch me!,monica
38952," Hey!  So, how was Atlantic City?",ross
38953, Yeah?,ross
38954," Wha—? Oh, come on. You didn’t have to—saltwater taffy?!  Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it’s actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That’s not interesting.",ross
38955, I do too! I missed you!,ross
38956," Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!",ross
38957, Yeah! I know! It was. Oh… the only sad thing is I wasn’t around when it happened for the first time.,ross
38958," Yeah, I’m missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.",ross
38959, What?,ross
38960,  Huh…uh-huh.,ross
38961,  Just a second! ,ross
38962, How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?,phoebe
38963," I don’t know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!",ross
38964," Taffy, really? I’ve never had any.",phoebe
38965, Ever?!,ross
38966," Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.  Thank you! So what, you’re just never going to tell her?",phoebe
38967," Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I’m the best boyfriend in the world, then I’m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.",ross
38968," If I haven’t said it before: she’s a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going to—what the mother of crap is up with this stuff?  Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? What’s the deal?  Oh, it’s nice! May I try a pink one?",phoebe
38969," So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn’t going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.",joey
38970,  Hey!,phoebe
38971, Hey.,joey
38972," Hey, buddy. How’s my favorite dog, huh? How’s my favorite dog?  You’re subdued.  Did you give him a beer?",phoebe
38973, No.,joey
38974," Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.",phoebe
38975," Yeah, sure. Go ahead.  Oh, me, right!",joey
38976, He’s miserable! What happened to him?,phoebe
38977, Nothing. We just talked about stuff.,joey
38978, What stuff?,phoebe
38979, Rachel stuff.,joey
38980," Oh…Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!",phoebe
38981, He’s breathing!,joey
38982," Okay, I’m going to take him back to Wendy’s.",phoebe
38983," No, no, no, no! He’s fine! Look, look, look!  Here’s your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball!  Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!",joey
38984," Well, I’m, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?",ross
38985," Oh, I’ve got big Valentine’s plans! I’ve got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!",rachel
38986," Y’know, it’s interesting! Most people think that’s made with seawater, when in fact—",ross
38987," Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.",rachel
38988, Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! ,rachel
38989,"  Mona? What are—hi! What are you doing here? I’m, um, supposed to pick you up!",ross
38990, Ayyyayyyy!,ross
38991,"  Oh, hey, Mona!",rachel
38992, I have no idea!,ross
38993, I’ll be watching TV if anybody needs me. ,rachel
38994," Uh…lately, she just likes hanging out here.",ross
38995, I think she’s lonely.,ross
38996, I know.,ross
38997," No, no. She’s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.",ross
38998, I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!,rachel
38999," Mm-hmm. She’s—she’s emotional, but, but ballsy.",ross
39000," You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed! ",rachel
39001," And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don’t you, uh, open the champagne, and I’ll be right back. I’ve got a surprise for you.",ross
39002,  Please start drinking! ,ross
39003,  I’m just going to grab the phone.,rachel
39004," Oh, I’m sorry! Do you need the phone?",rachel
39005,"  But, but, Mona, I live here.",rachel
39006,  Happy Valentine’s Day! …Or something to remember me by.,ross
39007, How long has it been this time?,monica
39008, 90 seconds.,chandler
39009, That’s better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it…except all I did was think about it.,monica
39010," You know, it haunts me? Up ‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!",chandler
39011," Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don’t we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?",monica
39012, I can do that.,chandler
39013, Okay.,monica
39014, Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.,chandler
39015," Oh, thank God!",monica
39016," Oh, I know!",chandler
39017, Come in!,monica
39018,"  Hi! I’m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine’s, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.",rachel
39019," Oh, my God.",monica
39020, Poor Ross.,chandler
39021," Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!",chandler
39022," Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here.",monica
39023," Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don’t watch it.",chandler
39024, Why? You saw it? Is it scary?,rachel
39025," Well, let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.",chandler
39026," Well, now, wait. Now I’m all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.",rachel
39027," No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!",monica
39028," C’mon, seriously, you guys, you’re not going to make me watch this alone!",rachel
39029," She’s right…of course not. Honey, get the tape.",monica
39030,"  This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.  Okay, here we go.",chandler
39031," Okay.  Ooh, my!  Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!",rachel
39032, Why have I seen this thing three times?!,chandler
39033, It’s…still beautiful.,monica
39034, Uh! It’s horrible!,rachel
39035," I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!",monica
39036," Oh, my God!",rachel
39037," Wait, you guys, look!",chandler
39038, What? Did her ass explode?!,rachel
39039," No, the baby’s out! Look, look!",chandler
39040," Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!",monica
39041, And look how happy the mom is now!,chandler
39042, Oh…Rach!,monica
39043," Oh, screw you guys, you don’t have to do it!",rachel
39044," Hey, hey, man!",ross
39045," Hey, what’s up?",joey
39046, Uh…Mona just dumped me.,ross
39047," Oh, man, I’m sorry. Why?",joey
39048," Well, with everything that’s been going on lately, I haven’t exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn’t tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?",ross
39049," Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine’s Day.",joey
39050," Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine’s Day? What’s going on, huh? Girl trouble?",ross
39051, Sort of.,joey
39052, Really?!,ross
39053, You don’t have to seem so happy about it.,joey
39054," Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.",ross
39055," Oh, I…I d—",joey
39056," Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y’know, actually once—once I got dumped during s*x.",ross
39057," Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?",ross
39058, Forget about it. It’s no big deal.,joey
39059, C’mon! Joey! What is it?,ross
39060, It’s nothing.,joey
39061," Hey, hey, it’s me. Why can’t you tell me?",ross
39062," Okay, uh…sit down.  Um… there’s this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh…it can’t happen.",joey
39063, She’s not a Tribbiani?,ross
39064, No!,joey
39065," I knew it. So, is she someone from work?",ross
39066, Yes.,joey
39067," Well, uh, does she like you?",ross
39068," Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn’t matter, because I can’t do anything about it.",joey
39069, Why not?,ross
39070," Well, it’s complicated. She’s with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we’re really good friends.",joey
39071," So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he still in love with her?",ross
39072, No. I don’t think so.,joey
39073, Okay. Um… is he a good guy?,ross
39074," Yeah, he’s the best.",joey
39075, Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.,ross
39076," Oh, I don’t know.",joey
39077," Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.",ross
39078," I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—",joey
39079," Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.",ross
39080," I’m going to…uh…I’m going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.",ross
39081," Oh, yeah.",joey
39082," Anyway… seriously, uh…just…just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes. ",ross
39083, It’s Rachel.,joey
39084,"  You’re going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, you’re going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it! ",rachel
39085,  Hmm…maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.,rachel
39086," There’s this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, it’s complicated.  She’s with this other guy.  For a long time.  And I could never do that to the guy, y’know?  ’Ccause we’re really good friends.",joey
39087," So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he a good guy?",ross
39088," Yeah, he’s the best.",joey
39089, Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.,ross
39090," Oh, I don’t know.",joey
39091," Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.",ross
39092," I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—",joey
39093," Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself. ",ross
39094, It’s Rachel.,joey
39095,"  Did you um—I’m sorry, did you just say it’s Rachel?",ross
39096, Yes.,joey
39097," Um, you…you like Rachel?",ross
39098, Yes. I like Rachel.,joey
39099, Rachel?!,ross
39100,"  Yeah, okay but look, buy uh—Hey-hey, y’know, y’know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn’t get said enough. I like you Ross.",joey
39101, But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!,ross
39102," Yeah, but it’s not a big deal.",joey
39103," It’s not a big deal? Oh, I’m sorry I just…um, I…what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like—you-you can’t stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?",ross
39104," I’m an actor, y’know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.",joey
39105, Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?,ross
39106," Look no, I-I know it’s bad, and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-but it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are just feelings, they’re gonna go away.",joey
39107, Y’know what? I-I gotta go. ,ross
39108, Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don’t…,joey
39109,  I just—y’know—I-I just have one—Rachel?!,ross

39115, I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.,chandler
39116,  Oh hey you guys!,phoebe
39117, Oh hey!,chandler
39118, Hi!,rachel
39119," Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?",phoebe
39120, Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.,rachel
39121," Uh-huh,  and you?",phoebe
39122," No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don’t think they exist.",chandler
39123," Okay, good.",phoebe
39124, Why?,chandler
39125," Well last night, I met Monica’s.",phoebe
39126, What?,chandler
39127," Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.",phoebe
39128," Come on, don’t be crazy.  You don’t think there’s someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? ",chandler
39129,"  Well, what’s he like?!",rachel
39130, Well he’s tall.,phoebe
39131, Uh-huh.,rachel
39132, He has brown hair.,phoebe
39133," Of course, of course.",rachel
39134," A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!",chandler
39135, He works with food!,phoebe
39136, Oh sure. Older?,rachel
39137," Obviously, and he’s British.",phoebe
39138," Oh, I was just gonna ask!",rachel
39139," Yeah? And, he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.",phoebe
39140," Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.",rachel
39141," Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.",chandler
39142," Oh, I’m so sorry. Um, and maybe I’m wrong! I but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again, I’ll find out more.",phoebe
39143, You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?,chandler
39144," Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat.",phoebe
39145, Hey.,monica
39146, Hey.,ross
39147," I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were.",monica
39148," Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out, only weirder!",ross
39149," All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don’t say that again.",monica
39150," Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he’d be the stepfather of my child.",ross
39151," Honey, I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about! First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she’d react.",monica
39152," Sure, because women never like Joey. Y’know, I think he’s a virgin.",ross
39153, Joey…he’s not even thinking about going after Rachel!,monica
39154, He’s not?,ross
39155," No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean, listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont.",monica
39156, Why?,ross
39157, He says he wants to leave the country.  He thinks you hate him.,monica
39158," Hate him? I… No, I don’t hate him.  It’s just it’s Rachel, y’know?",ross
39159," Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you’re still his friend.",monica
39160," Okay. Okay, I’ll talk to him.",ross
39161," All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.",monica
39162, Oh! Hi!,phoebe

39176, What are you doing?!,chandler
39177, Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…,phoebe
39178," I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!",chandler
39179," They’re just talking, and y’know what? Just because I think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.",phoebe
39180,"  Phoebe, good work.",monica
39181, Yeah?,phoebe
39182," Yeah! Oh he’s great, I love him. ",monica
39183," Don’t worry, we’ll find you someone else.",phoebe
39184, Hey.,joey
39185, Hey.,ross
39186," Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.",joey
39187," No, I don’t want to hit you.",ross
39188, Oh what then? Kick me?,joey
39189, No.,ross
39190,  Bite me?,joey
39191," No, no I don’t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I’m not mad at you and…and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that. ",ross
39192, Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?,joey
39193, Uh…yeah sure. ,ross
39194," Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don’t…",joey
39195, Okay.,ross
39196,"  Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh…I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. ",joey
39197, Thank you.,ross
39198," Anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over her, that’s all. I’m not even sure how to do that, I mean I’ve never been in love before so…",joey
39199, What?! You’re in love with her.,ross
39200," Yeah, I thought you knew that.",joey
39201," Umm, no.",ross
39202," Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don’t want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, ""Ah, I’ll get over this."" Y’know? I just—It just keeps gettin’ harder. I don’t, I don’t know what to do. Y’know? What do I do?",joey
39203, I think you need to tell her how you feel.,ross
39204, Okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.,joey
39205," No, I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.",ross
39206, But what if uh—and I’m not saying she will be—But…,joey
39207, If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it shouldn’t stand in the way.,ross
39208, Are you sure?,joey
39209," Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn’t find a better guy. So…",ross
39210, Hey thanks.,joey
39211, So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?,ross
39212, Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven’t even thought about what I will say. What should I say?,joey
39213," I’m understanding, but let’s not get carried away.",ross
39214," I’m sorry, you’re right. What am I gonna say?  Oh!",joey
39215," Yeah, tell me about it. ",ross
39216," Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?",chandler
39217," Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.",chandler
39218," Me too! Yeah, Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.",monica
39219," You know what I’d love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese—Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries…  And pate. Oh, I’m really not high, it’s just I used to be fat.",monica
39220, Is it made of cheese?,chandler
39221, I’d move in tomorrow!,monica
39222,  Oh come on!  Are you listening to this?,chandler
39223, I’m so sorry.,phoebe
39224, What do we do?,chandler
39225," I don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don’t know how you fight that.",phoebe
39226," Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight.  Take a couple deep breaths.  Look confident. ",joey

39245, I don’t believe in soul mates either.,monica
39246, You don’t?,chandler
39247, No. I don’t think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.,monica
39248, So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?,chandler
39249," No, I’ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?",monica

39313," All right so, so what do I do?",joey

39318, I didn’t know you read tea leaves.,chandler
39319," Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life is it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.",phoebe
39320," Okay, I’m done. Read mine.",monica
39321," Okay.  Ooh, I see a ladder.  Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.",phoebe

39328," Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.",rachel
39329, What does yours say Pheebs?,chandler
39330," Umm… Wow, all right.  Wow! Yay! Ooh, I’m gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he’s gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. ",phoebe

39337, That’s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!,ross
39338, Well just ask Mona to give it back!,rachel
39339," I don’t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It’s just that we didn’t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I’d be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. ",ross
39340,"  Oh wait a second you guys…for the last couple weeks I’ve been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he’s the tea guy. ",phoebe
39341," Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!  Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?",chandler

39348," I know it’s tough now, but things will get better.",chandler
39349," How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!",rachel
39350," I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?",chandler
39351," Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?",monica

39360, Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!,rachel
39361," Okay, I-I’m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.",monica

39555," It’s just that, it’s so much.",monica
39556," Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you’ve dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don’t do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? ‘Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who’s who of human crap. ",phoebe
39557, I feel terrible.,monica
39558, I know,joey
39559, What was wrong with Mona?,ross
39560, Open it! Open it! Open it!,rachel
39561, Yeah baby!,ross
39562," No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.",ross
39563," But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.",rachel
39564," On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn’t She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.",rachel
39565," Yeah, Stevie’s an old family friend. ",rachel
39566, So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.,rachel
39567, Would you excuse us for a second?  Umm…. what are you doing?,ross
39568, What? I’m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.,rachel
39569," Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.",ross

39575," Okay, fine! Fine!  Mmm…hmmmmm….",phoebe
39576, Why don’t you just try one?,phoebe
39577, What are you doin’?,chandler
39578, Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit ‘em. I can’t wait. They’re going to be crying so hard. They’re going to be fighting for breath.,monica
39579," Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could .",chandler
39580," And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.",rachel
39581," Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.",rachel
39582," Well, I don’t know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.",rachel
39583, Oh yeah. That’s a great story.,rachel
39584," Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That’s-that’s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower…",ross
39585, Shhh! I want to hear the rest!,rachel
39586," Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words ""Will you marry me?""",ross
39587," And the ring, was the size of my fist !",rachel
39588," Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker’s a nice guy and I’d like to get to know him.",joey
39589, Then you better do it now.,phoebe
39590, Why?,joey
39591, Because I’m going to kill him,phoebe
39592, What-what?,joey
39593," You guys were right. He’s just too excited about…everything. I mean I’m all for living life, but this is the Geller’s 35th anniversary. Okay? Let’s call a spade a spade this party stinks.",phoebe
39594," I know I’m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!",joey
39595, Are you sure it wasn’t an oyster?,phoebe
39596," I guess it could’ve been, I didn’t really look at it. Y’know, I just wiped it on Chandler’s coat and got the hell out of there.",joey
39597, He’s just such a great guy I’m so excited about him.,phoebe
39598," Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There’s nothing wrong with him he’s a good guy.",joey
39599, You think?,phoebe
39600, Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.,joey
39601," You’re right. You’re right, he’s just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I’m a sunny, positive person.",phoebe
39602," Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.",joey
39603, What’s that now?,phoebe
39604, Nothing…,joey
39605, Oh look it’s Parker!,phoebe
39606, Oooh I love it!,phoebe
39607, Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!,phoebe
39608," Okay it’s time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I’m going to do it.",monica
39609," No, no it’s going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don’t say it enough, but I love you.  When I look around this room, I’m-I’m saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can’t because she’s dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. . Was.  Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she’s dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment?  Didn’t see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love.  You people are made of stone! Here’s to mom and dad! Whatever!",monica
39610," Oh, no, Mom, it’s just Monica this year.",ross
39611," No, of course, Um… Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say…on behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself. Umm, that if…if in 35 years, we’re half as happy as you guys are, we’ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.",ross
39612, Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?,phoebe
39613, Oh thank God.,phoebe
39614," Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don’t we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!",phoebe
39615," Let’s try something else, let’s play a game.",phoebe
39616, Shocking! Let’s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest. ,phoebe
39617," But, let’s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!",phoebe
39618, Oh my God! Oh my God!,phoebe
39619," Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn’t perfect? Everything isn’t magical? Everything isn’t a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!",phoebe
39620, You don’t have to put a good spin on everything.,phoebe
39621," No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!",phoebe
39622, Much less happy!,phoebe
39623, So long! Don’t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out! ,phoebe
39624, Uh huh. ,phoebe
39625," …and then, we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!",ross
39626," Ross, it just wouldn’t have been feasible.",rachel
39627, But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no problem?,ross
39628, It was really fun being married to you tonight.,rachel
39629," Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I’ve ever made.",ross
39630," Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?",rachel
39631, Yeah.,ross
39632," That proposal, at the planetarium…",rachel
39633," I know, I know it was stupid.",ross
39634," Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was…really wonderful! Did you just make that up?",rachel
39635," No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It’s how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.",ross
39636," Well, that would’ve been very hard to say no too.",rachel
39637," It’s a good thing I didn’t do it, because it sounds like it would’ve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night",ross
39638, Goodnight,rachel
39639, Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messed up?,ross
39640, I will think about it.,rachel
39641, That’s all I’m askin’,ross
39642," Okay that’s it. I give up. At mom and dad’s 40th anniversary, you’re the one giving the speech.",monica
39643, Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.,ross
39644," Oh, come on.",monica
39645," Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.",ross
39646,"  Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?",monica
39647, Hi!,rachel
39648, Hey!,ross
39649, Hey!,monica
39650," So, I’m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. ",rachel
39651,"  Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That’s me!! I’m blank!!",joey
39652, How cool is this?! We know three down! I’m touching three down! ,monica
39653, Yeah you are baby.,joey
39654," Three down knows I’m married, what’s three down doin’?",monica
39655, So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?,rachel
39656," No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.",joey
39657, Why’d you say no?,ross
39658," Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.",joey
39659, If only there was something in your head to control the things you say. ,chandler
39660," Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?",rachel
39661, Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?,chandler
39662," Okay, don’t listen to him. Please?",rachel
39663," Fine! All right, I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y’know, start to say something stupid.",joey

39665," Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green.  Ha-ha! I’m gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle.  Seriously, proud of you.",rachel
39666, Yeah.,joey
39667," Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.",joey
39668,  You think we’re being obvious?,monica
39669," No, we’re just four people with neck problems. You talk like this. ",chandler
39670,"  Actually, I didn’t know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn’t have mattered, I’m doing this for the fans, not for the free food.",joey
39671, And I’ll have all the muffins.,joey
39672,  Hey!,phoebe
39673, Shhh! We’re not talking.,ross

39679," Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do…so I just watch 'em have s*x. And then I say, wait, here's my line,  you know that's bad for the paper tray.",joey
39680, Nice work my friend.,chandler
39681," Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am…",joey
39682," Well, there are so many things, it’s hard to pick just one.",joey
39683," I’m gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?",phoebe
39684," Oh yeah, I’d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.",rachel
39685," Uh, double latte, extra foam.",ross
39686, And a bagel with only…,chandler
39687,  I was just being polite!,phoebe

39726," It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!",rachel

39948, I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.,chandler
39949, Why did you invite my mother?!,rachel

39962, I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It’s time to open the presents!,phoebe

39974," Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!",rachel
39975," Well that’s gross, why don’t you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?",rachel
39976, What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!,rachel
39977," Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.",monica
39978," I don’t know, I’d leave it on the changing table?  What?! What’d I do? What’d I do?!",rachel
39979," Oh come——Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would—she wouldn’t be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y’know what?

40066, Uh-huh!,phoebe
40067," Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green!  It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn’t on purpose! But what you’re during to me now is just plain spiteful!",monica
40068, That’s right! Maybe it’s time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady…old lady…lady!,monica
40069,"  Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up…",phoebe
40070," So whenever you’re ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day!  I can’t feel my legs!",monica

40276,"  Why? What, what are you jealous?",ross
40277," Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don’t want you to go out with anybody! Okay?

I’m very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.",rachel

40321, You. Like you haven’t done enough.,rachel
40322," Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse.  Because with seahorses it’s the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I’d be far away in the sea. ",ross

40350, So you’re never actually going to pay me back?,chandler
40351," Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you’re gonna take him? Joey, I don’t think you’re comprehending just how slutty this dress is!",monica
40352," It’s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it’s-it’s everything. Y’know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn’t get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn’t believe in myself.",joey
40353, I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.,chandler

40384, She’s in the bathroom.,monica
40385," Rach, we gotta go.",ross
40386, In a minute!!!,rachel
40387," People ask me why we’re not together, I just don’t know what to tell them.",ross
40388,"  All right, all right. Let’s go!",rachel
40389," Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry…",ross
40390," No, I’m fine.",rachel
40391, Really? You don’t think that’s a little inappropriate. ,ross
40392, Good God man don’t anger it.,phoebe

40394, Fine! Fine! Y’know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You’re the mommy.,ross

40409, Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.,rachel
40410," Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don’t we not speak until then.",ross
40411,"  Okay.  Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That’s great!",rachel
40412, Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!,ross
40413," Hi Dr. Long, how are you?",rachel
40414,"  Oh, you’re nice to her.",ross
40415, She has the drugs!,rachel

40436, Hey.,ross
40437, Hi!,rachel
40438, What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?,monica
40439, No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.,rachel
40440," Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.",ross
40441," Well, there is one thing that we haven’t tried, but someone thinks that,  ""That will open up a can of worms.""",rachel

40448," All right, let’s be practical, if Ross isn’t willing to do it, he’s not the only guy in the world you can have s*x with. You can borrow Chandler—Chandler is good!",monica
40449," Monica, what is the matter with you?",ross
40450, Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.,monica
40451, Why? Why today?,rachel
40452, Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!,monica
40453," What?! While she’s been going through this hell, you’ve been making money?! You’re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! ",ross

40873, Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.,rachel
40874, Really?,rachel
40875," Well… That’s…y’know—That’s—We’ve been alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay. Besides y’know what? I-I—Maybe we won’t be alone, ‘cause lately I-I—things have been happening between me and Ross, y’know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y’know? So it might be the…the beginning of something.",rachel
40876,  Hey Janice!,ross

40895," Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous, it’s all Rachel.",ross
40896," I’m sorry, for the last time, why aren’t you two together again?  No, I know. I know, because you’re not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.",phoebe
40897, It’s…it’s complicated okay?,ross
40898," Yeah that’s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.",phoebe
40899," Look, we’ve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.  It’s just if-if we got together again and it didn’t work out…I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything— Oh that’s…now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we’re doing really, we’re doing really well right now.",ross
40900," I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.",phoebe
40901," Yeah, exactly.",ross
40902, Right.  Or you might get everything you’ve wanted since you were fifteen.,phoebe
40903, Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here.  What’s the matter?,joey
40904, Nothing.,rachel

40955, What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?,ross
40956," Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.",phoebe
40957,"  Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?",joey
40958, Sure.,chandler
40959, Dude I just did something terrible.,joey
40960, That was you?! I thought it was Jack!,chandler
40961," No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!",joey
40962, What?! Why does she think that?,chandler
40963, Because it kinda looked like I did.,joey
40964," Again, what?!",chandler
40965," Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…",joey
40966, As we all are at some point during the day.,chandler
40967, It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!,joey
40968, Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?,chandler
40969, I guess.,joey
40970, And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!,chandler
40971, I know! I know it’s awful.,joey
40972," Well, what did she say?",chandler
40973,  She said yes.,joey
40974, Does Ross know?,chandler

40976, Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.,chandler
40977," Oh, I like that. Yeah…",joey
40978," If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!",chandler
40979,  Now let’s not get carried away. ,joey
40980, I want a baby.,monica
40981," Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.",chandler
40982," Come on! Come on, if we have s*x again it’ll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?",monica

40992, Oh my God! He did it?,phoebe
40993, Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?,rachel
40994, Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.,phoebe
40995, And you really think this is a good idea?,rachel
40996," I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.",phoebe
40997, I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.,rachel
40998," Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.",phoebe
40999, Really?! Even Ross?,rachel

41008," It can’t be me, I’m standing right here.",joey

41019," Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.",rachel
41020, Dear Lord.,joey
41021," I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?",rachel
41022," Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…",joey
41023," Oh look, she’s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?  She looks scared. Doesn’t she look scared?",rachel
41024," Y’know, I don’t really know her.",joey
41025,  Are you kidding me?!,joey
41026, It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!,rachel
41027, I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy! ,joey
41028, Oh hey! Wait up!,phoebe
41029, Hi!,ross
41030, Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey ‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet.,phoebe
41031," What, that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.",ross
41032," No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!",phoebe
41033, What?,ross
41034," Oh, it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secret thing in a long time.",phoebe
41035," Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose.",ross
41036, Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?,phoebe
41037,  I am a doctor! Y’know what? I’m just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.,ross
41038," All right, me too.  Should we wake her up?",phoebe
41039," No! No, come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted.",ross
41040, And so engaged. ,phoebe
41041, What?  Oh my God! She-she thinks we’re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we’re engaged?!,ross
41042, Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.,phoebe
41043, I didn’t give her that ring!,ross
41044, Really?,phoebe
41045, No!,ross
41046, So whose ring is it?,phoebe
41047, It’s mine.,ross
41048, Is it an engagement ring?,phoebe
41049, Yes!,ross
41050, But you didn’t give it to her?,phoebe
41051, No!,ross
41052, But you were going to propose?,phoebe
41053, No!!,ross
41054," Huh, I might be losing interest in this.",phoebe
41055," Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…kinda…wanted ah…start…things up again.",ross
41056," Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.",phoebe
41057," Look, I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn’t want to either. But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?",ross
41058," No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.",phoebe
41059, Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose!  Unless uh…  Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I would do.,ross
41060," Look, we can’t stay in here forever.",chandler
41061," Oh, I still can’t believe my dad saw us having s*x! He didn’t make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!",monica
41062," This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. ",chandler
41063, Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?,monica
41064," I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn’t for fun.",chandler
41065, It wasn’t fun?!,monica
41066,"  Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why…  Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.",chandler
41067," The truth is, Dad, we’re-we’re trying.",monica
41068," Yeah, we’re trying to get pregnant.",monica
41069," Well, that’s okay dad, we-we can wait until later.",monica
41070, Daddy?!,monica
41071," That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.",chandler
41072, Daddy! I don’t think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had s*x.,monica
41073, I don’t feel good right now.,monica
41074," Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.",chandler
41075, Hey.,monica
41076, Hey. I need to tell you something.,rachel
41077," Well, now’s a good time. I’m on my way to have my ears cut off.",monica
41078, Joey asked me marry him.,rachel
41079, What?,monica
41080, Joey proposed to me.,rachel
41081, Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!,monica
41082," Well, I-I said yes.",rachel
41083," What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross’s baby! It’s-it’s so inappropriate. No, it’s worse than that. It’s wrong. It’s… It is bigger than mine! ",monica
41084," I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.",rachel
41085, You can’t marry him!,monica
41086, Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.,rachel
41087, Well do you love him?,monica
41088, Sure.,rachel
41089, Sure?,monica
41090," Yeah, I mean whatever.",rachel
41091," Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?",monica
41092," No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?",rachel
41093, You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?,chandler
41094," No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.",joey
41095," Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look like?!",chandler
41096, I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.,joey
41097, Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.,chandler
41098," Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don’t want to hurt her.",joey
41099," Okay, look, just do it gently.",chandler
41100," You’re right. You’re right. I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I’ll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.",joey
41101, Hey.,ross

41105," And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um…I didn’t propose to you.",ross
41106, I know.,rachel
41107, I don’t think you do.,ross
41108, You didn’t propose to me. Joey did.,rachel
41109," Poor baby, you’re so tired. Rach, I didn’t propose to you, Joey didn’t propose to you, and Chandler didn’t propose to you.",ross
41110," Uh… You didn’t propose to me, Chandler didn’t propose to me, but Joey did.",rachel
41111, Joey proposed to you?,ross
41112, I can come back.,joey
41113," Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?",ross
41114, No.,joey
41115, Yes you did!,rachel

41558, Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.,chandler
41559,"  Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York.

41563," You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.",phoebe
41564," Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.",joey
41565," That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!",joey

41582, You're right.  Maybe I shouldn't go.,monica

41584," So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.",monica
41585, How far outside?,chandler
41586, Manhattan.,monica

41589, What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?,chandler
41590," Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.",monica

41602, Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?,chandler
41603," Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.",rachel
41604," Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'",ross
41605, Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?,chandler
41606," Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!",ross
41607, That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!,chandler
41608, It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!,ross

42439," Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?",chandler
42440," No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.",monica
42441," Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.",chandler
42442," What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.",monica
42443, What is the point of having them if we never use them?,chandler

42481," Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.",phoebe
42482, I do not.,joey
42483," Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?",phoebe
42484," Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said ""Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's"" and he said.. <pause> He said.. ""Joey you stink at lying."" What am I going to do?",joey
42485," Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it.",phoebe
42486," Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.",joey
42487," Sure, what.. what was the work thing?",phoebe
42488," Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks>",joey
42489," ""Pick up grandma at the airport""?",phoebe

42495," I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.",ross
42496," Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.",rachel
42497, What? What happened?,rachel
42498, Don't say that.,ross
42499," Oh Amy, don't cry Amy.  Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?",rachel
42500," Sure, you want to go upstairs?",ross
42501, Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.,rachel
42502," You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.",ross
42503," Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.",rachel
42504," Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.",ross
42505," Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just going to have to make our peace with that!",rachel
42506," Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy.  This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.",rachel
42507," Pheebs, I still need some help here",joey
42508," Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.",phoebe
42509, Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.,joey
42510, Oh we just put her down for a nap.,rachel
42511, Thats a great movie. <she claps>,phoebe
42512, Emma.,ross
42513, PHOE-BE.,phoebe
42514," Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby.",rachel
42515," Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.",ross
42516, I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.,chandler
42517," yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.",monica
42518," See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.",rachel
42519," You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>",chandler
42520, Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.,monica
42521," Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>",monica
42522, Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?,joey
42523," No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.",monica
42524, I can't believe I won.,joey
42525, Monica is Ross' sister.,rachel
42526, That was me.,monica
42527, Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.,rachel
42528," Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.",monica
42529," No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?",chandler
42530, Well actually...,rachel
42531, Actually what?,chandler
42532," well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.",ross
42533, What?,chandler
42534," So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?",chandler
42535, Yeah he's lying. He looked down.,joey
42536, Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!,chandler
42537," Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.",rachel
42538, Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.,ross
42539," Thats not how you see me, is it?",monica
42540," Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?",chandler
42541," No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.",ross
42542, Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up.,chandler
42543," Sure, Monica would have to give her up.",ross
42544," I lie better then that, right?",joey
42545," So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?",chandler
42546, There's your movie! <claps>,phoebe
42547, Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.,monica
42548, Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?,chandler
42549, Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.,monica
42550," Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.",chandler
42551, No you learn these things. You grow into it.,monica
42552," Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.",chandler
42553, I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.,monica
42554," Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""Go to your room! You're grounded""?",chandler
42555," Can you hear me say ""You're grounded""?",monica
42556, You said that to me last week.,chandler
42557, How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.,monica
42558, It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.,phoebe
42559," Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.",joey
42560," Ooh, what happened?",phoebe
42561, No! Nothing with a raccoon.,phoebe
42562," Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. <throws hands out in the air>",joey
42563, Oh wait.. What are you doing?,monica
42564, Setting the table.,joey
42565, Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.,phoebe
42566, Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.,monica
42567," Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.",ross
42568," Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.",chandler
42569, UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy's>,rachel
42570, Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?,rachel
42571, What? What carrer?,rachel
42572, Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.,rachel
42573, Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.,rachel
42574, I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.,rachel
42575, Emma.,ross
42576, ooh oooh..,joey
42577, uh huh.,rachel
42578," Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?",rachel
42579, Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!,rachel
42580," I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.",rachel
42581, ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It's forty five.,rachel
42582, You take that back.,rachel
42583, Take it back!,rachel
42584," Heey man, I work out.",rachel
42585, I do pilates.,rachel
42586, Bring it on!,rachel
42587, Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!,monica
42588, Did you just push me?,rachel
42589, Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back>,rachel
42590, Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?,phoebe
42591, What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.,joey
42592, Ew! Gross.,rachel
42593," Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.",chandler
42594," Mon, I'm so sorry.",rachel
42595, Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.,chandler
42596," By the way, that fight was totally arousing.",chandler
42597," Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.",ross
42598, Oh yeah? Well thanks.,chandler
42599," So, so now do I get Joey?",ross
42600," Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.",chandler
42601, Are you okay Mon?,rachel
42602, uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.,monica
42603, It's all right. You can mourn.,phoebe
42604," Actually its not pies, its just pie.",joey
42605, I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.,monica
42606," Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..",rachel
42607, Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.,rachel
42608, She needs changing.,rachel
42609," Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.",chandler
42610," Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?",phoebe
42611, Nope...,chandler
42612," Broke them all, huh?",phoebe
42613, Yep...,chandler
42614, You gonna tell her?,phoebe
42615," Nope...  Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.",chandler
42616, Like only if the queen comes?,monica
42617, Maybe not even then. ,chandler
42618," Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs.",joey
42619, No problem! Next week: stealing... ,phoebe

42637, But-t it’s courtside! The cheerleaders are gonna be right in … [mouths last words so Monica does not hear them]. That’s not the way to convince you.,chandler
42638," Look. I don’t want to be one of those wives that says “You can’t go to the game”, “you have to spend time with me”, so, if you just realize it on your own?",monica
42639, I…I…I know. You’re right. I wanna see you too. I’ve just got to figure out a way to tell Joey. He’s really looking forward to this.,chandler
42640, [On phone] Tell him you haven’t seen your wife in a long time. [In apartment] Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that…what little time that we have is precious.,monica

42682," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Joey can’t know that I am here.",chandler
42683, Why not?,monica
42684," Because I didn’t know how to tell him that I couldn’t go to the Knicks game, so I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.",chandler
42685, So you lied to him?,monica
42686," Eh, it is always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion. [Monica glares at him] Except with you!",chandler
42687, Hey! Open the door! What’s going on?,joey
42688, Hi!,monica
42689, Why are you dressed like that?,joey
42690," [Nervous giggle] Because I, erm, well, Chandler’s gonna be home in a couple of days, so I thought that I would just, er, practice the art of seduction.",monica
42691, I thought I heard a man’s voice before?,joey
42692," I was just doing Chandler’s side of the conversation, y’know like “Hi”, “How do I look” [In Chandler’s voice] “Really sexy”, “Could I be any more turned on?”",monica
42693," Woah, woah, woah. Why are there two glasses of wine out?",joey
42694," Because, one of them is for you! [Monica goes to get a glass. Chandler looks at Joey through the peep-hole and Chandler ducks. Monica comes back to the door with the two glasses of red wine. Gives one to Joey. ‘Clinks’ the glasses together] Okay, bye, bye!",monica
42695," You know, it’s funny. I’ve been practising the art of seduction as well! Hya! [Does a wiggle]",chandler

42701, What? Why?,chandler
42702, Come home!,joey
42703," Look, I can’t. What’s going on?",chandler
42704," I don’t know how to tell you this, but I think that Monica’s cheating on ya! I told you that you shouldn’t have married someone much hotter than you! Chandler looks at Monica. They nod then put their ears back to the phone. Joey walks out of his apartment and up to Monica’s door] Right, look. If you can’t come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna…",joey
42705, [Loudly] No!,chandler
42706, I just heard him!,joey

42709, [Loudly] No! Wait!,chandler
42710, I heard him again!,joey
42711, Right. Just stay there. I'm coming home.,chandler
42712, Great. I’ll see you when you get here. I’m gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.,joey
42713, Is that really necessary?,chandler
42714," Absolutely. You’d do it for me! Not that you’d ever have to, ‘cos I know how to keep my women completely satisfied.",joey
42715, Shouldn’t the pizza be here by now? They said 30 minutes or less. How long has it been?,ross
42716, I do. I do. Although it is actually a lager.,ross
42717, I don’t know. We can look it up.,ross
42718," Oh, god. Do you remember the girls’ nights that we used to have? Sitting around, talking about you and Ross?",phoebe
42719," Oh, god. It seems like forever ago.",rachel
42720, I know.,phoebe
42721, So what’s going on with you and Ross?,phoebe
42722," Well, um, I don’t know. I mean, for a long time, nothing. You know, actually, right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a little thing.",rachel
42723, Woah! Oh my god! I love things! What happened?,phoebe
42724," Well, um, first he told me that he liked how I looked, and then, erm, we had a little, erm, eye contact.",rachel
42725, Eye contact?,phoebe
42726, Uh huh.,rachel
42727, I hope you were using protection.,phoebe
42728," Should we send them something back? Yes, let’s do! Let’s send them mashed potatoes!!",phoebe
42729," No, wait, don’t do that! It’s gonna make them think that they can come over here!",rachel
42730," So, what if they do?",phoebe
42731, We’re not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend. I have a…baby and a Ross.,rachel
42732," Yeah, but, um, nothing has to happen. Just having fun. You know, not everything has to go as far as ‘eye contact’.",phoebe
42733," Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you are not in Tulsa.",monica
42734, Don’t you think it’s better for him to think that you’re cheating on me than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? [Silence] I heard it!,chandler
42735, I don’t want him to think that I'm having an affair.,monica
42736, Alright. I’ve got a plan. I’ll go down the fire escape…,chandler
42737, Yes. Because all good plans start with “I’ll just go down the fire escape…”,monica
42738," Hear me out, woman! I’ll go down the fire escape, then I’ll wait for a while. Then, when I come back up the stairs, it’ll just be like I got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in here and see that there is no guy in here.",chandler
42739, Aren’t you afraid that Joey’s going to figure all this out? [Silence] I heard it!,monica
42740, Just gonna wait for a little while.,chandler
42741, Scary pigeon’s back?,monica
42742, It’s huge!,chandler
42743," Oh my god! I can’t believe you live in that building! My grandmother lives in that building, Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kinda smells of chicken? Looks like a potato?!?",rachel
42744, Yeah! That’s my muppy!,rachel
42745," Yeah, I’m sorry. We weren’t really looking for anything to happen with you guys. I-I have a boyfriend.",phoebe
42746," Oh, it’s complicated. I don’t actually have a boyfriend, but, erm…",rachel
42747," I’m sorry, no.",rachel
42748," Oh, sure!",rachel
42749, Oh my god! You’re giving your real number!,phoebe
42750, Great. [Gives thumbs up],rachel
42751," Wow. So that's great. You, Bill, Ross and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?",phoebe
42752, I don’t know. He was cute and he liked me. It was an impulse.,rachel
42753, But what about Ross? What about your moment? Don’t you want to talk to Ross about it?,phoebe
42754," No, no, ‘cos I know exactly how the conversation is going to go. “Hey Ross”, “You know, I think that we had a moment before” [As Ross] “Yeah, um, me too” [As herself] “Well, but I’m not sure I really wanna do anything about it!” [As Ross] “Yeah, um, me, um, neither.” [As herself] “Ross, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we’re really feeling?” [As Ross] “Yeah, that works for me, um, um.”",rachel
42755," Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation. But your Rachel was not whiney enough.",phoebe
42756, Hey!,rachel
42757, Better!,phoebe
42758," The point is: maybe I should stop waiting around, waiting for moments with Ross. I should just move on with my life.",rachel
42759," So, really? Are you moving on from Ross?",phoebe
42760," Dunno, do I have to decide right now?",rachel
42761, You kinda just did. That guy’s gonna call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone. That’s a pretty clear message.,phoebe
42762," Oh my god! Ross!! Ross is gonna pick up the phone! Ah, I have to get my number back! Oh my god! He’s gone!",rachel
42763," [As Rachel] “Ah, I have to get my number back!”, “Oh my god! He’s gone!” Dead on!",phoebe
42764, So soon?,ross
42765," Okay. Thanks, er, for the beer.",ross
42766," Ah, yeah, good times.",ross
42767, Ohh. [Relieved that Mike has gone],ross
42768," Hey Mike, it’s me. Listen: Is Ross near you?",phoebe
42769," Well, you have to go back in.",phoebe
42770," I’m so sorry, honey, but, okay. Rachel gave this guy her number, and, erm, she does not want Ross to answer the phone, so you have to intercept all of his calls.",phoebe
42771, [To Rachel] He says that he can’t do that,phoebe
42772," Oh, give me. [Rachel takes the phone of Phoebe] Hi, Mike! Hi, listen, I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what. If you do this, ah, Phoebe will do anything you want. Seriously, I’m talking dirty stuff.",rachel
42773," Alright, give it here. [Phoebe takes the phone] Hello? I'm sorry about her, but, she wasn’t wrong about the dirty stuff.",phoebe
42774," Oh, oh, Mike! Bye. [Hangs up]",phoebe
42775, Hi!,ross
42776, W-Why? [Blocking route of entry],ross
42777," [Exasperated] But, you left!",ross
42778," Wow, that didn’t take long. I thought you said Tulsa was a three-hour flight?",joey
42779," Well,… you’re forgetting about the time difference.",chandler
42780," Huh, Chandler – you’re home!",monica
42781," That’s right. Your husband’s home, so now the s*x can stop.",chandler
42782, What are you saying?,monica
42783, Joey said that you’re in here with another man!,chandler
42784, There's no man in here! How dare you accuse me of that? [Slaps Chandler],monica
42785," Alright, alright. Then maybe you won’t mind if me and my friend takes a look around then. Huh! Where you at?",joey
42786, What’s he doing?,chandler
42787, I arranged some pillows on the bed to make it look like a guy!,monica

42793," Nobody here, Joe.",chandler
42794, I guess not.,joey
42795, I can’t believe you thought I was cheating. You owe me an apology.,monica
42796," You’re right, Monica. I’m so sorry.",joey
42797," It’s an honest mistake. It can happen to anybody. Alright, see ya.",monica
42798," Wait, wait, wait a minute. If you’ve just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?",joey
42799," I climb down the fire escape, and you can’t put that in the closet?",chandler
42800, [Looking bored] Maybe you should look up fascinating.,ross
42801, I don’t understand what just happened here.,ross
42802, What’s going on?,joey
42803, I’m sorry. I told you that I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I didn’t…didn’t know…didn’t think you’d understand.,chandler
42804," What? You think I’m too dumb to know that a husband needs to be with his wife? Uh? You think I’m like, duhhh! [Taps head with baseball bat – it hurts him]",joey
42805, Joey?,monica
42806, Yeah?,joey
42807, I don’t know what to say. We shouldn’t have lied to you.,monica
42808," I feel so bad. Is there, is there anything I can do to make it up to you?",chandler
42809," You could go to the game with me, even though I know you said you couldn’t, but then you lied to me, tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.",joey
42810, I’m sorry. That’s the one thing I can’t do. I promised that I’d be with Monica.,chandler
42811, [Looking sad] Alright.,joey

43042," Oh, you're so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what",monica
43043," Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two",chandler

43046, How many kids were we gonna have?,monica
43047," Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",chandler
43048, What else did you think about?,monica

43096, I don't have a *job*!,chandler
43097, Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks,chandler
43098," You are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to",monica
43099, Hey!,chandler
43100," Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.",monica
43101, I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.,chandler
43102," Well, I just lost my erection.",monica
43103," I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?",chandler
43104, You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.,monica
43105, But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.,chandler
43106," Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There",monica
43107, Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!,chandler
43108, I know!!! My erection is back!,monica
43109,  Thank you!,joey
43110," Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?",phoebe
43111, Okay.,joey
43112,": Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?",joey
43113," I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.",phoebe
43114, If you want I could loan you some money?,joey
43115," Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.",phoebe
43116," Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?",joey
43117, You could do that?,phoebe
43118," Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.",joey
43119," Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!",phoebe
43120," Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.",joey
43121," Oh, really?",phoebe
43122, No it is awesome!,joey
43123, Hi guys.,ross
43124," Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?",phoebe
43125, Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?,ross
43126, She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?,joey
43127," Well, because if one more person says ""what a cute little boy"" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!",rachel
43128," I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?",ross
43129,"  Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key",monica
43130, How long was I in there?,chandler
43131, Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.,monica
43132, Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!,chandler
43133, Don't you want to look through the rest?,monica
43134," I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.",chandler
43135," You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!",monica
43136," I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? ""Cheese. It's milk that you chew."" ""Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy."" ""A grape.",chandler
43137," I got one. ""Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best.""",monica
43138, Honey? Leave it to the pros.,chandler
43139, I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.,monica
43140," ""The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones.""",chandler
43141," ""Marriage. It's not for everybody.""",monica
43142, That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.,rachel
43143," Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.",ross
43144, I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff .  Who the hell are you!?,rachel
43145, I'm the hell person whose office this is!,rachel
43146," Good one, Rach.",ross
43147, Excuse me?,rachel
43148," Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!",phoebe
43149," Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?",joey
43150, Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.,phoebe
43151," Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.",joey
43152," Okay, now. What?",phoebe
43153," I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.",phoebe
43154," Okay, that helps.",phoebe
43155," Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too!  Alright, eight.",joey
43156," No, no. But let me show you what I can do. ""Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood.""",chandler
43157, Really? That's great!,chandler
43158," It's funny. When you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid.""",chandler
43159," Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have s*x tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right",chandler
43160," Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?",rachel
43161, A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.,rachel
43162," Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way",rachel
43163, Excuse me?,rachel
43164, Rach we have a code brown situation.,ross
43165," Can you please, please take care of it for me?",rachel
43166," Alright, but you have to do one sometime.",ross
43167, Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?,rachel
43168, That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.,rachel
43169," Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?",rachel
43170, Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?,rachel
43171," Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.",rachel
43172," That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?",rachel
43173,"  Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.",rachel
43174, Today.,rachel
43175," No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.",rachel
43176, Hey.,joey
43177," Hey. So, what did he say?",phoebe
43178," Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word ""puppy."" Okay, so he said: ""If your puppy friend doesn't get",joey
43179," I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.",phoebe
43180," That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.",joey
43181, Joey.,phoebe
43182," No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she",joey
43183, Who dies?,phoebe
43184,  Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.,joey
43185," Yes, doctor.",phoebe
43186, Okay.,joey
43187," Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!",phoebe
43188,"  Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?",phoebe
43189," Okay, from the top, people!",phoebe
43190," Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.",rachel
43191," What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...",ross
43192," Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.",rachel
43193, What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.,ross
43194," I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?",rachel
43195, Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.,ross
43196," Come on, I don't know what else to do.",rachel
43197," Fine, fine.  We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will. ",ross
43198, Ross?,rachel
43199, Huh?,ross
43200, You're pretty.,rachel
43201," Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be",chandler
43202, So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?,ross
43203, Yeah.,chandler
43204,  Good-bye.,ross
43205,"  Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing.  Didn't see you there Geller.",monica
43206," Yeah, Ross is here so...",chandler
43207," Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?",ross
43208, We're gonna have s*x.,monica
43209, I don't feel like having s*x. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.,ross
43210, Let me put it this way. We're having s*x whether you're here or not.,monica
43211, Pants off Bing!,ross
43212," Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?",rachel
43213," Hey, they were popular when I left!",rachel
43214," Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?",rachel
43215," Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just",rachel
43216,  Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?,rachel
43217," Fine, I will.  Alright, fill me in!",rachel
43218, Hey.,ross
43219, Hey.,chandler
43220, You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.,ross
43221," Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.",chandler
43222,"  Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.",monica
43223, Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!,ross
43224,  Sorry.  But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.,monica
43225," Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.",chandler
43226, What are you talking about?,monica
43227, That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.,chandler
43228, What!? You faked it?,monica
43229," You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual ",ross
43230," Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?",phoebe
43231," Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.",joey
43232," Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.",phoebe
43233," Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.",joey
43234," Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.",phoebe
43235, Nice.,joey
43236, Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?,phoebe
43237," No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.",joey
43238, About what?,phoebe
43239, He slept with you and then never called you.,joey
43240, And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.,phoebe
43241," Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.",phoebe
43242," Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!",joey
43243," Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me",rachel
43244," Except that!  Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.",rachel
43245," What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.",rachel
43246," Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy",rachel
43247," No, I can't, I have a baby.",rachel
43248, Why would you do that?,rachel
43249, That's really nice.,rachel
43250," Then you're not gonna like what's coming.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.",rachel
43251, Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.,joey
43252," Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?",joey
43253," Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?",joey
43254, I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.,phoebe
43255, You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.,joey
43256," Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.",phoebe
43257, What?,joey
43258," Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!",phoebe
43259,"  Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.",joey
43260, You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!,monica
43261, Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.,chandler
43262," Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?",monica
43263," That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little",chandler
43264, Like a month?,monica
43265, Or a year?,chandler
43266," Really, you want to wait a year?",monica
43267," It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. ""Pants. Like shorts, but longer.""  It'll probably be more than a year.",chandler
43268, I really wanna have a baby.,monica
43269," Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.",chandler
43270," No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.",monica
43271, I quit and you learn what I do?,chandler
43272," It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really",monica
43273, I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.,chandler
43274," It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I",monica
43275, Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?,chandler
43276," Yes, please!",monica
43277," Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.",chandler
43278, I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!,monica
43279, Hey,chandler
43280, Hey. So where's Mon?,joey
43281," Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.",chandler
43282, And you're not helping?,joey
43283," I tried, but apparantly singing ""I will survive"" in a helium voice - not helping.",chandler
43284, Hey you guys!,ross
43285," Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.",rachel
43286," Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.",ross
43287," Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.",ross
43288," You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.",joey
43289," Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.",rachel
43290," OK, thank you.",rachel
43291," Yeah, you too.",joey
43292," Oh, wow, Molly is just great!",rachel
43293, Yeah.,ross
43294," Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.",chandler
43295, What? You really think she's hot?,rachel
43296, Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.,chandler
43297, And Joey?,rachel
43298, How do you think she's doing?,joey
43299, Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?,rachel
43300," Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....",ross
43301, Thank you! ,rachel
43302, Now that Rachel's gone?,chandler
43303, So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. ,rachel
43304," Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?",phoebe
43305," No. It starts with a ""v"" and ends with an ""x"". Helpfully with a ""to"" in the middle.",phoebe
43306, What?,phoebe
43307,"  Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.",phoebe
43308," Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.",phoebe
43309, What are those?,phoebe
43310," OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.",phoebe
43311," So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers. ",phoebe
43312, Hello.,rachel
43313," Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.",rachel
43314," Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...",rachel
43315," No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.",rachel
43316," Hello.  But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ...  I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.",rachel
43317, I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!,rachel
43318," Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.",rachel
43319," Oh yeah, I'm jealous. ""Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass"".  Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.",rachel
43320," That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.",rachel
43321," It was ...  oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just ""Tag"". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.",rachel
43322," Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!",rachel
43323," Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?",rachel
43324," Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.",joey
43325, Sure.,joey
43326, Would you stop staring at her?,monica
43327, I wasn't staring. I was leering.,chandler
43328, What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.,monica
43329," Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.",ross
43330, Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.,chandler
43331," Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.",monica
43332," Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ...",ross
43333, They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.,monica
43334,"  Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.",rachel
43335, Why not?,joey
43336," Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.",rachel
43337," So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?  Yeah, sounds about right.",joey
43338," Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.",ross
43339," Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!",joey
43340," What are you, a child?",ross
43341, Yes!,joey
43342," Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.",ross

43344,  Take me home! ,monica
43345, Hey Mikey,phoebe
43346, What are you doing?,phoebe
43347, To kill Bob??,phoebe
43348," No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.",phoebe
43349," I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob?  Bob! Robert!  Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!",phoebe

43355," Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?",ross
43356, You don't trust him?,chandler
43357," Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the ""hot nanny"".",ross
43358," Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.",chandler
43359," You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?",ross
43360," Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have s*x with it.",chandler
43361," Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. ",ross
43362, Picturing that tree?,chandler
43363," I am, yes.",ross
43364," Where you going, Joe?",chandler
43365, For a walk.,joey
43366, Oh. You mind if I join you?,chandler
43367," Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.",joey
43368, Your thoughts? Plural?,chandler
43369," Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!",joey
43370," I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.",chandler
43371," Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?",joey
43372," Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.",chandler
43373, Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.,joey
43374, Great novels?,chandler
43375, Fine ... mediocre p0rn,joey
43376," Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone!  Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son ",rachel
43377," Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.",rachel
43378, If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?,rachel
43379," Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you ""momma's boy"", starting right now.",rachel
43380, Hey Rach!,monica

43384, Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?,monica
43385," Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.",rachel
43386, Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!,rachel
43387, You were just being so nice to him!,monica
43388, I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?,rachel
43389," Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!",rachel
43390, Right there! That was so fake!,monica
43391, Shh!,rachel
43392,"  I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.",rachel
43393," Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.",monica
43394," God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.",rachel
43395, Does he?,monica
43396, What?,rachel
43397, Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?,monica
43398," Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.",rachel
43399," Oh, ok, thank you.   Do you see what all the guys see in her?",rachel
43400, Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! ,monica
43401," Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?",joey

43407," Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?",rachel
43408, So this is what a stroke feels like.,monica
43409," I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.",phoebe
43410, Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?,rachel
43411," No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.",phoebe
43412," whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?",rachel
43413," Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help. ",phoebe
43414, Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.,ross
43415,"  I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.",chandler
43416, We have to stop them before something happens!,ross
43417,"  Right behind you, big guy! ",chandler
43418," So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.",joey
43419," Oh, I didn't go to college.",joey
43420, Molly ... people don't study acting ...,joey
43421," Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?",ross
43422, Thanx.,ross
43423,  Will the stable boy never get the princess??,joey
43424," What do you think you're gonna do, have s*x with her right here on my couch?",ross
43425," No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real?  Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.",joey
43426, Ok ,joey
43427," Yeah, come on in. Molly?",ross
43428," Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem.",ross
43429," It's like my favorite fairy tale come true!  The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!",joey
43430," Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.",phoebe
43431," Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.",phoebe
43432, Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.,phoebe
43433," No.  wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ...  That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?",phoebe
43434," Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.",phoebe
43435, You must think I'm crazy.,phoebe
43436," Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up.  I haven't told you about that yet, have I?",phoebe
43437, Hey!,monica
43438," Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?",rachel

43448," Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card . ""From Gavin""",rachel
43449,"  Awww, awww, it's beautiful.",rachel
43450," See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?",rachel
43451, Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.,rachel
43452, You do?,rachel
43453," See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ...  and you do that ... ",rachel

43468, OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.,ross
43469, Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said,chandler
43470," Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,",ross
43471, So are you gonna...talk to her?,chandler
43472," Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!",ross
43473," You know when ""That's fine"" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!",chandler
43474, No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know,ross
43475, No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?,chandler
43476, I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.,ross
43477," Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!",chandler
43478," Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental",ross

43494," But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out",phoebe
43495," It's just, I'm not good at singing.",monica
43496, Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?,phoebe
43497," No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!",monica
43498, OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.,phoebe

43508, Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?,monica
43509," It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.",phoebe
43510, Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?,monica
43511," You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...",rachel
43512, I thought you hated him?,monica
43513," You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!",rachel
43514, So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?,monica
43515," I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't",rachel
43516," Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross",monica
43517, Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...,rachel
43518," Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!",phoebe

43527, Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.,ross
43528," Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,",chandler
43529, That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?,ross
43530, What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!,chandler
43531, I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me,ross
43532," Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing",chandler
43533," No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.",ross
43534, Did she go out with him?,chandler
43535," No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.",ross

43581," I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed",chandler

43655, We’ll see.,ross

43657," I don’t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?",ross
43658, How do you know about that?,rachel
43659," Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...",ross
43660," When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?",ross
43661," Oh, that’s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?",rachel
43662," Ok, Michelle, it’s time to go.",ross

43677, Why didn’t I get that message?,rachel
43678, What?,ross
43679," From the guy in the bar, why didn’t I get that message?",rachel
43680, Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?,ross
43681, Ross?,rachel
43682, I never gave it to you.,ross
43683, Why?,rachel
43684, I don’t know.,ross

43690, None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That’s not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one,ross
43691," Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What’s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they",rachel
43692," Uh, clearly.",ross
43693," And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,",rachel

43706," Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?",ross
43707," Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...",rachel
43708, She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.,joey
43709, Bye!,rachel
43710," Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.",ross
43711," No, hey, it's been great.",joey
43712, Yeah?,ross
43713," Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...",joey
43714," Yeah, that'll do it.",ross
43715," Wow! So, how are you?",joey
43716," I'm, I'm okay. ",ross
43717, Really?,joey
43718," Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.",ross
43719," Well, actually it...",joey
43720," No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.",ross
43721," Wow, really?",joey
43722," Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...",ross

43730," I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.",joey
43731," Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.",phoebe
43732, Why are they doing this?,joey
43733, I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.,phoebe
43734," You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?",joey
43735, I just wish they'd realise they should be together.,phoebe
43736," I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.",joey
43737, I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.,phoebe
43738," Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.",joey
43739," You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.",phoebe
43740," Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.",joey
43741," So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?",phoebe
43742, I know; that just pushes them further and further apart. ,joey
43743," Yeah.  Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.",phoebe
43744," Ooh, that's a great plan! ",joey
43745," Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my ""plan-laugh."" ",phoebe
43746," Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...",joey
43747, Hey!,rachel
43748, Hey!,monica
43749," You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?",rachel
43750," See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.",chandler
43751, I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.,rachel
43752," Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?",monica
43753," Well, Phoebe set me up on a date. ",rachel

43757," Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...",monica
43758," What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.",rachel
43759," Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!",chandler
43760," You want a job? Turn off ""Oprah,"" and send out a resume!",monica
43761, So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?,rachel
43762," Oh, it's perfect.",monica
43763," Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!",rachel
43764," Ooh, Joey. ",phoebe
43765, Hey.,joey
43766, Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight. ,phoebe
43767, All right! Who is he?,joey
43768," Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.",phoebe
43769," Oh, yeah.",phoebe
43770, She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher! ,joey
43771, A teacher?,phoebe
43772," Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?",joey
43773," Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman! ",phoebe
43774," Oh my god, you're right! ",joey
43775, Yeah.,phoebe
43776, She even reads for pleasure!,joey
43777, How do you even know a woman like that?,phoebe
43778, What? I'm not allowed to know smart women? ,joey
43779, Joey.,phoebe
43780, I met her at the library. I went in to pee.,joey
43781, So now what do we do?,phoebe
43782," Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.",joey
43783," What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!",phoebe
43784, Ooh...I hear that's bad. ,joey
43785," Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.",phoebe
43786," Ah, yes, The Plan! ",joey
43787," It's not Santa's plan. No, it's... ",phoebe
43788," Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.",joey
43789," No, I think we killed it.",phoebe
43790," Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.",chandler
43791," No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!",chandler
43792," Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.",monica
43793, I don't do that.,chandler
43794," I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?",chandler
43795, Yeah.,monica
43796, Today is the sixth.,chandler
43797," No, it's not.",monica
43798," Yes, it's also 2003.",chandler
43799, Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.,monica
43800, It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.,chandler
43801, Okay.,monica
43802, Tough crib.,chandler
43803," Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.",monica
43804, I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.,chandler
43805, Chandler!,monica
43806, I am not working. There's not much to do around here!,chandler
43807," Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?",ross
43808," Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.",ross
43809," Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.",ross
43810," Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.",ross
43811, No! ,ross
43812, We're okay. I'm still ovulating.,monica
43813," Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not. ",chandler
43814," So, let's do this.",monica
43815, I - I don't think I can.,chandler
43816," Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.",monica
43817, Because of Emma.,chandler
43818," Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.",monica
43819, Sorry.,chandler
43820," Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?",monica
43821," Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.",chandler
43822, Canoodling?,monica
43823," Well, I can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front of the B-A-B-Y.",chandler
43824," I don't know. I mean, I guess having s*x in front of a baby isn't so...",monica
43825, Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?,chandler
43826, I guess you're right.,monica
43827," You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have s*x with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.",chandler
43828, But what kind of a sick b*st*rd wants to do it in front of a deer?,monica
43829," Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.",rachel
43830," Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.",rachel
43831, What?,rachel
43832," Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.",rachel
43833, Really? What's that like?,rachel
43834, Really? ,rachel
43835, Hello?,phoebe
43836," Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!",rachel
43837," Hey, Rach!",phoebe
43838, This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?,rachel
43839," You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends. ",phoebe
43840, I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!,rachel
43841," Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.",phoebe
43842, He's not stoned.,rachel
43843, Did he go out for a cigarette? ,phoebe
43844," Yeah, four times.",rachel
43845," My dear, sweet Rach.",phoebe
43846," Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.",joey
43847," By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico.  Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.",phoebe
43848, She's asleep. Chandler?,monica
43849, What are you doing?,monica
43850, Emma was doing it!,chandler
43851, She's asleep.,monica

43853," Yes, but we have to be fast.",monica
43854, Hello?,joey
43855, Emma? Hey! Hi!,joey
43856," How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?",joey
43857," You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!",joey
43858," Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.",ross
43859," Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have s*x tonight.",ross
43860, Just the crab cakes.,ross
43861, What's - what's going on?,ross
43862, What? You - you're making money off my misery?,ross
43863," This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.",ross
43864," Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.",monica
43865, I think we may have really done it this time.,chandler
43866," Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.",monica
43867, You may wanna get some more of those too.,chandler
43868, Where's Emma?,chandler
43869," Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?",monica
43870," Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!",chandler
43871," Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.",monica
43872, Okay. ,chandler
43873," Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.",monica
43874," No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.",rachel
43875, Don't touch my coat!,rachel
43876," Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?",rachel
43877," Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!",rachel
43878," Hey, did you stop by here?",monica
43879, No.,rachel
43880," Oh my god, then...",monica
43881," Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!",monica
43882," What? What do you mean, ""there you are""? Where was she?",rachel
43883," Oh, we were playing ""peek-a-boo."" She just – she loves it when I'm dramatic.",monica
43884, Because you two were having s*x!,joey
43885," No, we weren't!",monica
43886, Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair.  You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?,joey
43887," All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.",chandler
43888, Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have s*x with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this. ,joey
43889," No, no, no.",chandler
43890," No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!",monica
43891," Hey, I gotta! Unless...",joey
43892, Unless what?,monica
43893, Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.,joey
43894, What? Why?,chandler
43895," Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.",joey
43896, Your family name is Tribbiani.,chandler
43897,   You almost had me.,joey
43898," Well, uh...",rachel
43899," Really, really not.",rachel
43900," All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.",rachel
43901," Hey, what's wrong?",ross
43902, I just had a rough night.,rachel
43903, Oh. Crab cake?,ross
43904, Eww!,rachel
43905," Well, what happened?",ross
43906," Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...",rachel
43907, Monica told me you had a blind date.,ross
43908, Yeah.,rachel
43909," I did, too.",ross
43910, Oh.,rachel
43911, But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?,ross
43912," Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?",rachel
43913, Why does everyone keep saying that?,ross
43914," Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.",rachel
43915, That bad?,ross
43916," Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.",rachel
43917, Female body inspector? What size is that?,ross
43918," Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?",phoebe
43919, Uh-huh.,joey
43920, How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?,phoebe
43921," It's easy, you just walk in on them having s*x.",joey
43922," Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.",phoebe
43923," Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.",phoebe
43924," Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.",phoebe
43925," The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.",ross
43926," Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.",rachel
43927," Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.",ross
43928," We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.",joey
43929," Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.",phoebe
43930," Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!",phoebe
43931, Where?,joey
43932, Mexico!,phoebe
43933, Can you believe they're still not here?,joey
43934," I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?",ross
43935," I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?",joey
43936, We've been stood up.  And we want our free crab cakes.,joey
43937,"  Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what…",chandler

43944," Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.",chandler
43945," Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'. ",joey
43946," Right. So, it'll be the same except… less s*x with you. ",chandler
43947," So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?",ross
43948," Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.",chandler
43949,  That's great.,phoebe
43950," Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating ",chandler
43951,  Humiliating and noble!,chandler
43952," You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.",ross
43953," Ross, you did not come up with ""got milk?""",monica

43971," Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word. ",joey
43972," Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it…",rachel

44018," Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up…",phoebe
44019," Hey, how did the audition go? ",monica
44020," Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me.  ",joey
44021, What happened?,monica
44022," Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.",joey
44023, So far so good! ,monica
44024,"  Honey, I'm old!",chandler
44025,  What's wrong?,monica
44026, I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.,chandler
44027, So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.,monica
44028," Yes, but I don't think life experience with these. ",chandler
44029, Wooooooooow  It's like they're on fire!,joey
44030, What are they? ,monica
44031, They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.,chandler
44032,  I give you $ 500 for them!,joey
44033, What am I supposed to do with these?,chandler
44034," Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.",monica
44035," Well, first of all, they're not called ""sneakers"" anymore. Apparently, they're called ""kicks"" or ""skids"" and I think I heard somebody say ""slorps"".  And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity!  Would you help me try to sell these?",chandler
44036," Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers? ",monica
44037," No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for. ",chandler
44038," Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords? ",joey
44039," Hey, you'll never guess what just happened… Phoebe and I got mugged!",ross
44040, You okay?!,monica
44041,"  Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger! ",ross
44042,  How do you know a mugger?,monica
44043, I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us. ,phoebe
44044, You wanna know how she knew him?  Because Phoebe used to mug people. ,ross
44045,  Seriously?,monica
44046," Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know… sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I…",phoebe
44047,"  Phoebe, that is awful!",monica
44048," Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony… I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer…",phoebe
44049, You're mother killed herself!,monica
44050, She was a drug dealer!,phoebe
44051," Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because  I was about to do some serious damage! ",ross
44052,  Okay…,phoebe
44053," Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.",monica
44054, Why?,phoebe
44055," Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.",monica
44056,  You were?,phoebe
44057," Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics… you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble got into that week- ",ross
44058,  Wonderwoman!,monica
44059," Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone…  … when outta nowhere this *** with a pipe jumps out and says: ""Gimme your money, punk!""",ross
44060,  Oh my god…,phoebe
44061," I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: ""Science Boy""",ross
44062, Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?,monica
44063, A superhuman thirst for knowledge.,ross
44064, That's it. ,monica
44065," Well, I-I better get to class  Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?",ross
44066," No… actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street… that's where stabby Joe works. ",phoebe
44067," Okay, I think we have a problem here. ",phoebe
44068, What?,monica
44069," Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics. ",phoebe
44070, Yeah?,monica
44071," Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat. ",phoebe
44072, So?,monica
44073," Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-",phoebe
44074, Oh my god!,monica
44075, I know… I mugged Ross! ,phoebe
44076,"  I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?",joey

44086, Hey!,monica
44087, Hey!,chandler
44088, What are you doing?,monica
44089," Putting on the sneakers… thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything…",chandler
44090," Oh, anything yet?",rachel
44091," Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!",chandler
44092,  Hey!,joey
44093, Probably wanna know what I'm doing…?,joey
44094," No, that seems about right.",monica
44095," Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!",joey
44096," Joey, that was formula.",rachel
44097, We gotta get more of that. ,joey
44098,  You know what… these aren't half-bad!  You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.,chandler
44099," Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph. ",rachel
44100, Alright  I feel younger already! ,chandler
44101,"  Yah, I think I broke my hip.",chandler
44102,"  Hey, you!",phoebe

44106," Nothing, I really wanna know.",phoebe
44107," Oh…  Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene…",ross
44108,"  Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make… uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid…",phoebe
44109,  Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.,ross
44110," You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.",phoebe
44111," No, it wasn't.",ross
44112," Yes, it was. ",phoebe
44113," No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old…",ross
44114,"  ""Gimme your money, punk!""",phoebe
44115,"  Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you… you mugged me? ",ross
44116,"  Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat.  I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have… have a great one! ",phoebe
44117, It's not the best!,ross
44118," I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say…",phoebe
44119,  There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. ,ross
44120, Really? Even more humiliating than…,phoebe
44121,"  Hey, let's not do this! ",ross
44122, Okay…  You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age…,chandler
44123," A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: ""Not suitable for adults!"" ",chandler
44124," Oh, thank you, sir… or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me ",chandler
44125,"  I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.",chandler
44126, The cold weather hurts my hip!,chandler
44127," Hey, Ross!  I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second? ",phoebe
44128," Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead. ",ross
44129, I just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting. ,phoebe
44130,"  Oh my god, crap from the street?  ",ross
44131," Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell… or smoke.  Anyway, I was looking through it and I found ""Science Boy"" ",phoebe
44132, Oh my god.  I never thought I'd see this again.  It's all here. What made you save it all these years? ,ross
44133," I can't say, I just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day. ",phoebe
44134," You really thought ""Science Boy"" was worth saving! ",ross
44135," Yeah… but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here. ",phoebe
44136," Still… this is amazing… Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe. ",ross
44137," You're welcome. And thank you for ""Science Boy"". I learned a lot from him ",phoebe
44138, You're welcome. ,ross
44139,"  ""I need an answer!""",joey
44140," ""You know!""",joey
44141," ""I need an answer now!"" ",joey
44142,  Oh!,joey
44143," ""You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for – Bang – End Scene!""",joey
44144,"  Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get…",joey
44145," Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering p0rn… on a Saturday afternoon?!  I was in the house! ",monica
44146,"  Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that…",ross
44147, … that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah. ,monica
44148, I see. You didn't happen to tell…,ross
44149, … everybody we know? Yeah.,monica
44150, Great. Thanks! ,ross
44151, Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?,chandler
44152, I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?,monica
44153," I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.",chandler
44154," I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.",monica
44155, Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.,chandler
44156," Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.",monica
44157, You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?,chandler
44158, Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.,monica
44159, No! We're not borrowing money.,chandler
44160, Why not?,monica
44161, Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.,chandler
44162, Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.,monica
44163, That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.,chandler
44164, Why??,phoebe
44165," Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.",phoebe

44171," Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together!  Oh god, we're really going to move in together!",phoebe
44172," I've always wanted to live with a guy. ""Pick up your socks!"" ""Put down the toilet seat!"" ""No! We're not having s*x anymore!"" It's gonna be fun!",phoebe
44173, Hey Joey!,monica
44174, Hey!,joey
44175," Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.",monica
44176," I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong.",joey
44177,  Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.,monica
44178," Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.",joey
44179, But Chandler lent you money!,monica
44180, And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.,joey
44181, Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.,monica
44182, Oh...how much?,joey
44183, Two thousand dollars?,monica

44190," Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. ""Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!"" or er.. ""Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!"" Huh!",joey
44191," Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?",monica
44192, No. I was just going to do this myself. ,rachel
44193, You're gonna do it?,joey
44194," Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?",rachel
44195," Oh, women can. You can't.",joey
44196, Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?,rachel

44204, Yeah.... she's not so cute.,chandler
44205," Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.",phoebe
44206, Is that a bit you guys do?,monica

44222, Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.,chandler
44223, I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.,joey

44272, Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.,monica
44273, No you really think that's what it is?,rachel
44274," You heard him! ""No bigger!"" ""You're perfect!"" ""Just don't get any bigger!"" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.",monica
44275," Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control.  God! It's just such a magical time!",rachel

44285," wow, are you still going to move in with him?",ross
44286," I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!",phoebe
44287," Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.",ross
44288, That's not how you really feel is it?,phoebe
44289," No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.",ross
44290, Seriously? You divorce-o?,phoebe
44291," If you have to call me name, I prefer ""Ross the Divorcer"". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.",ross
44292, It's ok that's how you feel.,phoebe

44318,  What?,chandler
44319, Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?,rachel
44320, Because she is!,joey
44321," Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.",monica

44323, OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?,joey
44324," Hey! What do you guys think about this. ""Ross: The Divorce-Force"".",ross
44325, Better.,phoebe
44326," Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.",ross
44327," Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.",phoebe
44328," Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.",ross
44329, What do you mean?,phoebe
44330," Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?",ross
44331, They are awfully boxy...,phoebe
44332, I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.,ross
44333, Uh huh.,phoebe
44334," Hey hey, can I help?",ross
44335," Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.",chandler

44337," Hey uh, where do you guys want this?",joey

44341,  Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?,joey
44342, Someday.,phoebe
44343, Aaaaand....... hernia.,chandler
44344, I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.,phoebe
44345," Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.",phoebe
44346," But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.",phoebe
44347, Are you gonna change yours?,phoebe
44348, Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.,phoebe
44349, I don't want it to end either.,phoebe
44350, Yeah.,phoebe
44351, I'm so sorry Pheebs.,rachel

44360," Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .",chandler
44361, It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?,ross
44362, The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?,chandler
44363," Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...",ross
44364, Bet she'd sleep with you now...,chandler
44365, No... I already e-mailed her.,ross
44366," Let me see what you wrote about yourself: ""Doctor Paleontology, two kids... ""  You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!",chandler
44367," You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.",ross
44368, Hey! ,joey
44369,  What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? ,ross
44370," Maybe we finish this for him!  ""Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best s*x I've ever had""... aaand SEND!",chandler

44379, Chandler... hey...  Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? ,joey
44380," She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?",rachel
44381,"  Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!",joey
44382," Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!",rachel
44383," Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...",joey
44384," All right... Oh, Emma loves him!",rachel
44385, Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!,joey
44386, Hi.,phoebe
44387, Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?,monica
44388," Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!",phoebe
44389," Oh, I'm so sorry!",chandler
44390," Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!!  Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...",phoebe
44391, You're not gonna need my help?,chandler
44392," Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.",phoebe
44393," Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth ",chandler
44394," Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.",phoebe
44395," Ok, you got it!",monica
44396,"  Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.",phoebe
44397, Really? If that's what you want...,monica
44398, That was a test and you just failed.,phoebe
44399, Damn it! Rookie mistake!,monica
44400,  I have s*x with dinosaurs??,ross
44401, I believe I read that somewhere!,chandler
44402," That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...  It's not funny!!",ross
44403, I respectfully disagree.,chandler
44404, I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!,ross
44405, Who cares? Nobody reads those things,chandler
44406, You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.,ross
44407, I don't have a page.,chandler
44408, Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!,ross
44409," Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.  It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. ",joey
44410," : Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!",rachel
44411," It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.",joey
44412, What are you doing?,rachel
44413," Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.",joey
44414," Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.",rachel
44415,  There you go sweetie...  This isn't over.,joey
44416," Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  ""gay as the day is long""?",monica
44417, Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.,chandler
44418, But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. ,monica
44419, Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.,chandler
44420,"  Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.",monica
44421," Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie!  I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go .",chandler
44422, What are you doing?,monica
44423," Oh, you'll see my friend.",chandler
44424,  I'm dead?,ross
44425,  And so young.,chandler
44426, Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.,ross
44427," Well, how you died was funny.",chandler
44428," Oh please, hit by a blimp?",ross
44429, It kills over one americans every year.,chandler
44430," Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.",ross
44431, You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!,chandler
44432," You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay p0rn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.",ross
44433," God, I wish Mike were here.",phoebe
44434, Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?,monica
44435," What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!",monica
44436," I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.",phoebe
44437," Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want.  Give me your phone.",monica
44438, Here.,phoebe
44439, And now your cell.,monica
44440, Okay ,phoebe
44441, This is your cellphone?,monica
44442, Yes.,phoebe
44443, This is your current cellphone?,monica
44444," Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.",phoebe
44445," Phoebe, where's your purse?",monica
44446," No, no! Give it to me!",monica
44447, You can't have it.,phoebe
44448, Give it to me!,monica
44449, No ,phoebe
44450, I'll go in there.,monica
44451,  Oh yeah.,phoebe
44452, Phoebe come here,monica
44453, Haha!,monica
44454, Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!,phoebe
44455," Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.",joey
44456," Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.",rachel
44457," No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!",joey
44458," Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.",rachel
44459," No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.",joey
44460," Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...",rachel
44461, Make the transfer! ,joey
44462, Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?,rachel
44463," Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.",joey
44464," Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.",rachel
44465, But he's the same.,joey
44466," Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.",rachel
44467, But he's the same.,joey
44468," Joey, come on!",rachel
44469, He's the same!,joey
44470,  You're not the same!,joey
44471, Haha!,monica
44472," You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.",phoebe
44473," So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.",monica
44474, Those are my shoes.,phoebe
44475," Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.",monica
44476," Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.",phoebe
44477, Who's that? ,monica
44478, I ordered Chinese food.,phoebe
44479, What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?,phoebe
44480,  What are you doing here?,monica
44481, Phoebe!,monica
44482," I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.",phoebe
44483, Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?,monica
44484, There is a speakerphone on the base unit...,phoebe
44485, Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!,monica
44486,  This doesn't concern you!!,monica
44487," Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.",monica
44488, Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?,phoebe
44489," Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend  and Mike's friend .",monica
44490, Sit down.,phoebe
44491, Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! ,monica
44492, I've been pretty good!,monica
44493," Thanks, you look good too.",phoebe
44494, Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!,monica
44495, So how's the piano playing going?,phoebe
44496, I've missed you too.,phoebe
44497," You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!",monica
44498," Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?",chandler
44499," uhu uhu, check this out. ",ross
44500, Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?,chandler
44501," Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little ""Ross is dead"" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead.  Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?",ross
44502," No, come on, you know that's not true.",chandler
44503, What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!,ross
44504," Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.",chandler
44505, I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! ,ross
44506," Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.",chandler
44507, You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.,ross
44508," Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.",chandler
44509, Exactly!! ,ross
44510," Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?",chandler
44511, No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!,ross
44512," Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !",chandler
44513," oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...",ross
44514," I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?",rachel
44515, Original or crappy?,joey
44516, Original.,rachel
44517," No, sorry haven't seen him.",joey
44518, Then what's that big lump under your covers?,rachel
44519," It's Monica, ok?",joey
44520, That's not Monica!,rachel
44521," Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..",joey
44522,  Oh God.,rachel
44523, ... she's being unreasonable!,joey
44524,"  Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much  Oh don't cover its ears!  It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!",rachel
44525, It does?,joey
44526, Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.,rachel
44527, Really? She... she loves me?,joey
44528," Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever .",rachel
44529," Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.",joey
44530," Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up.  Look Emma, look who's baaack!",rachel
44531, Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.,joey
44532, Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?,rachel
44533, How do you think I got him in the first place?,joey
44534," Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.",monica
44535," I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?",phoebe
44536,"  Kiss him, you fool!!",monica
44537, What?,phoebe
44538, Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!,monica
44539," Oh, I missed you so much! ",phoebe
44540, Who is this?,phoebe
44541," Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!",monica
44542, Excuse me?,monica
44543," Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.",monica
44544, You didn't hear the speech!,monica
44545," Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!",monica
44546, You're... weird!,monica
44547, Oh !,monica
44548, Damn it!,monica
44549, And I blame you too.,monica
44550," It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!",ross
44551, There you go! Someone came!,chandler
44552," Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! ",ross
44553," Hi, glad you could come.",monica
44554,"  Please, come in.",chandler
44555," Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.",chandler
44556, At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps ,chandler
44557, Who is he?,ross
44558," Some guy, Tom Gordon.",chandler
44559," I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives. ",ross
44560," So, did you know Ross well?",monica
44561,"  Yes, he is. Me.",monica
44562,"  Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!! ",chandler
44563, Ok! ,chandler
44564,  I'm dead and no one cares?,ross
44565, I look like a man??,monica
44566," Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!",chandler
44567," It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!",ross
44568," You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!",chandler
44569," Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?",ross
44570," Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?",chandler
44571,  Yeah...,ross
44572," I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. ",chandler

44576, You are married though.,monica
44577," Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! ",chandler
44578, I didn't know Ross and you were so close.,chandler
44579," I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.",chandler
44580,"  But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!",ross
44581, Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!,ross
44582,"  No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok?  Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless.  Monica?",ross
44583," Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?",joey
44584, Ok.,monica

44590, Very good!  What do you need it for anyway?,monica
44591," Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...",joey
44592, Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?,rachel
44593, Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.,joey
44594," Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!",monica
44595, Uh!,joey
44596," Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.",monica
44597," Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!",chandler
44598, Hey will you get me tickets too?,phoebe
44599," Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!",rachel
44600, No thanks!,ross
44601, You don't wanna win the lottery?,phoebe
44602," Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.",ross
44603, Still on Amelia Earhart?,chandler
44604, The woman just vanished!,ross
44605," Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?",joey
44606, No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.,ross
44607, Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.,chandler
44608, I like those odds!,joey
44609," Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.",ross
44610, I'll ask.  Boohaki?,chandler
44611," Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.",ross
44612," Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.",rachel
44613, How do you know she's gonna start talking?,monica
44614, Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.,rachel
44615, Kinda like Joey.,chandler
44616, What's that now?,joey
44617, God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.,monica
44618, Pie eating contest?,chandler
44619, Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?,monica
44620," No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.",chandler
44621, That was a good day!,monica
44622," They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!",ross

44630, She dropped off a casserole?,rachel
44631, Oh yeah! The casserole lady.,joey
44632," So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?",monica
44633," Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!",ross
44634," Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!! ",chandler
44635, Think he washed his hands?,ross
44636," Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?",chandler
44637, What's going on?,rachel
44638," Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.",monica
44639, Ooh! Tough odds!,joey
44640, Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!,ross
44641, Look who's coming around!,joey
44642, Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.,chandler

44651," Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!",phoebe
44652," Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.",monica
44653, A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!,ross
44654," Alright, who wants to do it?",monica
44655," Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!",phoebe
44656," Ok, hey Rach?",monica
44657," Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.",rachel
44658, I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.,joey
44659, I hope I win!,phoebe
44660," Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?",monica
44661, I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!,joey
44662," Right! .. but we ""know"" what you're wishing for!",monica
44663, Can't really say!,joey
44664," I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?",monica
44665, I'm not really comfortable with these questions!,joey
44666," One, two, three!",phoebe
44667," I won, hey!",joey
44668," You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp!  Ah!! That thing gets hot!!",ross
44669," You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?",rachel
44670," Uh, you're not gonna win.",ross
44671," Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like ""oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape"" and you're gonna be all like ""oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai""",rachel
44672," Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.",ross
44673," I can see the headline now: ""Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm"".",chandler
44674, Why would I eat my own arm?,ross
44675," Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.",chandler
44676," You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.",monica
44677, Why?,ross
44678," Because I know that you think the lottery is ""boohaki"" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.",monica
44679," You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here ",ross
44680, Get a room!,phoebe
44681," Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?",chandler
44682," I don't know, probably just invest it.",ross
44683, Ooh! Calm down ...,chandler
44684," Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?",joey
44685," Oh, I'm sorry, did I say ""invest it""? I meant ""be cool and piss it all away"" ",ross
44686," Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!",joey
44687, I don't really care about the Knicks.,rachel
44688," Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.",joey
44689,  You would do that? I never get picked!,rachel
44690," You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.",chandler
44691, You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!,joey
44692," You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.",chandler
44693,"  Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?",ross
44694,  I'll take this one too  Uh ... Mommy?,chandler
44695," Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel ""Mommy"" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...",ross
44696, I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.,rachel
44697," Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me ""Daddy"" too.",ross
44698," Oooh, I like that, ""daddy"" ",phoebe
44699, I ... I was just talking about Rachel.,ross
44700,"  Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?",phoebe
44701,  Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi ..  no I can't.,ross
44702," Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye. ",chandler
44703," Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?",joey
44704," Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.",chandler
44705," Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!",monica
44706, He's the boss's son.,chandler
44707," Come on, lottery!! ",monica
44708," Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.",rachel
44709," Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this?  Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.",monica
44710," Ooh, I have another idea!",rachel
44711," I'm sorry, idea time is over.",monica
44712," Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?",phoebe
44713, Yeah.,monica

44719," Chandler, sense the tone!!",monica
44720," Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!",rachel
44721," Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.",monica
44722, Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.,phoebe
44723," I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!",ross
44724," Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!",monica
44725, 3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...,ross
44726," I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?",joey
44727, When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!,monica
44728,  I'll show you how.,joey
44729," Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your ""special"" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?",rachel
44730," Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!",monica
44731," Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?",rachel
44732,"  She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...",chandler
44733, Ahhh! ,monica
44734," Let me finish ...  however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! ",chandler
44735, There's the man I married!!,monica
44736," All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!",rachel
44737," Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!",monica
44738,"  OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets !",rachel
44739," Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!",joey
44740," Than I want mine, too ! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.",ross
44741," Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together ",phoebe
44742," No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!",monica
44743," Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea! ",joey
44744," Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!",chandler
44745," Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up! ",rachel
44746,  Oh!,joey
44747,  OOOOOHHHHH!,phoebe
44748,"  Hey, hey!!",ross
44749,"  OOOOOHHHHH!  Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! ",phoebe
44750," Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.",rachel

44753, Don't come any closer!,phoebe
44754," Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...",chandler
44755," No, what's more important, your friends or money?",phoebe
44756, Money!  Friends...,monica
44757," Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?",phoebe
44758, They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...,monica
44759, Monica!,ross
44760," Ok, good!  You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this... Oh God, no!  I think I broke your bowl.",phoebe
44761," Go, go, go!!",ross
44762," What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.",phoebe
44763," Phoebe, we lost half of them.",monica
44764," So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?",phoebe
44765, Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...,ross
44766," As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die.  So, excuse me for being a little skittish.",phoebe
44767,"  Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!",chandler
44768," Oh, play them!",monica
44769," Ok, here we go! ",chandler
44770," Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.",phoebe
44771, This is..shhh!,chandler
44772," Oh God, I am so sorry honey...",monica
44773," Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.",rachel

44775," No, she was just much better at job than me!",rachel
44776," Guys, the drawing is about to start!",phoebe

44778," Oh yeah, it's a good idea!",ross
44779,"  Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.",monica
44780," Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.  But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?",chandler
44781,  131! ,monica

44787," We are on a roll, people!!",monica
44788,  Come on!!,ross

44969," Dude, none of this is cool.",chandler
44970," No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes.  Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt  I wish I'd thought this through.",ross

44990, Olivia.,rachel
44991," Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor!  Oh right, real life more important.",monica
44992, So do you think that my dream means anything?,rachel

44994, Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...,rachel
44995," Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.",monica

45001," Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.",phoebe

45004," Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...",rachel

45006," Ok, we're still on that.",rachel
45007, I didn't say your songs were not good enough.,monica
45008, Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?,phoebe
45009, Tiny portions?,monica
45010," Yeah well, ""excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but  I can't see it, I can't see it""!",phoebe
45011," Phoebe, it's not about quantity.",monica
45012, Well...it's not about quality.,phoebe
45013," Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.",monica
45014," Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.",phoebe

45016," Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?",phoebe
45017," You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.",monica

45039,"  Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? ",monica
45040," Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside?  Ha!",phoebe
45041," Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .",monica
45042," Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?",phoebe
45043, Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? ,monica
45044," Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .",phoebe
45045, Excuse us!  Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? ,monica
45046, Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! ,phoebe
45047, I'm sorry...,monica
45048, I'm sorry too... ,phoebe
45049, ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?,monica
45050, Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...,phoebe

45065," Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...",joey
45066," Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?",rachel
45067," A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.",joey
45068, So?,rachel
45069, So...I've never played that!,joey
45070," Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?",rachel
45071, Uh...well...just once...with you...,joey
45072, Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?,rachel
45073,  What the hell are you talking about??,joey
45074,"  Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.",rachel
45075,"  Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.",joey
45076,"  Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...",rachel
45077," Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful...  and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.",joey
45078,  Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! ,joey

45294, You really liked it?,monica
45295," Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained  not to listen!  But after chapter 16: ""fat, single and ready to mingle"", I was uplifted.",chandler

45301," Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?",phoebe
45302," It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.",ross
45303," Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.",phoebe
45304," Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.",ross

45312, Hey!,monica
45313," I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.",rachel

45332," I missed most of the party  Charlie's a girl, right?",chandler
45333," Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.",ross
45334," I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!",rachel
45335, Why do you care so much?,ross
45336," Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?",monica
45337,  Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women!  I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.,rachel
45338," Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...",ross
45339," Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!",phoebe

45348," Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.",ross
45349," Yeah, I know the type.",ross
45350," Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?",joey
45351,  Hey!,phoebe

45364,"  What's up?  Hey, Rachel!!",phoebe

45367," And she wants to go hunting, too!!",monica
45368," Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!",rachel
45369," Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.",phoebe
45370, I don't care about any of that!!,rachel
45371," Well, do you care about friendship?",phoebe
45372, Oh!,rachel
45373," I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.",phoebe

45384, We really need to take those tests?,chandler
45385," Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.",monica
45386, But I don't wanna do it in a cup!,chandler
45387, What is the big deal?,monica
45388, It's weird! In a doctor's office?,chandler
45389, It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?,monica
45390,"  I cannot believe Ross told you that!  And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!",chandler
45391," Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!",monica

45439," Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.",joey
45440," Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.",ross
45441," Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!",joey
45442, But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...,ross

45444, Ok.,ross
45445, You got to tell me exactly what to do there.,joey

45447," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right ",joey
45448, I have a weird feeling about this place.  How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.,chandler

45474,  Uhm... Stockholm.,phoebe
45475, Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!,rachel
45476,  Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.,joey

45480, Phonetically? ,joey
45481," Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.",ross
45482, Ok.,joey
45483," Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!",ross
45484," Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on ""Days"" I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy"".",joey
45485, Wow. What does that mean?,ross
45486," No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear"".",joey
45487, Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?,ross
45488," Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .",joey
45489," Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.",ross
45490, Come on! you... ,joey

45494, I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.,chandler
45495,"  Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?",chandler
45496,"  oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...",chandler
45497,"  It was a ""Wendy's!! """,chandler
45498,"  ""Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! "" And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! ",phoebe
45499," Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.",rachel
45500," Oh, Ja! Ja!",phoebe
45501, Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... ,rachel
45502," Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?",phoebe
45503, I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...,rachel
45504, Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!,phoebe
45505,  Phoebe!!,rachel
45506, You know it's me?,phoebe
45507," For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!",rachel
45508, How can you come here?,phoebe
45509, How could you not tell me you worked here?,rachel
45510, I don't have to tell you everything!,phoebe
45511," Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!",rachel
45512, Tips not included.,phoebe
45513," Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?",rachel
45514," Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!",phoebe
45515," Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!",rachel
45516, You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!,phoebe

45526,"  Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.",ross
45527, What?,ross
45528," What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.",ross
45529,"  Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.",ross
45530," And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.",ross
45531, That was going to be my next argument.,ross
45532, Hey!,joey
45533, Hey!,ross
45534,  You're ready?,joey
45535,"  Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.",joey
45536, Glad I could help man.,ross
45537," Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but...  I made it work.",joey
45538,  It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.,chandler
45539," Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly.  No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this?  Oh.  Well, so what does that mean?  Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. ",chandler
45540, Hey sweetie.,monica
45541, Doctor Connelly just called.,chandler
45542," With good news?  Of course it is not good news, you just said  ""Doctor Connelly just called"". If it was good news you would have said  ""Doctor Connelly just called! "" But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?",monica
45543, Actually it's both of us.,chandler
45544, What?,monica
45545, Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.,chandler
45546, Oh... what does that mean?,monica
45547, It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  It means...,chandler
45548, Chandler?,monica
45549,"  It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.",chandler
45550,  Oh my God!,monica
45551, I'm sorry.,chandler
45552, I'm sorry too.,monica
45553," Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.",chandler

45558,"  Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live s*x show!",rachel
45559," Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.",rachel
45560," Yeah, yeah... It's... ""climax your way to better skin"".",rachel
45561," So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.",joey
45562,"  Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!",rachel
45563, Oh hey Rach!,joey
45564, Yeah...,rachel
45565, Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.,joey
45566," Oh, well...",rachel
45567," Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.",joey
45568," Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!",rachel
45569,"  Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!",joey
45570,"  Ok, great! All right, bye!  Pain in the ass!!  That's off, right?",phoebe
45571," What's the matter, Pheebs?",joey
45572," Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like ""Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!"". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!",phoebe
45573," Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!",rachel
45574, Exactly!,phoebe
45575, And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!,rachel
45576,"  I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh, sexual politics!!",phoebe
45577," Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.",rachel
45578," Ok, that'll be great!",phoebe
45579," Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.",joey
45580, That's not what we're gonna do!,rachel
45581," Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?",joey
45582,  Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!,chandler
45583," Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!",monica
45584," Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!",chandler
45585, Hi.,chandler
45586, Hi.,monica
45587, Ok.,monica
45588," Oh, DAMN IT!",chandler
45589," Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",monica
45590,  Ok.,monica
45591," Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!  Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!",chandler
45592," Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?",rachel
45593,"  Alright, have a good time. ",joey
45594, Not gonna find any clothes in there!,rachel
45595,"  Hey, you guys!",ross
45596, Hi.,rachel
45597, Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?,ross
45598," Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  Well, why are you laughing?",ross
45599," Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!",joey
45600," Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.",ross
45601," Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.",ross
45602," Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?",rachel
45603, Tsz... NO! .,ross
45604,  Hey guys!,chandler
45605," Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.",ross
45606," I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.",chandler
45607, It's in Barbados.,ross
45608, But you come first!,chandler
45609, I'm there!,rachel
45610, Bye.,joey
45611," Bye, see ya. ",rachel
45612,  Ok.,chandler
45613," All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?",joey
45614, Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get p0rn if you're giving a sperm sample.,chandler
45615, So-so what did the doctor say?,ross
45616," Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.",chandler
45617, So you're ruling out surrogacy?,joey
45618, Yeah.,chandler
45619," So, I don't have to learn what that means?",joey
45620," Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.",chandler
45621," Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?",joey
45622,  ah-ha!,chandler
45623, How do you feel about all this?,ross
45624, I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.,chandler
45625," Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!",joey
45626,  What?,ross
45627,  What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!,ross
45628, The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.,ross
45629,"  I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash.  So-so what I am saying is - is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!",ross
45630," Oh, that's not what you want...",ross
45631," Oh, I'll take some of that.",phoebe
45632," Pheebs, that's for men!",rachel
45633," No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy.  Yeah.",phoebe
45634," Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!",phoebe
45635," On Melanie Griffith in ""Working girl"". I think what you want is over here.",rachel
45636, Really?,rachel
45637," Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.",rachel
45638," Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!",rachel
45639,"  Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?",phoebe
45640, Sure!,rachel
45641, Ok!,phoebe
45642, You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.,rachel
45643," So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?",phoebe
45644," She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!",rachel
45645, Why?,phoebe
45646," I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!",rachel
45647, Who else?,phoebe
45648," Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...",rachel
45649, You like Joey?,phoebe
45650," Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.",rachel
45651,  Oh my God!,phoebe
45652," It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!",rachel
45653," Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?",phoebe
45654,"  Oh, I get it!",rachel
45655," Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.",phoebe
45656," I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.",rachel
45657, Yeah.,phoebe
45658, So can we keep this between us?,rachel
45659, Sure!,phoebe
45660," Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!",rachel
45661, Oh.,phoebe
45662, Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?,phoebe
45663, Hi honey!,monica
45664," Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!",chandler
45665," Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!",monica
45666," You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite!  Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.",chandler
45667, I got it.,monica
45668,"  So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?",chandler
45669," Yeah, I guess.",monica
45670," So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!",chandler
45671,  Excuse me?,monica
45672," Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is ""spermtastic""!",chandler
45673," Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! ""Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm""!",monica
45674," No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.",chandler
45675, Chandler!,monica
45676," I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!",chandler
45677, I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!,monica
45678, Ok!,chandler
45679, Uh!,monica
45680,  Zack!,chandler
45681," Tell me about yourself, Zack!",monica
45682," Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!",rachel
45683," Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.",phoebe
45684," Ok, great!",rachel
45685," Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!",rachel
45686,  I didn't say anything yet!,phoebe
45687,"  Well, get back in there and talk!",rachel
45688,  I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.,phoebe
45689,  What!?,rachel
45690,"  Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.",phoebe
45691," Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!",rachel
45692, Ooh! We have a problem.,phoebe
45693, Oh! What are we gonna do?,rachel
45694, Oh my God!,rachel
45695,  Alright! Enough out of you!,rachel
45696, Hello?,joey
45697," Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?",ross
45698, No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?,joey

45702, What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!,joey
45703, Barbados.,ross
45704," Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!",joey
45705, What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.,ross
45706," Well, just wake him up!",joey
45707," I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!",ross
45708," Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and...  no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?",joey
45709, Hey guys! Dinner's ready!,monica
45710," So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!",chandler
45711," Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!",monica
45712, You don't like him.,chandler
45713, I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.,monica
45714, Alright! Just follow my lead!,chandler
45715," Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?",chandler
45716,  That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.,chandler
45717," Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?",monica
45718," Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?",monica
45719, We're just making conversation. ,monica
45720, You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness ,chandler
45721, I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?,chandler
45722, Yess!! ,monica
45723,  We're teeth people Zack!,chandler
45724, Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.,rachel
45725, Good plan.,phoebe
45726, Ok.  Wha...? where? Where are you going?,rachel
45727," Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at ""who's more over who""! ",phoebe
45728,"  Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?",rachel
45729,"  Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!",rachel
45730," Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.",rachel
45731,  Yeah.,rachel
45732," Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!",rachel
45733, Yeah...,rachel
45734,  I try...,rachel
45735,  Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! ,ross
45736,  Wow! You look... ... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!,joey
45737, Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.,phoebe
45738, Then don't go!,joey
45739," Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.",phoebe
45740," Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!",joey
45741," You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.",phoebe
45742, David?,phoebe
45743, Oh my God! ,phoebe
45744, Yeah. What-what are you doing here?,phoebe

45748, Good!,phoebe
45749,"  Oh, good for you.",phoebe
45750, Mike and I broke up.,phoebe
45751, Really?,phoebe
45752," I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!",phoebe
45753, Well...  no.,phoebe
45754, I'd love to.,phoebe
45755, Ok. ,phoebe
45756," Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.",phoebe
45757," No, that's David.",rachel
45758,  Tip of the iceberg.,rachel
45759, You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?,chandler
45760," Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.",chandler
45761, Ok.,chandler
45762, I think we've found our sperm!,chandler
45763, Does seem pretty perfect.,monica
45764," Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?",chandler
45765,  No.,monica
45766," Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!",chandler
45767," No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.",monica
45768," Yeah, he's better!",chandler
45769," No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.",monica
45770, Really? Are you sure?,chandler
45771," Yeah, I'm sure.",monica
45772,"  Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.",chandler
45773, That is so sweet. I love you. ,monica
45774, So you know this leaves us with...,chandler
45775, Adoption.,monica
45776, How do you feel about that?,chandler
45777, I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.,monica
45778, Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.,chandler
45779," So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?",monica
45780,  Yeah.,chandler
45781,"  Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!",monica
45782, We are gonna be great parents.,chandler
45783," And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there  our baby could be being conceived.",monica
45784," Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!",chandler
45785," Hey, Zack!",chandler
45786," Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.",chandler
45787, Really?,chandler
45788," My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.",chandler
45789," You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?",chandler
45790,  Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!,joey

45793,  Can you say Barbados?,ross
45794, Barbados!,joey
45795," Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right!  This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.",ross
45796, Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?,rachel
45797," Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff"".",chandler
45798, I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.,phoebe
45799," Oh, right, because he's a scientist!",ross
45800," No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.",phoebe
45801," Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.",ross
45802," All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.",joey

45813," Dude, it's just ""Days of Our Lives""... there's no the.",ross
45814,"  Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.",joey

45816," David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.",monica
45817,  See?,monica
45818," Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind"".",chandler
45819," Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.",monica
45820," Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.",phoebe
45821, Mike?? Who's Mike?,phoebe
45822," That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!",phoebe
45823," Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!",phoebe
45824,  She does?,chandler
45825,  Let's get you out of here!! ,monica
45826, At least you took me down with you!,monica
45827," I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?",phoebe
45828," I guess, in time.",monica
45829, Yeah.,phoebe
45830," I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.",monica
45831," You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!",phoebe
45832, I wouldn't read too much into it.,chandler
45833," David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.",chandler
45834," Seriously, we're gonna do this?",chandler
45835," Oh, because his pen1s was too big.  Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do.  They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?",chandler
45836, What?,chandler
45837, I didn't mean now...,chandler
45838," Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.",chandler
45839," David, I'm pretending to read here!!",chandler
45840, Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!,joey
45841," Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?",joey
45842, You really should have been more clear about that!,joey
45843, Hey!,ross
45844, Hey!,joey
45845,  You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!,ross
45846, Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?,joey
45847," Yeah, she never misses these conferences!  No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!",ross
45848, Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?,ross
45849," You could say: ""Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?"" ",joey
45850,  Ready to go?,ross
45851, Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?,joey
45852, Yeah.,ross
45853,  Will you wear a thong?,joey
45854, Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!,joey
45855,"  I'm good, I have dinner plans .",ross
45856," Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...",joey
45857," Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?",ross

45859, Oh man!,joey
45860," I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! ",joey

45862,"  I do! Want a hint? huh? ""I do""  ""I do"".",chandler
45863," Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.",monica
45864, David is going to propose to Phoebe.,chandler
45865, What?  Why?,monica
45866," Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.",chandler
45867," Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?",monica
45868," I did! A pen1s one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?",chandler
45869," They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.",monica
45870," Man, that's some bad advice!",chandler
45871, Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!,joey
45872, Hey! Hey what's going on?,rachel
45873," Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!",joey
45874," Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!",rachel
45875," Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!",monica
45876, That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!,chandler
45877," Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in ",joey
45878,"  Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!",monica
45879,"  Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!",phoebe
45880,  And make sure our room isn't next to theirs .,monica
45881," Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could  share that with a guy.",rachel
45882, Not Joey.,phoebe
45883," Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.",rachel
45884," Yeah, right!",monica
45885," Tonight?!  Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?  Oh, there it is!",chandler
45886,  Nice! ,chandler
45887," Monica, can I talk to you for a sec? ",chandler
45888, Ok!,monica
45889, David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!,chandler
45890, See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?,monica
45891, That would be advice!!,chandler
45892, Ok fine. I'll handle this.  Phoebe?,monica
45893, Yeah?,phoebe
45894,  I need to talk to you.,monica
45895," Are you leaving ""The Supremes""? ",phoebe

45897, Wow? Really? That's fantastic!,phoebe
45898, What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?,monica
45899," Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: ""Mike, do you take Phoebe...""  You know, it's every girl's dream!",phoebe
45900, Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?,monica
45901," Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!",phoebe
45902," By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.",ross
45903," Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. .",ross
45904, Hey guys!,joey
45905, The chocolates aren't here yet.,ross
45906, Damnit!,joey
45907," Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?",chandler

45910,"  What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.",rachel
45911, It's not the time Charlie.,rachel
45912,"  Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!",chandler
45913," Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?  Oh! Secret teapot?",joey
45914," Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!",chandler
45915, Wha... what do you mean? ,ross
45916, It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.,chandler
45917," What, oh my God. What did you do?",ross
45918, Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.,chandler
45919," Why, why would you open it?",ross
45920," Well, it didn't say ""This is a virus""!!",chandler
45921, What did it say?,ross
45922, Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.,chandler
45923," What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!",ross
45924," It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?",chandler
45925, NO! I don't!!,ross
45926," Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!",chandler
45927, It's really gone?,joey
45928, Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!,ross

45934," Well, what do you do?",ross
45935," Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.",rachel
45936, I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?,ross
45937, I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.,joey

45939, Wha... what you really think we can do that?,ross
45940," Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.",joey
45941, Ugh.,rachel
45942," Alright, ok, let's do it.  Um, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... um, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello!  And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.",ross
45943," Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a ""Galaxy far, far away""? .",joey
45944," Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole ""I never want to get married"" thing and step up!",monica

45949,"  Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!",chandler

45952," No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!",monica

45954," No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.",monica
45955,  Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!,chandler
45956," Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!",monica
45957, This vacation sucks!!,chandler

45970," Yeah, that's it?",ross
45971," Oh my God, we did it! ",ross

45985," Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.",joey
45986," I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.",rachel

46022," I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.",chandler
46023,  No!,phoebe
46024," I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.",phoebe

46037, Nooo!,rachel
46038, Damn it!,monica
46039,"  Walls are pretty thin, guys!",ross
46040, Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.,ross
46041," Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!",rachel
46042," Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...",ross
46043,  Not to mention the cold sores.,chandler
46044," And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.",ross
46045,  Really?,chandler
46046," But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...",ross
46047," He said ""erectus""!",joey
46048," No, he really said it.",joey
46049, ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...,ross
46050, Erectus?,joey
46051, Homo.,rachel
46052, ... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.  Thank you!,ross

46069,"  Look, I took it too far!",ross
46070,"  I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!",monica

46074, I don't think so!,chandler

46077, I'm not always that bad!,monica
46078," Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?",chandler
46079,  I punched you...?,monica
46080, And...?,chandler
46081, ... Phoebe...?,monica
46082, ... and...?,phoebe
46083, I clunked your heads together!,monica
46084," Hey!  As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! ",joey
46085,"  Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...",joey
46086,"  Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech... ",joey
46087,"  Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!",joey
46088," Yeah! A little bit, yeah...",joey
46089, Yeah... I think we do... ... about what?,joey

46325,  Uh-huh... right... yeah...,rachel
46326, And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.,ross
46327,"  Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.",rachel
46328," Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?",ross
46329,"  That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.",rachel

46340," Well, he's with Charlie now.",joey
46341," Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?",monica

46413," You know what, we're gonna have s*x. Let's just leave it there.",phoebe
46414," Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says ""duty free"".",ross

46460, Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...,ross
46461," Excuse me!  You didn't tell him, did you?",rachel
46462, I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.,joey

46478," It's ""Bolero"" from ""10"".",monica
46479," It's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from ""Apocalypse Now""... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!",chandler
46480, You what? You said you liked them.,monica
46481, Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.,chandler
46482," Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.",monica
46483," Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.",chandler
46484," You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this...  OUCH!",monica
46485, Hit yourself in the tooth?,chandler
46486, And the eye!,monica
46487,"  Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you.  Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? ",ross
46488," That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.",rachel
46489," Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.",ross
46490," Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.",rachel
46491,"  Okay, shoot!",ross
46492," Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.",rachel
46493,  OH NO!,ross
46494, What? What is it?,rachel
46495," Oh, major shampoo explosion!",ross
46496," Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.",rachel
46497," Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me? ",ross
46498, Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?,rachel
46499," I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?",ross
46500," Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...",rachel
46501," Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?",ross
46502," Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.",rachel
46503," Duh, you think? ",ross
46504," Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.",phoebe
46505," Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?",phoebe
46506," Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.",phoebe
46507," Well, I don't...",phoebe
46508," Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.",phoebe
46509," Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.",phoebe
46510," Okay, not a fan of the tough love.",phoebe
46511," But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...",phoebe
46512," Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.",phoebe
46513, You're welcome!,phoebe
46514," Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?",chandler
46515, Not really.,monica
46516, I have a problem.,monica
46517, Really? What happened?,chandler
46518," Well, I was dancing around, and singing ""No Woman, No Cry"" and I got stuck.",monica
46519, You can't move at all?,chandler
46520," Oh, well, I can move... ",monica
46521," If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?",chandler
46522,  I guess so...,monica
46523,  Some of these look a little frayed.,chandler
46524," Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.",monica
46525, Hey!,joey
46526, Hi!,rachel
46527," So, did you err... did you tell Ross?",joey
46528," Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.",rachel
46529," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. ",joey
46530," Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.",rachel
46531," Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.",joey
46532," Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...",rachel
46533," I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.",joey
46534," No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?",rachel
46535, Yeah! Good night! ,joey
46536, Goo--ood night!,rachel
46537, Good night! ,joey
46538," Seriously, good night!",rachel
46539, Stop saying good night.,joey
46540, Okay.,rachel
46541, Look what I found in the drawer...  And you said I'd never wear this...,monica
46542," Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?",chandler
46543," Sure, what do you have in mind?",monica
46544, I think you know.,chandler
46545, Really? I don't really feel like it.,monica
46546, This is what I want to do.,chandler
46547," Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.",monica
46548,"  She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.",chandler
46549," Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?",joey
46550, We weren't doing anything!,rachel
46551," Rach, he just saw us.",joey
46552, Shhh.,rachel
46553," But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.",joey
46554," No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.",rachel
46555," Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.",rachel
46556," Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..",joey
46557," We feel so terrible about this, Ross.",rachel
46558," Yeah, but it did happen, so...",joey
46559, Ross?,joey
46560, Ross?  Can we just close the door?,rachel
46561," Ross, say something. Anything.",rachel
46562, So you two are..?,ross
46563, And have you .. ed?,ross
46564," No, no, no!",joey
46565," No, no, no!",rachel
46566," But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?",ross
46567, Probably.,joey
46568," No, no!",joey
46569," Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.",rachel
46570, I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?,ross
46571," No, but you know what I mean.",rachel
46572," Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.  I'm fine!",ross
46573, Really?,joey
46574," Absolutely.  I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really,  I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like..  But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.",ross
46575, Ross..,joey
46576," It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?",ross
46577, Calm ourselves?,rachel
46578," No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!",ross
46579," Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?",joey
46580," Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!! ",ross
46581, I do like fajitas.,joey
46582," God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.",monica
46583, There's a hair in my coffee.,chandler
46584, Hey guys!,phoebe
46585, Hey.,monica
46586," Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.",phoebe
46587," You know, it's funny. Every time you say ""triplets,"" I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.",chandler
46588, That's sweet. Drink your hair.,monica
46589," Hey, what's all this stuff?",phoebe
46590," Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.",monica
46591," Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!",phoebe
46592, That's not really how it works.,monica
46593," Oh, how does it work?",phoebe
46594, I don't know!,monica
46595," Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.",phoebe
46596," Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?",monica
46597, Hey!,phoebe
46598, Good to see you.,phoebe
46599, Hi Frank.,monica
46600," Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!",monica
46601, Which one is which again?,monica
46602," Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.",joey
46603," Well, what would we be doing?",rachel
46604," I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...",joey
46605, Feel me up?,rachel
46606, In a carriage!,joey
46607," Hey, Charlie!",joey
46608, Hey.,rachel
46609," Oh, you bet.",rachel
46610," So, did you bring a little something for Ross?",joey
46611," Oh. Oh, thanks.",joey
46612," Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..",joey
46613," I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie!  Hi Joey.  And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend.  I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know.  Come, please come in. Come in.",ross
46614," Okay, well, we brought you some wine.",rachel
46615, Oh! That is so thoughtful.  She's a keeper. And what did you bring me? ,ross
46616," Uh, actually, that's..",joey
46617," Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!",ross
46618, What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?,ross
46619," Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.",joey
46620, You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.,ross
46621," Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.",phoebe
46622," Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.",phoebe
46623," Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..",phoebe
46624," That's a, that's a long time.",phoebe
46625," Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.",phoebe
46626, What?,phoebe
46627," Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!",phoebe
46628, What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?,phoebe
46629, Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.,monica
46630," So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?",chandler
46631," I mean, you have a lovely home.",chandler
46632," Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.",monica
46633, Oh my god!,monica

46635, That's great.  Can I see the book?,chandler
46636," You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?",chandler
46637, It's.. It's just so pretty and white.,monica
46638, Can I adopt you?,monica
46639," Hey, you must be Owen.",chandler
46640," I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.",chandler
46641," Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.",chandler
46642, You know how to use a compass?,chandler
46643, You do? That's fantastic!,chandler
46644," I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.",chandler
46645, What?,chandler
46646, I got nothing.,chandler
46647," The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.",ross
46648," Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.",rachel
46649," Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.",ross
46650," Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?",joey
46651," I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.",ross
46652, No awareness.,rachel
46653," We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?",ross
46654, My fajitas!!,ross
46655," Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.",rachel
46656," Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!",ross
46657," Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!",rachel
46658, That is gonna hurt tomorrow!,ross
46659," Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?",phoebe
46660, Insane.,phoebe
46661," Alice would never go for it, right?",phoebe
46662," Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?",phoebe
46663, Frank Jr.Jr.?,phoebe
46664, Uh-huh.,phoebe
46665," Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?",phoebe
46666," Alright, so that leaves Chandler.",phoebe
46667," Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.",phoebe
46668," I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.",phoebe
46669," Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.",phoebe
46670, Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.,phoebe
46671, Where are Bill and Colleen?,chandler
46672, They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?,monica
46673, We have to leave!!,chandler
46674, Why? What did you do in the bathroom?,monica
46675," I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.",chandler
46676," Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!",monica
46677, But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?,chandler
46678, See? Intuitive!,chandler
46679, Which technically now you should give back!,chandler
46680," I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. ""Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real.""",chandler
46681, Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.,ross
46682, Ooy.,rachel
46683," And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?",ross
46684," Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?",rachel
46685," O is for ""oh, wow!"" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.",ross
46686," Dude, are you okay?",joey
46687, Totally.,ross
46688," Ross, you don't seem okay.",rachel
46689, No!,ross
46690, Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.,ross
46691, Okay.,ross
46692," Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.",rachel
46693," Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!",ross
46694," You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.",rachel
46695," Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.",ross
46696," No, no, it's just that it's getting late...",rachel
46697," Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.",ross
46698, I don't even know what that's for.,ross
46699, You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.,joey
46700," Yeah, that's probably a good idea.",rachel
46701, Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.,joey
46702," Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.",rachel
46703," It doesn't look good, does it?",joey
46704, Morning. Here you go.,joey
46705, Thanks. Did you stay here all night?,ross
46706, Yeah.,joey
46707, So you took off my pants and shoes?,ross
46708," No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.",joey
46709, What do you mean?,ross
46710," Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..",joey
46711," Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!",ross
46712," It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.",joey
46713," Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?",ross
46714," That's what I hear, yeah.",joey
46715," This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?",ross
46716," Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...",joey
46717, Joey.,ross
46718, I'm crazy about her.,joey
46719, And she feels the same way?,ross
46720, I think so.,joey
46721," Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.",ross
46722," Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.",joey
46723," No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?",ross
46724," No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?",joey
46725," Yeah, I'm sure.",ross
46726, And we're okay?,joey
46727," Hey, Phoebs",monica
46728, Hey.,phoebe
46729," Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.",monica
46730," Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.",chandler
46731, What?,monica
46732," Still, he had to find out sometime.",phoebe
46733," Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?",chandler
46734, I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. ,chandler
46735," So, you and Rachel tonight, uh?",chandler
46736, Yeah. It's actually our first official date,joey
46737, Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?,chandler
46738," Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.",joey
46739, What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.,chandler
46740,  It's OK!,joey
46741, How can you be so confident?,chandler
46742," Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!",joey
46743, Really? Like you have a routine?,chandler
46744," No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.",joey
46745, Really?,chandler
46746," No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.",joey
46747, You mean like this? ,chandler
46748," NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. ",joey
46749," Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. ",chandler

46760,"  Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?",ross
46761,  Why...why?,chandler
46762," Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!",ross
46763," Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.",chandler
46764," So, do you get colours or just French tips?",ross
46765, There. Here's their card.,monica
46766," Thanks.  Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video...  florist. ",ross

46771," I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!",monica
46772, Who's Amanda?,chandler
46773," She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message.  ""Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!""",monica
46774, Are you trying to do a British accent?,chandler
46775,   Chandler gets pedicures!,monica
46776," Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?",chandler
46777," You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone?  ""Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!"" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!""",phoebe
46778," I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.",monica

46780," Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!",monica
46781," Ugh, Let's just cut her out!",phoebe
46782, What?,monica
46783, Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!,phoebe
46784," Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh!  Have you ever done that?",monica
46785," No, had it done to me though. Feels good !",chandler
46786," Well... I like how you look, what are you?",ross
46787," Two, I think a two.",ross
46788," Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.",ross
46789," Well, I have a PhD, so... ",ross

46795, I'm a four?,ross
46796,  Really!,ross

46917,  I am scrappy.,monica
46918," Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.",phoebe
46919, It's because I'm scrappy.,monica

46938," I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.",chandler
46939," Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.",rachel
46940," Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.",joey
46941," Right, totally.",rachel
46942," Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.",joey

46944, That's a... pla-an.,joey
46945,  Wow... I did not see this coming.,joey
46946, I know.,rachel
46947," I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.",joey
46948, Hmmm... Me too...,rachel
46949, I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?,rachel

46971," Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?",monica
46972, No.,ross
46973," No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!",rachel
46974, Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!,chandler
46975," C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.",ross
46976," Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.",monica
46977, There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...,chandler
46978," Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?",rachel
46979," Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird s*x stuff to my little sister.",ross
46980," And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!",rachel
46981," All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.",monica
46982," Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...",chandler
46983," Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!",monica
46984," You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.",rachel
46985," Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!",phoebe
46986,  Hey guys!,ross
46987," Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.",ross
46988," Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.",rachel
46989," Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!",phoebe
46990, Yeah!,ross
46991," Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!",phoebe
46992," That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?",ross
46993," Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.",rachel
46994," Ah, and where is Joey?",ross
46995, I said it's still nap time.,rachel

46998," Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!",ross
46999," 18, uh? ",joey
47000," Joey, NO!",ross
47001," What, what!? it's for her hot friends!",joey
47002, When they see this you'll be 52!,ross

47004," Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?",rachel
47005, I'd love to! Yeah! ,joey
47006,  We were supposed to bring presents?,joey
47007, Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.,phoebe
47008," Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?",joey
47009," Joey, it's a birthday party.",phoebe
47010," Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says ""El-moo""!  Yeah... that's a funny cup!",joey
47011, Hey!,monica
47012, Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?,chandler
47013," Oh, she's still napping",rachel
47014," Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.",chandler
47015," Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.",rachel
47016, All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!,monica
47017," No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.",rachel
47018," Are you freaking kidding me, Green?",monica
47019,  Hey!,ross
47020, So glad you came!,monica
47021,  There's something you didn't know about your dad!,ross
47022, Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.,joey
47023," Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!",joey
47024, I can't believe Emma is still asleep!,monica
47025," I know, what are we gonna do?",chandler
47026, I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!,monica
47027, I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!,chandler
47028," Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!",joey
47029, So you’re gonna... hit on her?,phoebe
47030," No, no, no! My talents as an actor!",joey
47031, Oh!,phoebe
47032," You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!",joey
47033, Or you could stick a fork in an apple!,phoebe
47034," Hey, I think Emma might like it!",joey
47035, Oh! Emma might like what?,rachel
47036," Um, my present!",joey
47037, What did you get her?,rachel
47038, Actually we prepared performances.,joey
47039, Separate performances.,phoebe
47040, But equally real!,joey
47041," Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?",rachel
47042," Sure, yeah!",phoebe
47043,  O K.,joey
47044,"  All right, let’s get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.",rachel
47045," Oh, great!",ross
47046,  Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?,phoebe
47047," Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!",joey
47048," So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?",rachel
47049, I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma’s books.,joey
47050," Oh, ok, which one?",rachel
47051," Uh, why, it’s a...  one of her favorites, uh,  “Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression” eesh!  “Love you forever”. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed  in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”. . And while he rocked her, he sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”.",joey
47052,  Wow! That was amazing!,rachel
47053, Thank you so much for that gift!,ross
47054, Amazing... amazing.,ross
47055," Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.",rachel
47056," That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music.  Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!",phoebe
47057, Is that it?,rachel
47058," No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading . “s*x and the single mother.  Finding your G-spot.",phoebe
47059," Ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s in a box in the fridge.",rachel
47060, Sure.,ross
47061," Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino’s.",rachel
47062," Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.",monica
47063," Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!",rachel
47064," Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?",monica
47065, Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.,rachel
47066," Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?",ross
47067," Ross, what are you talking about?  oh! Oh my God! They put my baby’s face on a pen1s!",rachel
47068," Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!",rachel
47069, I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.,ross
47070," Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the pen1s, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!",ross
47071," Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home...  Joey, don't touch it!!",rachel
47072, I'm so confused!,joey
47073,"  Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!",rachel
47074, To be fair this one does have nuts.,chandler
47075," Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.",ross
47076," Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!",monica
47077," Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh?  Ok!",ross
47078, Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?,chandler
47079," We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!",monica
47080," We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. ",chandler
47081," Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.",monica
47082," And you know, I have a massage client soon.",phoebe
47083," You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?",ross
47084," Alright, 5 more minutes.",monica
47085,"  Hello?  Oh no! What happened?  Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there. ",ross
47086, Was that Emma? Is she up?,chandler
47087," No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.",ross
47088," Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.",phoebe
47089, No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us  We've been complaining the longest!,monica
47090," No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?",ross
47091, I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!,chandler
47092," Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves! ",ross

47098," Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.",joey
47099," No, it did not.",phoebe
47100, No.,joey
47101, Ok! ,joey
47102, Nighty-night!,joey
47103," Bye, bye.",joey
47104, Joey? How could you just let them leave?,phoebe
47105," Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.",joey
47106," No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.",monica
47107,  Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in. ,joey
47108," You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?",chandler

47143," Hey, good race you guys.",joey
47144," Yeah, see you later!",phoebe
47145," No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose.  The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...",monica

47154," Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else. ",ross
47155," Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.",rachel
47156," Rach, she's not going to remember this.",ross
47157,"  I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing ""Happy Birthday"". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!!  They have to learn!",rachel
47158,  Hey!,ross
47159, What?,rachel
47160, It's not bad.,ross

47163," Well, I'm very impressed.",rachel
47164," Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.",ross
47165," Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.",monica
47166," I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?",chandler
47167, Game?,monica
47168," Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.",chandler
47169, Ooh! That's my girl!,chandler

47172,"  Ooh, I want one...",monica
47173, Me too...,chandler

47180," Oh good, I didn't miss the party.",phoebe
47181, What about your massage client?,monica
47182," I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.",phoebe
47183," Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!",joey
47184,  I've been here the whole time!,joey
47185," Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.",ross

47209, Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!,joey
47210, I've never given her a cookie. Have you?,rachel
47211," No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!",joey
47212," Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.",monica
47213," Of course, I'd be honored!",rachel
47214, Thanks!,chandler
47215, Thank you!,monica
47216," U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.",joey
47217," Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.",chandler
47218," Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much ""with the words"".",monica
47219, Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!,joey

47233, Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?,joey
47234," Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have s*x in a public rest room.",phoebe
47235, You guys do that? Chandler won't even have s*x in our bathroom!,monica

47271," Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?",rachel
47272," Sometimes just nodding is ok.  Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!",rachel

47281,  I don’t... uh... understand.,chandler
47282,  Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?,joey
47283,  It doesn’t make any sense.,monica
47284, Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!,joey
47285, On every word?,chandler
47286, Yep!,joey
47287," Alright, what was this sentence originally? ",monica
47288," Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.",joey
47289, And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?,chandler
47290," Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.",joey
47291," Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.",monica
47292, Why not?,joey
47293," Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!",monica
47294," You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here,  your full sized aortic pump.",chandler
47295," Amy, hi!",rachel
47296," Oh, good for you!",rachel

47304," Joey, I can’t do that!",rachel
47305," Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said  ""Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!"" I don’t need that kind of talk in my house!",joey
47306," Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think it’s really good that she’s here.",rachel
47307, 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?,joey
47308," No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.",rachel
47309," Yeah, Monica made us!",joey
47310," Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok.",rachel
47311, Yeaah.,joey
47312," Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why I hung it on the door.",rachel
47313," Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.",rachel
47314,"  I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!",joey
47315, Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.,phoebe

47323," Oh, that is so tacky.",rachel
47324," Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!",phoebe
47325," Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?",monica
47326," Phoebe, that’s huge!",rachel
47327," Well, do you wanna marry him?",ross
47328," Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!",phoebe
47329, She's right! If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a guy..?,chandler
47330," Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!",monica
47331," Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?",phoebe
47332," I proposed to Chandler!  Alright, moving on...",monica
47333," Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!",chandler
47334, Thank you.,monica

47336, I think it could be kind of great!,rachel
47337, Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!,ross
47338," Ok, ok, so how should I do it?",phoebe
47339," How about at a game, on the big screen?",monica
47340,  Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? ,rachel
47341," What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!",monica
47342," Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?",phoebe
47343, Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?,chandler
47344,"  Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!",rachel
47345,"  Hello?  Oh, it's our nanny!  Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye!   That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?",rachel
47346," No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?",ross
47347, Menstrual cramps.,rachel
47348, I don't think that's what this is.,ross
47349,  Can any of you watch Emma?,rachel

47360," Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.",ross
47361,  Wha... the next one?,rachel
47362,"  Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.",ross
47363," Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!",rachel
47364, I... I don't know..,ross
47365," Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows  shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?",rachel
47366, Absolutely.,rachel
47367, Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?,chandler
47368," Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.",joey
47369, You dropped it off?,monica
47370, Yeah.,joey
47371, Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?,chandler
47372," No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it. ",joey
47373, You hand-wrote it?,monica
47374," Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later! ",joey
47375," Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!",monica

47380,  They loved it.,chandler
47381, What?,monica
47382, They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.,chandler
47383,  They thought Joey was a child?,monica
47384," She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.",chandler
47385," Hey, what did you guys do today?",monica
47386, That sounds like fun.,chandler
47387,"  Hey! Hi, how's my girl?",rachel
47388,  Yeah!,rachel

47396," Nah, I don't really want her to see.",rachel
47397, Why not?,ross
47398, Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.,monica
47399, Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?,chandler
47400, Come here  Oh! There she is! Hi!,ross
47401,  What?,ross
47402, Nothing.,rachel

47407," I'm a cool, fun aunt!",monica
47408, Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!,chandler
47409, I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?,rachel
47410, Oh yeah? Since when?,rachel
47411,  What?,rachel
47412, That's not a thing!,ross

47436, Did you just say Emma?,rachel
47437," That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.",phoebe
47438,"  I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.",phoebe
47439," It's in the cake, isn't it?",phoebe

47488," Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the ""Paleontology Review""! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!",ross
47489, Yeah. Why?,ross
47490, Your ex-boyfriend?,ross
47491," So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!",ross

47500," Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!",monica

47502," Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?",monica
47503, A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.,phoebe

47507," Why, you don't like her?",phoebe
47508," Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!",monica
47509, Really? You think?,phoebe
47510," Absolutely! Yes, you say to him ""I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!""",monica
47511," Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.",phoebe
47512," Damn it, I did not think this through!",monica
47513, Hey you guys.,chandler
47514, Hi!,rachel

47517," What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?",joey
47518," I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.",rachel
47519, Joe...,chandler
47520," Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!",joey

47523," Work, Joe!",chandler
47524, Damn it! ,joey
47525, Just pass it to your boss!,joey
47526," He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!",chandler
47527," Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.",rachel
47528," That's good! I liked it, they didn't.  Joey, for God's sake, go to work! .",chandler
47529, I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?,ross
47530," Well, I... I am having a good hair day.",ross
47531, I'm ok.,ross
47532," It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,  whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.",ross
47533," No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.",ross
47534," Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.",ross
47535," See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.",ross
47536, What?,ross
47537," Did you just say ""break up with Charlie""?",ross
47538," Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?",ross
47539, Are you serious?,ross
47540, No!,ross
47541," Hi! Sorry, I'm late.",phoebe
47542," Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?",monica
47543," No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!",phoebe
47544," Wow, what's the bad news!",monica
47545, Who's Gladys?,rachel
47546," Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.",phoebe
47547,"  Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!",rachel
47548," Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!",phoebe
47549, Huh!,monica
47550," Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...",rachel
47551," You know, I would give her up, for you.",monica
47552," No, I couldn't let you do that.",rachel
47553, But I want to.,monica
47554, But I don't want you to.,rachel
47555, But I insist!,monica
47556, But I insist harder!,rachel
47557," Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. . Tails! Monica, she's yours!",phoebe
47558," No, that landed in your food!",monica
47559,"  No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!",rachel
47560, Hey Joe!,chandler
47561, What's up?,joey

47563,  Oh.,joey
47564,  I'm sorry man.,chandler
47565,"  But, ehm... you watched the tape?",joey
47566,"  Yeah! I... I... I liked it!  But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!",chandler
47567,  You didn't watch the tape.,joey
47568,  What!? Of course I did!,chandler
47569," Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?",joey
47570," I'm not lying to you, I watched it!",chandler
47571," Well, you lied again! ",joey
47572, I watched it!,chandler
47573, Keep going Pinocchio!,joey
47574,   I did!,chandler

47581,  May 12th?,ross
47582,  Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.,ross

47584,"  um... I've never heard of a ""Boscodictiasaur"".",ross
47585,  Ok.  B - O - S ...,ross
47586, Oh come on!!,ross
47587, I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!,chandler
47588, But you are a liar.,rachel
47589, What did I just say?,chandler
47590, You still here?,joey
47591," Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...",chandler
47592," Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying...   Stop lying!",joey
47593, Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?,chandler
47594,  You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why? ,joey
47595," Well, this is going well. ",rachel
47596,"  Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok?  If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. ",joey
47597,  And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! .,joey
47598, He really is a chameleon.,chandler
47599,"  Well, Gladys say hello to your new home! ",phoebe

47602,  I haven't really settled on a spot yet!,monica

47604,"  Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.",phoebe
47605,  I like that poster!,monica
47606, Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?,phoebe
47607,  Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!,rachel
47608,  Are you still here?,monica
47609," Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps?  Aunt Margaret's pants size?",ross

47620," Joey, we're not keeping this!",rachel
47621, But it's an original Buffay...,joey
47622," Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.",rachel
47623, Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?,joey
47624," Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.",rachel
47625," She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal.  And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.",rachel
47626, GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!,joey
47627, Hey! I sold that to Joey.,monica
47628," Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game. ",rachel
47629," No, too late. You can't give it back! ",monica

47644, She's mine!,monica

47646," Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.",chandler
47647, That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.,joey
47648, I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?,chandler
47649, Oh my God!,monica
47650, Excellent!,rachel
47651," Now, what do you say?",joey
47652, Lying is wrong!,chandler
47653, And?... AND?,joey
47654, I'm a pretty little girl.,chandler
47655, I knew it!,phoebe
47656, Your ex-boyfriend is insane.,ross
47657," No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.",ross
47658," Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.",ross
47659," Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of ""Underdog""?",ross
47660," If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.",ross
47661," Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?",ross
47662, Damnit!,ross
47663," I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!",ross
47664," No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.",ross
47665," Too little, too late, Benji!",ross
47666,  No!,ross
47667, What?,ross
47668, or...,ross
47669," Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.",ross
47670," Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!",ross
47671, Gladys?,joey
47672," Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.",rachel
47673, You're mean!,joey
47674," Oh, don't be such a baby!",rachel
47675, Hey you guys!,ross
47676, Hey!,phoebe
47677," Hey, what are you doing?",ross
47678," That's funny, we were doing the same thing!",chandler
47679, Yeah!,ross
47680," It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!",phoebe
47681," Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.",chandler
47682, So what did you two do about it?,phoebe
47683," It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.",chandler
47684," There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.",ross
47685," Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.",ross
47686," But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?",phoebe
47687," Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?",phoebe
47688," I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!",ross
47689,  Maybe you do that next time you get married!,chandler
47690," No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. [pause] But maybe the time after that!",ross
47691, Hey!,joey
47692, Hey!,chandler
47693, What's going on?,joey
47694, Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.,chandler
47695,  We?,monica
47696, You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!,chandler
47697," Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?",joey
47698, Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.,chandler
47699," And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.",monica
47700," Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.",joey
47701,  Little people?,chandler
47702,  Celebrity.,joey
47703," Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... p0rn or cigarettes?",monica
47704, What...? NO!,chandler
47705, Chandler?,monica
47706,"  I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!",chandler
47707," Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?",monica
47708," I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.",chandler
47709, It isn't mine!,monica
47710,"  Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!",joey
47711, Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.,phoebe
47712," Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one ",phoebe
47713, And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.,phoebe
47714, Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.,phoebe
47715, Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.,phoebe
47716," Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!",phoebe
47717," Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts! ",phoebe
47718, Mhm... it's moist.,phoebe
47719,  Hi!,ross
47720, Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!,rachel
47721," Oh, good!",ross
47722," Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.",rachel
47723," Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.",ross
47724, Absolutely.,rachel
47725, There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!,ross
47726," So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?",rachel
47727," Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!",ross
47728," Oh my God, what!?",rachel
47729, Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!,ross
47730," Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.",rachel
47731, Be-caaauuuse...,ross
47732,"  All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.",rachel
47733, Seriously?,ross
47734," Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair!  And it was uneven for weeks!",rachel
47735,  And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!,ross
47736," Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.",rachel
47737," Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!",ross
47738," Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!",rachel
47739," Space is filled with orbiting children.  Look, please, just come on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you won’t regret it.",ross
47740, All right!,rachel
47741," Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?",ross
47742," Irrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!",rachel
47743," Oh, yeah, that’s the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!",ross
47744," Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!",monica
47745," Ok, ok, here we go.",chandler
47746, Ok.,monica
47747, Here we go. Stand up straight.  Big smile. ,chandler
47748," Hello, is this the creepy residence?",phoebe
47749," We’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad you’re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don’t know if you wanna use it, but…",monica
47750," Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing a veil, I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!",phoebe
47751, I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!,monica
47752," No, no, no, we’re not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.",phoebe
47753, That’s crazy! . I am sorry. I just can’t imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!,monica
47754," We, you know, we’re different! We don’t care about having a huge party.  This is really nice for you, but, oh, please, I put this on?  And, ow, I look , why, well, radiant.  All right, well, who cares, I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.",phoebe

47887, Hey!,phoebe
47888, Are you kidding?,ross
47889," Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.",chandler
47890,  That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!,ross
47891," No, no! We made this decision together.",chandler
47892, She's putting words in your mouth!,ross

47904," Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!",monica

47910, You're not making the pies yourself?,phoebe
47911," No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.",monica

47923," Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!",rachel
47924,  Oh... okay.,phoebe
47925," Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...",rachel
47926, And a thousand dollars.,rachel
47927," ...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that  what's in the inside is important...",rachel
47928," Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.",phoebe
47929, Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?,rachel

47934, Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?,chandler
47935,  I don't get older. I just get better!,monica

47937, You don't know that.,monica
47938, Somebody is gonna pick us.,chandler
47939," Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!",monica
47940," I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing.  What, he's my favourite author!",chandler

47942,"  ""The Firm""?",chandler
47943," Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...",monica
47944," You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.",chandler
47945," Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.",monica
47946," I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing ""high profile"".",chandler
47947," Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.",monica
47948, Tell me more.,chandler
47949," Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these  Not with soap!! ",monica

47963," So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.",joey
47964," You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.",chandler
47965," Dude, two times that happened!",joey
47966," Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!",chandler

48000, Ohhhh! These seats are great!,joey

48060," We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time!  OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.",phoebe
48061,  That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.,ross
48062," You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. ",rachel

48172, I left them at the park.,joey
48173, Oh!,monica

48211," I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!",joey
48212, And so incorrect!,chandler
48213, She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.,monica
48214," Come on, she's gonna love you guys!",ross
48215," Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.",chandler
48216, And a lot could still get in our way.,monica
48217," Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..",chandler
48218, What are you gonna name the baby?,phoebe
48219, I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.,chandler
48220," But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?",joey
48221, Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!,monica
48222, So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?,chandler

48224," Yes, but...",chandler

48234," Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.",joey
48235, Mandy.,phoebe
48236," Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?",joey

48255, Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!,ross
48256," Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?",phoebe

48272,"  Let her finish, doctor.",monica

48277, Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?,phoebe
48278, Nope.,joey
48279, What are you talking about? Sarah's great!,phoebe
48280," Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok?  We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...",joey
48281," That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!",phoebe
48282," Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.",joey
48283, What?,phoebe

48285," I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!",phoebe
48286," Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!",joey

48288, Hi,rachel
48289, Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!,phoebe
48290, what?,rachel

48296, Oh no! Not me! Emma!,rachel
48297,  JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!,joey
48298," Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!",phoebe
48299,"  I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks.  What were we talking about?",joey

48317, Really?,ross
48318," Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you.",rachel
48319," So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?",ross
48320,  Why do men keep talking to me like this?,rachel
48321," So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?",chandler
48322, Amen.,monica
48323, Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!,chandler
48324," Uh, good hands.  Healing hands.",monica
48325, It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.,monica
48326," Yeah, wow.",chandler
48327," Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.",monica
48328, No-ot for me it doesn’t.,chandler
48329," Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?",chandler
48330, You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..,chandler
48331, We don’t?,monica
48332," Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?",monica

48341,  So? What do you think? ,ross
48342, I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!,joey
48343,  Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.,ross
48344,"  Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.",joey
48345," Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?",ross
48346,  Looks like someone IS the ladies!!,joey
48347," You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me  I have a date.  See?  ALL eyes on ME!",ross
48348, We are NOT signing those papers.,chandler
48349, Why not?,monica
48350, It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.,chandler
48351, God works in mysterious ways.,monica
48352, You have gotta stop!,chandler
48353, But she liked us.,monica
48354, She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.,chandler
48355," Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor. ",monica
48356," Your Veal Chop is $34,95!",chandler
48357," C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.",monica
48358, But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?,chandler
48359,  Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.,monica
48360, I know..,chandler
48361," I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?",monica
48362," oh, honey..",chandler
48363,"  Please.. please, we are so close.",monica
48364," Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. ",chandler
48365,"  okay, right. ",monica
48366," So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.",chandler
48367,  Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?,monica
48368, You're Jewish.,chandler
48369, Technicality!,monica
48370," Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!",joey

48378," WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!",joey
48379," I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean  There are things you do..and you now, things..  that you don't do .",joey

48395, Hey.,chandler
48396,  I-Is... Is that a picture?,monica
48397," Look, doctor!",monica
48398, The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.,chandler
48399, I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.,chandler
48400," Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.",chandler
48401," Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. ",monica
48402," Well, we...  ""bore false witness""... See I could be a reverend.",monica
48403, But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...,monica
48404," Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...",monica
48405, Erica wait!,chandler
48406, You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.,chandler
48407," Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.",chandler
48408," But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?",chandler
48409, You still want that baby?,chandler
48410, God bless you Chandler Bing!,monica
48411, Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.,ross

48527, Oh my God.,ross
48528, Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!,joey

48530," And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...",monica
48531, ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.,chandler
48532,  So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?,ross
48533," Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?",phoebe

48544, I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.,chandler

48919, Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.,ross
48920, Oh my God! That's wild!,monica
48921," Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.",chandler
48922," Well, it matters to me.",ross
48923, Why?,chandler
48924, Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.,ross
48925, You kissed her that night too?,chandler
48926," Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.",monica
48927," Seriously, where did this happen?",chandler
48928," Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.",ross
48929, Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?,chandler
48930, Mine.,ross
48931, I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.,chandler

48961," Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.",joey
48962,"  Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy!  Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!",phoebe

48976, What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.,phoebe
48977, Ooh... she backed out.,monica
48978, She did? Why?,phoebe
48979," I made her.  Steel drums don't really say ""elegant wedding"". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.",monica
48980,  Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.,phoebe
48981, Hey!,chandler
48982, Hey!,phoebe
48983," You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.",chandler

48985, No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.,chandler
48986, Rehearse it!,phoebe

48995," Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?",joey
48996," Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?",joey

48998," Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!",joey
48999,  You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.,chandler

49040," Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!",joey
49041," So, what did you decide?",ross
49042, I decided to pee.,phoebe
49043, Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.,chandler
49044," Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!",phoebe

49052," Ok, it's 2100 hours.  Time for your toast. ",monica
49053," You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!",monica
49054,"  It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. ",monica
49055," Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. . My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I...  oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because...  it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and  but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...",phoebe

49064," Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.",monica

49066," Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages. ",monica
49067," Wow, this is a lot!",phoebe
49068," Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.",monica

49070, Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.,monica
49071, Hey!,ross

49073, Where's Rach?,ross
49074," She's in her room, why?",monica
49075," I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! .  Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!",ross
49076, What d'you want?,rachel
49077," You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?",ross
49078," Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!",rachel
49079, I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!,ross
49080," Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!",rachel
49081," Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!",ross
49082," Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!",rachel
49083,"  YES, YES!",ross
49084, Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?,phoebe
49085, I know.,monica
49086," Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word ""lorkins"" what flowers would that be?",phoebe

49088,  Hello Michael.,joey

49091," More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for ""Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal.""",joey
49092," I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.",joey
49093,"  That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.",joey
49094,  That was ME!,joey
49095, Hi,rachel
49096," Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!",chandler
49097," Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.",rachel
49098," Let me tell you why you need to pick me.  See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.",chandler
49099," All right fine, I pick you.",rachel
49100,"  Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make ""groom"" for Chandler.",chandler
49101,  Oh my...,rachel

49108,"  Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?",phoebe
49109,  How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? ,joey

49130," Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?",phoebe
49131,  How's it going?,monica

49151, I know.,phoebe
49152," Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?",rachel
49153, What?,phoebe
49154," Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!",rachel
49155,  What do you think?,phoebe
49156," Me too!  Monica, do you think we could do it?",phoebe
49157,  AFFIRMATIVE!,monica
49158,"  OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights.  Okay, who left the ice sculpture  ON THE STEAM GRATE? ",monica

49395, How?,monica
49396," I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?",chandler
49397," Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.",monica

49543, Good for you. That was really mature.,phoebe
49544," What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.",joey
49545," Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...",phoebe
49546," All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.",phoebe
49547," Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that ""thing"". What is it?",joey
49548, I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye! ,joey
49549,"  Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.",rachel
49550, Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.,rachel
49551, But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.,rachel
49552, Sssshhhh!,rachel

49558," Okay. Oh, yeah...  Oh he's cute!",rachel
49559, Wha... My resumé? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.,rachel
49560,  Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?,rachel
49561, What? I-I don't.,rachel
49562," No, I-I-I love it there.",rachel
49563,  This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself.  But you obviously haven't.,phoebe

49565," Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?",phoebe
49566," Well, not anything, I mean...",phoebe
49567," Oh, this could take a while.",phoebe
49568, Okay.,phoebe

49571," Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.",phoebe
49572," Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.",monica

49574, That's what we were gonna name the baby.,chandler
49575, Phoebe!,monica
49576, Uh! Princess Consuela.,phoebe
49577, You seriously changed your name to that?,monica
49578, Uh-huh!,phoebe
49579," Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?",monica
49580," Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.",phoebe
49581," Hey, how'd the interview go?",chandler
49582, Oh! It's not good.,rachel
49583," You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.",chandler
49584," Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.",rachel
49585, That is a bad interview.,chandler
49586," What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?",phoebe
49587," Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said ""Wait a minute! Yes I am."" and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.",rachel
49588, Oh God. I'm so sorry.,monica
49589," Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this?  Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?",ross
49590, Ross...,phoebe

49592," This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!",ross
49593," Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good.  Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.",ross
49594, Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!,chandler
49595," I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?",ross
49596," Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.",rachel
49597," Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.",ross
49598, Can you?,phoebe
49599," Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!",rachel
49600, And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.,ross
49601, And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything. ,phoebe
49602, But also knowing it means a lot.,ross
49603, But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.,monica
49604, ...that center around work.,ross
49605, To Ross!,chandler
49606, You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.,ross
49607, Oh God!,phoebe
49608," No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry.  Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.",ross
49609,"  No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.",rachel
49610," Rach, I'm so sorry.",ross
49611, Oh!,rachel
49612, Great. I feel like an idiot.,ross
49613," No, it's okay, you didn't know.",rachel
49614, Oh...  Little heads-up would have been nice.,ross
49615, Thank you for letting us see the house again.,monica

49617," Ah, so glad you decided to come.",monica
49618," Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.",joey
49619, What?,chandler
49620, Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.,joey
49621, No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.,monica
49622, Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.,joey
49623, Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.,monica
49624," Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark. ",joey
49625, No it's not!,monica
49626,  Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!,joey
49627," When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?",chandler
49628,"  Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.",joey
49629," Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.",monica
49630," FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound.  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...",joey
49631," Joey, we know that's you.",monica

49640," Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?",phoebe
49641, Mike Crap Bag?,phoebe
49642," You're not serious, right?",phoebe
49643," Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it.",phoebe
49644, And I love Crap.,phoebe
49645,  Ow!,joey
49646," Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?",joey
49647,  Oh.,joey

49649,"  Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!",joey
49650," Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.",joey
49651,"  Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?",joey
49652," What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.",joey
49653," Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.",joey
49654," Yeah, yeah, I guess.",joey
49655,"  Yeah, maybe.",joey
49656,"  I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?",joey
49657,  Just when I thought we could be friends. ,joey
49658," Oh, thank you... ",rachel
49659,"  Well, now I don't have to. ",rachel
49660,"  Ross, what is taking you so long?",rachel
49661,"   I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!",ross
49662,  Mark? Oh my God! ,rachel

49664," Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so... ",ross

49773, How is that gonna happen?,monica
49774, Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?,chandler
49775, I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.,ross
49776, You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?,monica
49777, I didn't say we were brothers.,ross
49778," Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.",monica
49779," We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.",chandler
49780, But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?,monica
49781, What do you think Pheebs?,chandler
49782," Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?",phoebe
49783, Yeah.,chandler
49784, She died.,phoebe
49785, You're kidding!,chandler
49786, That's terrible!,monica

49789," Yeah, she was just an agent.",phoebe
49790, Joey's gonna be *so* upset.,monica
49791, I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.,chandler
49792," Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.",phoebe
49793," Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?",monica
49794," Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.",phoebe
49795, What if he reads it in the paper?,monica
49796," Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.",chandler
49797," Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.",ross
49798, Close. Ron. ,ross
49799," Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.",ross
49800," Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.",ross
49801," Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?",ross
49802,"  Huh, I took a shot there.",ross
49803, I see... Thanks very much.  Is this your son?,ross
49804," Oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?",ross
49805," How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s not good. Let me start again. I’m a paleontologist, you’ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!",ross
49806," You let Rachel come back, and it’s done.",ross
49807," Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.",ross

49809, Hey Phoebe.,joey
49810, Hey. Everything ok?,phoebe
49811, I’m just mad at my agent.,joey
49812, Estelle? Why?,phoebe
49813, There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn’t even be put up for it! She’d better have a good reason.,joey
49814, I’m guessing she does.,phoebe
49815," Well  I’m wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.",joey
49816," Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.",phoebe
49817, Ok. Why?,joey
49818, Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. ,phoebe
49819, I love that saying!,joey
49820, Hello?,joey
49821," Joey, it’s Estelle.",phoebe
49822, I was just gonna call you! That’s weird.,joey
49823," It’s a little coincidental, but believable. . Listen, I’m sure you’re wondering why I didn’t get you an audition for that TV movie.",phoebe
49824," Yeah, actually I am!",joey
49825, I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!,phoebe
49826," That’s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.",joey
49827," Don’t take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?",phoebe
49828," No, no, look. All I’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok? And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it.",joey
49829, What are you saying?,phoebe
49830," I’m saying that… . This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you’re fired. Goodbye. .",joey
49831," Man, tough week for Estelle!",phoebe
49832, Hi.,ross
49833, Hi.,rachel
49834, Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can’t sleep without it.,ross
49835," Oh, well, she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.",rachel
49836, Ok.,ross
49837," Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!",rachel
49838, Nooo!,ross
49839," Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.",rachel
49840," So, you’re not going to Paris.",ross
49841," No, I’m still going.",rachel
49842, Wh… wh…what?,ross
49843," When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn’t that great?",rachel
49844, Yeeeah! ,ross
49845," Hi. We’re buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.",monica
49846, Thanks.,monica
49847," It feels like we’re cheating on our house. And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won’t do?",chandler
49848," Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!",monica
49849, Love it!,monica
49850," They could be our neighbors, what are they like?",monica
49851," Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?",phoebe
49852," Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.",joey
49853," No, that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.",phoebe
49854," I don’t know. She’s got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I’m guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I’m gonna call her and hire her again.",joey
49855," No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you ",phoebe
49856, Why?,joey
49857, Because patience is the road to understanding  which ... is the key... to a happy heart.,phoebe
49858,  You blow me away.,joey
49859,"  All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?",phoebe
49860," I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. ",joey
49861, And yet I never run into Beyonce!,chandler
49862,"  Don't, don't! ",chandler
49863," No, actually, we're buying the house next door. ",monica
49864,  Why!?,chandler
49865,  I don't know why.,monica
49866, This can not be happening!,chandler
49867," Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.",monica
49868," The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.",chandler
49869,"  Okay, Okay,  All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.",monica
49870," That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?",chandler
49871," Okay, you come up with an idea.",monica
49872," Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.",chandler
49873, But we love our house.,monica
49874," Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and  ""Oh My God""!",chandler
49875," Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body. ",monica
49876,"  Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door.  Oh, that does it too. ",chandler
49877,"  It's me. Ron.  Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.",ross
49878, Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise? ,ross
49879, Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this  genuine pterodactyl egg  replica.,ross
49880, Huh? So? We have a deal?,ross
49881, Yes! yes!,ross
49882," Oh,  Believe me, the ladies, they love it!",ross
49883," Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much. ",ross

49890," No, no, no!  Don't drop by, don't drop by!",joey
49891," Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.",phoebe

49910, They did?,ross
49911, Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.,rachel
